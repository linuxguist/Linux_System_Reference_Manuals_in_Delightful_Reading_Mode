<blockquote>
<p>Normally, the script presents the information in a human readable
tabular format, but that may be harder for a machine to parse. With this
option, the output is a compact, colon separated line, with no dividers,
headers, or footer.</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This script takes a set of arguments, each of which is a package name
(and thus does not contain a /) or a full path to a configuration file,
and outputs the associated package, if any, if the file exists on disk,
and whether it has been modified by the user. The output is either a
human readable tabular form, or a compact colon-separated machine
friendly format.</p>
<p>This script can potentially be used in package <code>postrm</code>
scripts during purge to query the system for configuration files that
may still exist on the system, and whether these files have been locally
modified by the user Î©- assuming that the package registered all the
configuration files with <strong>ucf</strong> using
<code>ucfr</code>.</p>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>This is very inchoate, at the moment, and needs testing.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>None Known so far.</p>
