<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>nc - TCP/IP swiss army knife</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>nc</strong> <em>[-options] hostname port[s] [ports]
...</em><br />
<strong>nc</strong> <em>-l -p port [-options] [hostname] [port]</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>netcat</strong> is a simple unix utility which reads and
writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is
designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or
easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a
feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities. Netcat, or "nc" as the actual program is named,
should have been supplied long ago as another one of those cryptic but
standard Unix tools.</p>
<p>In the simplest usage, "nc host port" creates a TCP connection to the
given port on the given target host. Your standard input is then sent to
the host, and anything that comes back across the connection is sent to
your standard output. This continues indefinitely, until the network
side of the connection shuts down. Note that this behavior is different
from most other applications which shut everything down and exit after
an end-of-file on the standard input.</p>
<p>Netcat can also function as a server, by listening for inbound
connections on arbitrary ports and then doing the same reading and
writing. With minor limitations, netcat doesn't really care if it runs
in "client" or "server" mode -- it still shovels data back and forth
until there isn't any more left. In either mode, shutdown can be forced
after a configurable time of inactivity on the network side.</p>
<p>And it can do this via UDP too, so netcat is possibly the "udp
telnet-like" application you always wanted for testing your UDP-mode
servers. UDP, as the "U" implies, gives less reliable data transmission
than TCP connections and some systems may have trouble sending large
amounts of data that way, but it's still a useful capability to
have.</p>
<p>You may be asking "why not just use telnet to connect to arbitrary
ports?" Valid question, and here are some reasons. Telnet has the
"standard input EOF" problem, so one must introduce calculated delays in
driving scripts to allow network output to finish. This is the main
reason netcat stays running until the *network* side closes. Telnet also
will not transfer arbitrary binary data, because certain characters are
interpreted as telnet options and are thus removed from the data stream.
Telnet also emits some of its diagnostic messages to standard output,
where netcat keeps such things religiously separated from its *output*
and will never modify any of the real data in transit unless you
*really* want it to. And of course telnet is incapable of listening for
inbound connections, or using UDP instead. Netcat doesn't have any of
these limitations, is much smaller and faster than telnet, and has many
other advantages.</p>

must have one).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>-e filename</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>specify filename to exec after connect (use with caution). See the
<em>-c</em> option for enhanced functionality.</p>

<h1>COPYRIGHT</h1>
<p>Netcat is entirely my own creation, although plenty of other code was
used as examples. It is freely given away to the Internet community in
the hope that it will be useful, with no restrictions except giving
credit where it is due. No GPLs, Berkeley copyrights or any of that
nonsense. The author assumes NO responsibility for how anyone uses it.
If netcat makes you rich somehow and you're feeling generous, mail me a
check. If you are affiliated in any way with Microsoft Network, get a
life. Always ski in control. Comments, questions, and patches to
hobbit@avian.org.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Some port names in /etc/services contain hyphens -- netcat currently
will not correctly parse those unless you escape the hyphens with
backslashes (e.g. "netcat localhost 'ftp\-data'").</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Efforts have been made to have netcat "do the right thing" in all its
various modes. If you believe that it is doing the wrong thing under
whatever circumstances, please notify me and tell me how you think it
should behave. If netcat is not able to do some task you think up, minor
tweaks to the code will probably fix that. It provides a basic and
easily-modified template for writing other network applications, and I
certainly encourage people to make custom mods and send in any
improvements they make to it. Continued feedback from the Internet
community is always welcome!</p>
