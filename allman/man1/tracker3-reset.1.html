<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>tracker3-reset - Reset the index and configuration</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>tracker3 reset</strong> [--filesystem | --rss] [--file
<em>FILE</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The reset command will change either your configuration or index
irreversibly and should be used with care. Other than tags, actual data
(e.g. files) should not be affected by this command.</p>
<p>The "index" is a link between your content (either locally or
remotely) and how it can be found quickly using a number of different
queries. Under the hood, this is done using a database.</p>
<p>Removing all data and starting again from the beginning with an empty
data set (which is a common use of this command) is done by using the
hard reset option. This behaves as if Tracker was just installed.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-s, --filesystem</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removes data stored by tracker-miner-fs(1). The miner will
automatically recreate its cache from the filesystem when it
restarts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-r, --rss</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removes data stored by tracker-miner-rss(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-f, --file</strong> <em>FILE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resets all indexed information about <em>FILE</em>, works recursively
for directories. Nothing will be done if <em>FILE</em> is not currently
indexed. After deletion, a request to reindex this data will be
immediately issued.</p>
