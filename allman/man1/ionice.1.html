[<strong>-n</strong> <em>level</em>] [<strong>-t</strong>]
<em>command</em> [argument] ...</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This program sets or gets the I/O scheduling class and priority for a
program. If no arguments or just <strong>-p</strong> is given,
<strong>ionice</strong> will query the current I/O scheduling class and
priority for that process.</p>
<p>When <em>command</em> is given, <strong>ionice</strong> will run this
command with the given arguments. If no <em>class</em> is specified,
then <em>command</em> will be executed with the "best-effort" scheduling
class. The default priority level is 4.</p>
<p>As of this writing, a process can be in one of three scheduling
classes:</p>
<p><strong>Idle</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A program running with idle I/O priority will only get disk time when
no other program has asked for disk I/O for a defined grace period. The
impact of an idle I/O process on normal system activity should be zero.
This scheduling class does not take a priority argument. Presently, this
scheduling class is permitted for an ordinary user (since kernel
2.6.25).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Best-effort</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the effective scheduling class for any process that has not
asked for a specific I/O priority. This class takes a priority argument
from <em>0-7</em>, with a lower number being higher priority. Programs
running at the same best-effort priority are served in a round-robin
fashion.</p>
<p>Note that before kernel 2.6.26 a process that has not asked for an
I/O priority formally uses "<strong>none</strong>" as scheduling class,
but the I/O scheduler will treat such processes as if it were in the
best-effort class. The priority within the best-effort class will be
dynamically derived from the CPU nice level of the process: io_priority
= (cpu_nice + 20) / 5.</p>
<p>For kernels after 2.6.26 with the CFQ I/O scheduler, a process that
has not asked for an I/O priority inherits its CPU scheduling class. The
I/O priority is derived from the CPU nice level of the process (same as
before kernel 2.6.26).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Realtime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RT scheduling class is given first access to the disk, regardless
of what else is going on in the system. Thus the RT class needs to be
used with some care, as it can starve other processes. As with the
best-effort class, 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time
slice a given process will receive on each scheduling window. This
scheduling class is not permitted for an ordinary (i.e., non-root)
user.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--class</strong> <em>class</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the name or number of the scheduling class to use;
<code>0</code> for none, <code>1</code> for realtime, <code>2</code> for
best-effort, <code>3</code> for idle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--classdata</strong> <em>level</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the scheduling class data. This only has an effect if the
class accepts an argument. For realtime and best-effort, <em>0-7</em>
are valid data (priority levels), and <code>0</code> represents the
highest priority level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-p</strong>, <strong>--pid</strong> <em>PID</em>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the process IDs of running processes for which to get or set
the scheduling parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-P</strong>, <strong>--pgid</strong> <em>PGID</em>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the process group IDs of running processes for which to get
or set the scheduling parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-t</strong>, <strong>--ignore</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore failure to set the requested priority. If <em>command</em> was
specified, run it even in case it was not possible to set the desired
scheduling priority, which can happen due to insufficient privileges or
an old kernel version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-u</strong>, <strong>--uid</strong> <em>UID</em>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the user IDs of running processes for which to get or set the
scheduling parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print version and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Linux supports I/O scheduling priorities and classes since 2.6.13
with the CFQ I/O scheduler.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p># <strong>ionice</strong> -c 3 -p 89</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sets process with PID 89 as an idle I/O process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p># <strong>ionice</strong> -c 2 -n 0 bash</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Runs 'bash' as a best-effort program with highest priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p># <strong>ionice</strong> -p 89 91</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prints the class and priority of the processes with PID 89 and
91.</p>
