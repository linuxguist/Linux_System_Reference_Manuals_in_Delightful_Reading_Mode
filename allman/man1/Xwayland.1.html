<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Xwayland - an X server for running X clients under Wayland.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>Xwayland</strong> [option ...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Xwayland</em> is an X server and a Wayland client. It plays the
role of a proxy between legacy X clients which do not support the
Wayland protocols and the Wayland server.</p>
<p>Usually, <em>Xwayland</em> is spawned automatically by the Wayland
server and runs rootless so that X clients integrate seamlessly with the
rest of the Wayland desktop. It is however possible for a user to launch
Xwayland non-rootless, mainly for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Like all of the X servers, <em>Xwayland</em> accepts the command line
options described in the <em>Xserver</em>(7) manual page. The following
additional arguments are supported as well.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-eglstream</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use EGLStream backend for NVidia GPUs. If <em>Xwayland</em> was
compiled with EGLStream support, this option will instruct
<em>Xwayland</em> to try that backend first, then fallback to the GBM
backend if EGLStream is not supported by the Wayland server. Without
this option, <em>Xwayland</em> tries the GBM backend first, and fallback
to EGLStream if GBM is not usable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-initfd <em>fd</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add the given <em>fd</em> as a listen socket for initialization of X
clients. This options is aimed at <em>Wayland</em> servers which run
<em>Xwayland</em> on-demand, to be able to spawn specific X clients
which need to complete before other regular X clients can connect to
<em>Xwayland</em>, like <em>xrdb</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-listen <em>fd</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>deprecated, use <em>-listenfd</em> instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-listenfd <em>fd\fP</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add given fd as a listen socket. This option is used by the
<em>Wayland</em> server to pass <em>Xwayland the socket where X clients
connect.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-noTouchPointerEmulation</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable touch pointer emulation. This allows the Wayland compositor
to implement its own pointer emulation mechanism for X11 clients that
don't support touch input.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-rootless</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run <em>Xwayland rootless, so that X clients integrate seamlessly
with</em> Wayland clients in a Wayland desktop. That requires the
Wayland server to be an X window manager as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-shm</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Force the shared memory backend instead of glamor (if available) for
passing buffers to the Wayland server.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-verbose</strong> [<em>n]</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the verbosity level for information printed on stderr. If the
<em>n</em> value isn't supplied, each occurrence of this option
increments the verbosity level. When the <em>n</em> value is supplied,
the verbosity level is set to that value. The default verbosity level is
0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Show the server version and exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-wm <em>fd</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used by the <em>Wayland server to pass Xwayland</em>
the socket where the X window manager client connects, when
<em>Xwayland</em> is running with <em>-rootless.</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>the name of the display of the Wayland server.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XWAYLAND_NO_GLAMOR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>disable glamor and DRI3 support in <em>Xwayland, for testing
purposes.</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
