<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>psfaddtable - add a Unicode character table to a console font</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>psfaddtable</strong> <em>fontfile tablefile outfile</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>psfaddtable</strong> takes a console font in .psf format
given by <em>fontfile</em> and merges it with the Unicode character
table given by <em>tablefile</em> to produce a font file with an
embedded character table, which is written to <em>outfile</em>. An input
file name of "-" denotes standard input, and an output file name of "-"
denotes standard output. If the <em>fontfile</em> already contains an
embedded character table, it is ignored.</p>
<h1>TABLE FILE FORMAT</h1>
<p>Each line in the <em>tablefile</em> should be either blank, contain a
comment (preceded by <em>#</em>), or contain a sequence of numbers in
either decimal (default), octal (preceded by <em>0</em>), or hexadecimal
(preceded by <em>0x</em>) format, separated by spaces or tabs. The first
number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the font that is being
referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff for a 256-character font and 0
and 0x1ff for a 512-character font. Any subsequent numbers on the same
line are Unicodes matched by this specific glyph slot. Instead of a
single Unicode one may have a sequence of Unicodes separates by commas,
to denote that the glyph depicts the corresponding composed symbol. It
is permissible to have multiple lines for the same glyph.</p>
