<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>lwp-download - Fetch large files from the web</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>lwp-download [-a] [-s] &lt;url&gt; [&lt;local path&gt;] Options: -a
save the file in ASCII mode -s use HTTP headers to guess output
filename</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>lwp-download</strong> program will save the file at
<em>url</em> to a local file.</p>
<p>If <em>local path</em> is not specified, then the current directory
is assumed.</p>
<p>If <em>local path</em> is a directory, then the last segment of the
path of the <em>url</em> is appended to form a local filename. If the
<em>url</em> path ends with slash the name index is used. With the
<strong>-s</strong> option pick up the last segment of the filename from
server provided sources like the Content-Disposition header or any
redirect URLs. A file extension to match the server reported
Content-Type might also be appended. If a file with the produced
filename already exists, then <strong>lwp-download</strong> will prompt
before it overwrites and will fail if its standard input is not a
terminal. This form of invocation will also fail is no acceptable
filename can be derived from the sources mentioned above.</p>
<p>If <em>local path</em> is not a directory, then it is simply used as
the path to save into. If the file already exists it's overwritten.</p>
<p>The <em>lwp-download</em> program is implemented using the
<em>libwww-perl</em> library. It is better suited to down load big files
than the <em>lwp-request</em> program because it does not store the file
in memory. Another benefit is that it will keep you updated about its
progress and that you don't have much options to worry about.</p>
<p>Use the <code>-a</code> option to save the file in text (ASCII) mode.
Might make a difference on DOSish systems.</p>
