<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>xwininfo - window information utility for X</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>xwininfo</strong> [-help] [-id <em>wdid</em>] [-root] [-name
<em>wdname</em>] [-int] [-children] [-tree] [-stats] [-bits] [-events]
[-size] [-wm] [-shape] [-frame] [-all] [-english] [-metric] [-display
<em>host:dpy</em>] [-version]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Xwininfo</em> is a utility for displaying information about
windows. Various information is displayed depending on which options are
selected. If no options are chosen, <strong>-stats</strong> is
assumed.</p>
<p>The user has the option of selecting the target window with the mouse
(by clicking any mouse button in the desired window) or by specifying
its window id on the command line with the <strong>-id</strong> option.
Or instead of specifying the window by its id number, the
<strong>-name</strong> option may be used to specify which window is
desired by name. There is also a special <strong>-root</strong> option
to quickly obtain information on the screen's root window.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-id <em>wdid</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option allows the user to specify a target window <em>wdid</em>
on the command line rather than using the mouse to select the target
window. This is very useful in debugging X applications where the target
window is not mapped to the screen or where the use of the mouse might
be impossible or interfere with the application.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-name <em>wdname</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option allows the user to specify that the window named
<em>wdname</em> is the target window on the command line rather than
using the mouse to select the target window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-root</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies that X's root window is the target window. This
is useful in situations where the root window is completely
obscured.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-int</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies that all X window ids should be displayed as
integer values. The default is to display them as hexadecimal
values.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-children</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes the root, parent, and children windows' ids and
names of the selected window to be displayed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-tree</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is like <strong>-children</strong> but displays all
children recursively.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-stats</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes the display of various attributes pertaining to
the location and appearance of the selected window. Information
displayed includes the location of the window, its width and height, its
depth, border width, visual id and class, colormap id if any, map state,
backing-store hint, and location of the corners.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-bits</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes the display of various attributes pertaining to
the selected window's raw bits and how the selected window is to be
stored. Displayed information includes the selected window's bit
gravity, window gravity, backing-store hint, backing-planes value,
backing pixel, and whether or not the window has save-under set.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-events</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes the selected window's event masks to be displayed.
Both the event mask of events wanted by some client and the event mask
of events not to propagate are displayed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-size</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes the selected window's sizing hints to be
displayed. Displayed information includes: for both the normal size
hints and the zoom size hints, the user supplied location if any; the
program supplied location if any; the user supplied size if any; the
program supplied size if any; the minimum size if any; the maximum size
if any; the resize increments if any; and the minimum and maximum aspect
ratios if any.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-wm</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes the selected window's window manager hints to be
displayed. Information displayed may include whether or not the
application accepts input, what the window's icon window # and name is,
where the window's icon should go, and what the window's initial state
should be.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-shape</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes the selected window's window and border shape
extents to be displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-frame</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes window manager frames to be considered when
manually selecting windows.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-metric</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes all individual height, width, and x and y
positions to be displayed in millimeters as well as number of pixels,
based on what the server thinks the resolution is. Geometry
specifications that are in <strong>+x+y</strong> form are not
changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-english</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option causes all individual height, width, and x and y
positions to be displayed in inches (and feet, yards, and miles if
necessary) as well as number of pixels. <strong>-metric</strong> and
<strong>-english</strong> may both be enabled at the same time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-all</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is a quick way to ask for all information possible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-d, -display <em>host:dpy</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
<em>X(7)</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that <em>xwininfo</em> should print its version
information and exit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>The following is a sample summary taken with no options
specified:</p>
<p>xwininfo: Window id: 0x60000f "xterm"</p>

upper-left X: 0 Relative upper-left Y: 25 Width: 579 Height: 316 Depth:

<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>DISPLAY</strong></dt>

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Using <strong>-stats -bits</strong> shows some redundant
information.</p>
<p>The <strong>-geometry</strong> string displayed must make assumptions
about the window's border width and the behavior of the application and
the window manager. As a result, the location given is not always
correct.</p>
