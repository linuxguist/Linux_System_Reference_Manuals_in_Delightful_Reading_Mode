<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>im-launch - launch input method and execute session program</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>im-launch <em>SESSION-PROGRAM</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>im-launch</strong> command is used to start a input
method framework server daemon such as <strong>ibus-daemon</strong>, set
up the appropriate environment variables for the client programs, and
execute <em>SESSION-PROGRAM</em> such as
<strong>x-session-manager</strong>.</p>
<p>This command is usually not invoked from the console of a normal user
but is normally invoked by the
<strong>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-config_launch</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>TROUBLESHOOT</h1>
<p>If you have any problem, see the first part of
<strong>~/.xsession-errors</strong> and look for the cause. If you are
running <strong>im-config</strong> while Debian (sid) system is
undergoing a major library transition, you may need to manually set up
<strong>~/.xinputrc</strong> with adjusted library version number etc.
Please file a bug report to the im-config package using reportbug(1)
describing your resolution experience.</p>
