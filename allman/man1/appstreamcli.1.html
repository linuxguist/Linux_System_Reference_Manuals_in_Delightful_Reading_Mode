<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>appstreamcli - Handle AppStream metadata formats and query AppStream
data</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>appstreamcli</strong> [<strong>COMMAND</strong>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This manual page documents briefly the <strong>appstreamcli</strong>
command.</p>
<p><strong>appstreamcli</strong> is a small helper tool to work with
AppStream metadata and access the AppStream component index from the
command-line. The AppStream component index contains a list of all
available software components for your distribution, matched to their
package names. It is generated using AppStream XML or Debian DEP-11
data, which is provided by your distributor.</p>
<p>For more information about the AppStream project and the other
components which are part of it, take a look at the AppStream pages at
<strong>Freedesktop.org</strong>[1].</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>get</strong> <em>ID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get a component from the metadata pool by its identifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>s</strong>, <strong>search</strong> <em>TERM</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Search the AppStream component pool for a given search term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>what-provides</strong> <em>TYPE</em> <strong></strong>
<em>TERM</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return components which provide a given item. An item type can be
specified using the <em>TYPE</em> parameter, a value to search for has
to be supplied using the <em>TERM</em> parameter.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Get components which handle the "text/xml" mediatype.</p>
<p><strong>appstreamcli</strong> what-provides mediatype "text/xml"</p>
<p>Get component which provides the "libfoo.so.2" library.</p>
<p><strong>appstreamcli</strong> what-provides lib libfoo.so.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>refresh</strong>, <strong>refresh-cache</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trigger a database refresh, if necessary. In case you want to force
the database to be rebuilt, supply the <strong>--force</strong>
flag.</p>
<p>This command must be executed with root permission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>status</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display various information about the installed metadata and the
metadata cache.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>os-info</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show information about the current operating system from the metadata
index. This requires the operating system to provide a operating-system
component for itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>dump</strong> <em>ID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dump the complete XML descriptions of components with the given ID
that were found in the metadata pool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>validate</strong> <em>FILES</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Validate AppStream XML metadata for compliance with the
specification.</p>
<p>Both XML metadata types, upstream and distro XML, are handled. The
format type which should be validated is determined automatically.</p>
<p>The <strong>--pedantic</strong> flag triggers a more pedantic
validation of the file, including minor and style issues in the
report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>validate-tree</strong> <em>DIRECTORY</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Validate AppStream XML metadata found in a file-tree.</p>
<p>This performs a standard validation of all found metadata, but also
checks for additional errors, like the presence of .desktop files and
validity of other additional metadata.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>check-license</strong> <em>LICENSE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test a license string or license expression for validity and display
details about it.</p>
<p>This will check whether the license string is considered to be valid
for AppStream, and return a non-zero exit code if it is not. The command
will also display useful information like the canonical ID of a license,
whether it is suitable as license for AppStream metadata, and whether
the license is considered to be for Free and Open Source software or
proprietary software.</p>
<p>AppStream will consider any license as Free and Open Source that is
marked as suitable by either the Free Software Foundation (FSF), Open
Source Initiative (OSI) or explicit license list of the Debian Free
Software Guidelines (DFSG).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>install</strong> <em>ID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Install a software component by its ID using the package manager or
Flatpak.</p>
<p>This resolves the AppStream component ID to an installation candidate
and then calls either the native package manager or Flatpak (if
available) to install the component.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>remove</strong> <em>ID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uninstall a software component by its ID using the package manager or
Flatpak.</p>
<p>This will uninstall software matching the selected ID using either
the native package manager or Flatpak (if available).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>put</strong> <em>FILE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Install a metadata file into the right directory on the current
machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>compare-versions</strong>, <strong>vercmp</strong>
<em>VER1</em> <strong></strong> <em>[CMP]</em> <strong></strong>
<em>VER2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compare two version numbers. If two version numbers are given as
parameters, the versions will be compared and the comparison result will
be printed to stdout.</p>
<p>If a version number, a comparison operator and another version number
are passed in as parameter, the result of the comparison operation will
be printed to stdout, and <strong>appstreamcli</strong> will exit with a
non-zero exit status in case the comparison failed. The comparison
operator can be one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>eq - Equal to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>ne - Not equal to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>lt - Less than</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>gt - Greater than</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>le - Less than or equal to</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>ge - Greater than or equal to</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>new-template</strong> <em>TYPE</em> <strong></strong>
<em>FILE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a metainfo file template to be used by software projects. The
<strong>--from-desktop</strong> option can be used to use a .desktop
file as template for generating the example file.</p>
<p>The generated files contain example entries which need to be filed in
with the actual desired values by the project author.</p>
<p>The first <em>TYPE</em> parameter is the name of an AppStream
component type. For a complete list check out <strong>the
documentation</strong>[2] or the help output of
<strong>appstreamcli</strong> for this subcommand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>make-desktop-file</strong> <em>MI_FILE</em> <strong></strong>
<em>DESKTOP_FILE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a XDG desktop-entry file from a metainfo file. If the
desktop-entry file specified in <em>DESKTOP_FILE</em> already exists, it
will get extended with the new information extracted from the metainfo
file. Otherwise a new file will be created.</p>
<p>This command will use the first binary mentioned in a provides tag of
the component for the Exec= field of the new desktop-entry file. If this
is not the desired behavior, the <strong>--exec</strong> flag can be
used to explicitly define a binary to launch. Other methods of launching
the application are currently not supported.</p>
<p>In order to generate a proper desktop-entry, this command assumes
that not only the minimally required tags for an AppStream component are
set, but also that it has an &lt;icon/&gt; tag of type "stock" to
describe the stock icon that should be used as well as a
&lt;categories/&gt; tag containing the categories the application should
be placed in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>news-to-metainfo</strong> <em>NEWS_FILE</em>
<strong></strong> <em>MI_FILE</em> <strong></strong>
<em>[OUT_FILE]</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This command converts a NEWS file as used by many open source
projects into the XML used by AppStream. Since NEWS files are free text,
a lot of heuristics will be applied to get reasonable results. The
converter can also read a YAML version of the AppStream release
description and convert it to XML as well. If the metainfo file
<em>MI_FILE</em> already exists, it will be augmented with the new
release entries, otherwise the release entries will be written without
any wrapping component. If <em>[OUT_FILE]</em> is specified, instead of
acting on <em>MI_FILE</em> the changed data will be written to the
particular file. If any of the output filenames is set to "-", the
output will instead be written to stdout.</p>
<p>The <strong>--format</strong> option can be used to enforce reading
the input file in a specific format ("text" or "yaml") in case the
format autodetection fails. The <strong>--limit</strong> option is used
to limit the amount of release entries written (the newest entries will
always be first).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>metainfo-to-news</strong> <em>MI_FILE</em> <strong></strong>
<em>NEWS_FILE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This command reverses the <strong>news-to-metainfo</strong> command
and writes a NEWS file as text or YAML using the XML contained in a
metainfo file. If <em>NEWS_FILE</em> is set to "-", the resulting data
will be written to stdout instead of to a file.</p>
<p>The <strong>--format</strong> option can be used to explicitly
specify the output format ("yaml" or "text"). If it is not set,
<strong>appstreamcli</strong> will guess which format is most
suitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>convert</strong> <em>FILE1</em> <strong></strong>
<em>FILE1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Converts AppStream XML metadata into its YAML representation and vice
versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>compose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Composes an AppStream metadata catalog from a directory tree with
metainfo files. This command is only available if the
org.freedesktop.appstream.compose component is installed. See
<strong>appstreamcli-compose</strong>(1) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--details</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print out more information about a found component.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-color</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dont print colored output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-net</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not access the network when validating metadata.</p>
<p>The same effect can be achieved by setting the
<strong>AS_VALIDATE_NONET</strong> environment variable before running
<strong>appstreamcli</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display the version number of appstreamcli</p>
