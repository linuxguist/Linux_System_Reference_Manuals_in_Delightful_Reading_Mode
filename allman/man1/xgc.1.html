<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>xgc - X graphics demo</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>xgc</strong> [-<em>toolkitoption</em> ...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>xgc</em> program demonstrates various features of the X
graphics primitives. In X, most of the details about the graphics to be
generated are stored in a resource called a graphics context (GC). The
<strong>xgc</strong> program provides a user interface for setting
various GC components. Pressing the "Run" button causes these results to
be displayed in the large drawing window on the right. Timing
information is displayed in the window immediately below.</p>
<p>The items in the upper left hand window work as follows:</p>
<p><em>Function</em> - specify the logical function with which
primitives will drawn. The most usual setting is "set", i.e. simply to
render pixels without regard to what has been drawn before.</p>
<p><em>LineStyle</em> - specify whether lines should be drawn solid in
foreground, dashed in foreground or alternating foreground and
background.</p>
<p><em>CapStyle</em> - specify the appearance of the ends of a line.</p>
<p><em>JoinStyle</em> - specify the appearance of joints between
consecutive lines drawn within a single graphics primitive.</p>
<p><em>FillStyle</em> - specify whether lines, text and fill requests
are solid, tiled with a pixmap or stippled.</p>
<p><em>FillRule</em> - specifies the rule used to fill polygons. The
EvenOdd rule means that if areas overlap an odd number of times, they
are not drawn. Winding rule means that overlapping areas are always
filled, regardless of how many times they overlap.</p>
<p><em>ArcMode</em> - specifies the rule for filling of arcs. The
boundary of the arc is either a Chord or two radii.</p>
<p><em>planemask</em> - specifies which planes of the drawing window are
modified. By default, all planes are modified.</p>
<p><em>dashlist</em> - specifies a pattern to be used when drawing
dashed lines.</p>
<p><em>Line Width</em> - specifies the width in pixels of lines to be
drawn. Zero means to draw using the server's fastest algorithm with a
line width of one pixel.</p>
<p><em>Font</em> - specifies the font to be used for text
primitives.</p>
<p><em>Foreground</em> and <em>Background</em> - specify the pixel
values to be applied when drawing primitives. The Foreground value is
used as the pixel value for set bits in the source in all primitives.
The Background value is used as the pixel value for unset bits in the
source when using Copy Plane, drawing lines with LineStyle of DoubleDash
and filling with FillStyle of OpaqueStippled.</p>
<p><em>Percentage of Test</em> - scrollbar permits specifying only a
percentage of the test to be run. The number at the left indicates the
current setting, which defaults to 100%.</p>
<p>The window labeled "Test" permits choice of one a number of graphics
primitive tests, including Points, Segments, Lines, Arcs and Filled
Arcs, 8-bit Text and Image Text, Rectangles and Filled Rectangles, Image
draws, as well as Copy Plane and Copy Area.</p>
<p>The window to the right of this has buttons which permit
record/playback of the primitives rendered.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><em>Xgc</em> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
options.</p>
<h1>X DEFAULTS</h1>
<p>This program accepts the usual defaults for toolkit applications.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>DISPLAY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>to get the default host and display number.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XENVIRONMENT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global
resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p>X(7)</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>This program isn't really finished yet, but it probably never will
be, since it only demonstrates the original X11 core protocol rendering
operations, which few modern programs use anymore.</p>
