<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>vimdiff - edit between two and eight versions of a file with Vim and
show differences</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><br />
<strong>vimdiff</strong> [options] file1 file2 [file3 [file4 [file5
[file6 [file7 [file8]]]]]]</p>
<p><strong>gvimdiff</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Vimdiff</strong> starts <strong>Vim</strong> on two up to
eight files. Each file gets its own window. The differences between the
files are highlighted. This is a nice way to inspect changes and to move
changes from one version to another version of the same file.</p>
<p>See vim(1) for details about Vim itself.</p>
<p>When started as <strong>gvimdiff</strong> the GUI will be started, if
available.</p>
<p>In each window the 'diff' option will be set, which causes the
differences to be highlighted.<br />
The 'wrap' and 'scrollbind' options are set to make the text look
good.<br />
The 'foldmethod' option is set to "diff", which puts ranges of lines
without changes in a fold. 'foldcolumn' is set to two to make it easy to
spot the folds and open or close them.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Vertical splits are used to align the lines, as if the "-O" argument
was used. To use horizontal splits instead, use the "-o" argument.</p>
<p>For all other arguments see vim(1).</p>

<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
<p>Most of <strong>Vim</strong> was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot
of help from others. See ":help credits" in <strong>Vim.</strong></p>
