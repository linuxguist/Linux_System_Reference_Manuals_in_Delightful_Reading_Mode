<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>gzip</strong> [<strong> -acdfhklLnNrtvV19 </strong>]
[<strong>-S suffix</strong>] [ <em>name ...</em> ]</p>
<p><br />
<strong>gunzip</strong> [<strong> -acfhklLnNrtvV </strong>] [<strong>-S
suffix</strong>] [ <em>name ...</em> ]<br />
<strong>zcat</strong> [<strong> -fhLV </strong>] [ <em>name ...</em>
]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>gzip</strong> command reduces the size of the named files
using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file is replaced
by one with the extension <strong>.gz</strong>, while keeping the same
ownership modes, access and modification times. (The default extension
is <strong>z</strong> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.) If
no files are specified, or if a file name is "-", the standard input is
compressed to the standard output. The <strong>gzip</strong> command
will only attempt to compress regular files. In particular, it will
ignore symbolic links.</p>
<p>If the compressed file name is too long for its file system,
<strong>gzip</strong> truncates it. The <strong>gzip</strong> command
attempts to truncate only the parts of the file name longer than 3
characters. (A part is delimited by dots.) If the name consists of small
parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For example, if file names
are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to
gzi.msd.exe.gz. Names are not truncated on systems which do not have a
limit on file name length.</p>
<p>By default, <strong>gzip</strong> keeps the original file name and
timestamp in the compressed file. These are used when decompressing the
file with the <strong>-N</strong> option. This is useful when the
compressed file name was truncated or when the timestamp was not
preserved after a file transfer.</p>
<p>Compressed files can be restored to their original form using
<strong>gzip -d</strong> or <strong>gunzip</strong> or
<strong>zcat</strong>. If the original name saved in the compressed file
is not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the
original one to make it legal.</p>
<p><strong>gunzip</strong> takes a list of files on its command line and
replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z
(ignoring case) and which begins with the correct magic number with an
uncompressed file without the original extension.
<strong>gunzip</strong> also recognizes the special extensions
<strong>.tgz</strong> and <strong>.taz</strong> as shorthands for
<strong>.tar.gz</strong> and <strong>.tar.Z</strong> respectively. When
compressing, <strong>gzip</strong> uses the <strong>.tgz</strong>
extension if necessary instead of truncating a file with a
<strong>.tar</strong> extension.</p>
<p><strong>gunzip</strong> can currently decompress files created by
<strong>gzip</strong>, <strong>zip</strong>, <strong>compress</strong>,
<strong>compress -H</strong> or <strong>pack</strong>. The detection of
the input format is automatic. When using the first two formats,
<strong>gunzip</strong> checks a 32 bit CRC. For <strong>pack</strong>
and <strong>gunzip</strong> checks the uncompressed length. The standard
<strong>compress</strong> format was not designed to allow consistency
checks. However <strong>gunzip</strong> is sometimes able to detect a
bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a .Z file, do not
assume that the .Z file is correct simply because the standard
<strong>uncompress</strong> does not complain. This generally means that
the standard <strong>uncompress</strong> does not check its input, and
happily generates garbage output. The SCO compress -H format (lzh
compression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some
consistency checks.</p>
<p>Files created by <strong>zip</strong> can be uncompressed by gzip
only if they have a single member compressed with the 'deflation'
method. This feature is only intended to help conversion of tar.zip
files to the tar.gz format. To extract a <strong>zip</strong> file with
a single member, use a command like '<strong>gunzip
&lt;foo.zip</strong>' or '<strong>gunzip -S .zip foo.zip</strong>'. To
extract zip files with several members, use <strong>unzip</strong>
instead of <strong>gunzip</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>zcat</strong> command is identical to
<strong>gunzip</strong> <strong>-c</strong>. (On some systems,
<strong>zcat</strong> may be installed as <strong>gzcat</strong> to
preserve the original link to <strong>compress</strong>.)
<strong>zcat</strong> uncompresses either a list of files on the command
line or its standard input and writes the uncompressed data on standard
output. <strong>zcat</strong> will uncompress files that have the
correct magic number whether they have a <strong>.gz</strong> suffix or
not.</p>
<p>The <strong>gzip</strong> command uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used
in <strong>zip</strong> and PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained
depends on the size of the input and the distribution of common
substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by
60-70%. Compression is generally much better than that achieved by LZW
(as used in <strong>compress</strong>), Huffman coding (as used in
<strong>pack</strong>), or adaptive Huffman coding
(<strong>compact</strong>).</p>
<p>Compression is always performed, even if the compressed file is
slightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few
bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes per 32 KiB block, or an
expansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. The actual number of used
disk blocks almost never increases.</p>
<p><strong>gzip</strong> normally preserves the mode and modification
timestamp of a file when compressing or decompressing. If you have
appropriate privileges, it also preserves the file's owner and
group.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-a --ascii</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using local conventions. This
option is supported only on some non-Unix systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is
converted to LF when compressing, and LF is converted to CR LF when
decompressing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-c --stdout --to-stdout</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write output on standard output; keep original files unchanged. If
there are several input files, the output consists of a sequence of
independently compressed members. To obtain better compression,
concatenate all input files before compressing them.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d --decompress --uncompress</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Decompress.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-f --force</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple
links or the corresponding file already exists, or if the compressed
data is read from or written to a terminal. If the input data is not in
a format recognized by <strong>gzip</strong>, and if the option --stdout
is also given, copy the input data without change to the standard
output: let <strong>zcat</strong> behave as <strong>cat</strong>. If
<strong>-f</strong> is not given, and when not running in the
background, <strong>gzip</strong> prompts to verify whether an existing
file should be overwritten.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-h --help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display a help screen and quit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-k --keep</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Keep (don't delete) input files during compression or
decompression.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-l --list</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>For each compressed file, list the following fields:</p>
<p>compressed size: size of the compressed file uncompressed size: size
of the uncompressed file ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file</p>
<p>The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in gzip format,
such as compressed .Z files. To get the uncompressed size for such a
file, you can use:</p>
<p>zcat file.Z | wc -c</p>
<p>In combination with the --verbose option, the following fields are
also displayed:</p>
<p>method: compression method crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed
data date &amp; time: timestamp for the uncompressed file</p>
<p>The compression methods currently supported are deflate, compress,
lzh (SCO compress -H) and pack. The crc is given as ffffffff for a file
not in gzip format.</p>
<p>With --name, the uncompressed name, date and time are those stored
within the compress file if present.</p>
<p>With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio for all files
is also displayed, unless some sizes are unknown. With --quiet, the
title and totals lines are not displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-L --license</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display the <strong>gzip</strong> license and quit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-n --no-name</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When compressing, do not save the original file name and timestamp by
default. (The original name is always saved if the name had to be
truncated.) When decompressing, do not restore the original file name if
present (remove only the <strong>gzip</strong> suffix from the
compressed file name) and do not restore the original timestamp if
present (copy it from the compressed file). This option is the default
when decompressing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-N --name</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When compressing, always save the original file name, and save the
seconds part of the original modification timestamp if the original is a
regular file and its timestamp is at least 1 (1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC)
and is less than 2**32 (2106-02-07 06:28:16 UTC, assuming leap seconds
are not counted); this is the default. When decompressing, restore from
the saved file name and timestamp if present. This option is useful on
systems which have a limit on file name length or when the timestamp has
been lost after a file transfer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-q --quiet</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Suppress all warnings.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-r --recursive</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names
specified on the command line are directories, <strong>gzip</strong>
will descend into the directory and compress all the files it finds
there (or decompress them in the case of <strong>gunzip</strong> ).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-S .suf --suffix .suf</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When compressing, use suffix .suf instead of .gz. Any non-empty
suffix can be given, but suffixes other than .z and .gz should be
avoided to avoid confusion when files are transferred to other
systems.</p>
<p>When decompressing, add .suf to the beginning of the list of suffixes
to try, when deriving an output file name from an input file name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--synchronous</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use synchronous output. With this option, <strong>gzip</strong> is
less likely to lose data during a system crash, but it can be
considerably slower.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-t --test</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Test. Check the compressed file integrity then quit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v --verbose</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file
compressed or decompressed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V --version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Version. Display the version number and compilation options then
quit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-# --fast --best</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit
<strong>#</strong>, where <strong>-1</strong> or <strong>--fast</strong>
indicates the fastest compression method (less compression) and
<strong>-9</strong> or <strong>--best</strong> indicates the slowest
compression method (best compression). The default compression level is
<strong>-6</strong> (that is, biased towards high compression at expense
of speed).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--rsyncable</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When you synchronize a compressed file between two computers, this
option allows rsync to transfer only files that were changed in the
archive instead of the entire archive. Normally, after a change is made
to any file in the archive, the compression algorithm can generate a new
version of the archive that does not match the previous version of the
archive. In this case, rsync transfers the entire new version of the
archive to the remote computer. With this option, rsync can transfer
only the changed files as well as a small amount of metadata that is
required to update the archive structure in the area that was
changed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ADVANCED USAGE</h1>
<p>Multiple compressed files can be concatenated. In this case,
<strong>gunzip</strong> will extract all members at once. For
example:</p>
<p>gzip -c file1 &gt; foo.gz gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>gunzip -c foo</p>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<p>cat file1 file2</p>
<p>In case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can
still be recovered (if the damaged member is removed). However, you can
get better compression by compressing all members at once:</p>
<p>cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz</p>
<p>compresses better than</p>
<p>gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz</p>
<p>If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better
compression, do:</p>
<p>gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz</p>
<p>If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed
size and CRC reported by the --list option applies to the last member
only. If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you can
use:</p>
<p>gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c</p>
<p>If you wish to create a single archive file with multiple members so
that members can later be extracted independently, use an archiver such
as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke gzip
transparently. gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a
replacement.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>The obsolescent environment variable <strong>GZIP</strong> can hold a
set of default options for <strong>gzip</strong>. These options are
interpreted first and can be overwritten by explicit command line
parameters. As this can cause problems when using scripts, this feature
is supported only for options that are reasonably likely to not cause
too much harm, and <strong>gzip</strong> warns if it is used. This
feature will be removed in a future release of
<strong>gzip</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use an alias or script instead. For example, if
<strong>gzip</strong> is in the directory <strong>/usr/bin</strong> you
can prepend <strong>$HOME/bin</strong> to your <strong>PATH</strong> and
create an executable script <strong>$HOME/bin/gzip</strong> containing
the following:</p>
<p>#! /bin/sh export PATH=/usr/bin exec gzip -9 "$@"</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>When writing compressed data to a tape, it is generally necessary to
pad the output with zeroes up to a block boundary. When the data is read
and the whole block is passed to <strong>gunzip</strong> for
decompression, <strong>gunzip</strong> detects that there is extra
trailing garbage after the compressed data and emits a warning by
default. You can use the --quiet option to suppress the warning.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>In some rare cases, the --best option gives worse compression than
the default compression level (-6). On some highly redundant files,
<strong>compress</strong> compresses better than
<strong>gzip</strong>.</p>
