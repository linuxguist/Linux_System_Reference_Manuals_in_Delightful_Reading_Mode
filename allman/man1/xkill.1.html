<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>xkill - kill a client by its X resource</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>xkill</strong> [-display <em>displayname</em>] [-id
<em>resource</em>] [-button number] [-frame] [-all] [-version]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Xkill</em> is a utility for forcing the X server to close
connections to clients. This program is very dangerous, but is useful
for aborting programs that have displayed undesired windows on a user's
screen. If no resource identifier is given with <em>-id</em>,
<em>xkill</em> will display a special cursor as a prompt for the user to
select a window to be killed. If a pointer button is pressed over a
non-root window, the server will close its connection to the client that
created the window.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-display <em>displayname</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the name of the X server to contact.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-id <em>resource</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the X identifier for the resource whose creator
is to be aborted. If no resource is specified, <em>xkill</em> will
display a special cursor with which you should select a window to be
kill.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-button <em>number</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the number of pointer button that should be
used in selecting a window to kill. If the word "any" is specified, any
button on the pointer may be used. By default, the first button in the
pointer map (which is usually the leftmost button) is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-all</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that all clients with top-level windows on the
screen should be killed. <em>Xkill</em> will ask you to select the root
window with each of the currently defined buttons to give you several
chances to abort. Use of this option is highly discouraged.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-frame</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that xkill should ignore the standard
conventions for finding top-level client windows (which are typically
nested inside a window manager window), and simply believe that you want
to kill direct children of the root.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option makes xkill print its version and exit without killing
anything.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>This command does not provide any warranty that the application whose
connection to the X server is closed will abort nicely, or even abort at
all. All this command does is to close the connection to the X server.
Many existing applications do indeed abort when their connection to the
X server is closed, but some can choose to continue.</p>
<h1>XDEFAULTS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Button</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a specific pointer button number or the word "any" to use
when selecting windows.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
