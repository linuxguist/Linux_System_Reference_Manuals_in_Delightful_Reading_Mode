<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>cheese - tool to take pictures and videos from your webcam</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>cheese</strong> [option...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>cheese</strong> uses your webcam to take photos and videos,
applies fancy special effects and lets you share the fun with others. It
was written as part of Googles 2007 Summer of Code lead by daniel g.
siegel and mentored by RaphaÃ«l Slinckx. Under the hood, Cheese uses
GStreamer to apply fancy effects to photos and videos. With Cheese it is
easy to take photos of you, your friends, pets or whatever you want and
share them with others. After the success of the Summer of Code, the
development continued and we are still looking for people with nice
ideas and patches ;)</p>
