<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Bogoutil is part of the bogofilter Bayesian spam filter package.</p>
<p>It is used to dump and load bogofilters Berkeley DB databases to and
from text files, perform database maintenance functions, and to display
the values for specific words.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>-d</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to print
the contents of the database file to <strong>stdout</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>-H</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to print
a histogram of the database file to <strong>stdout</strong>. The output
is similar to bogofilter -vv. Finally, hapaxes (tokens which were only
seen once) and pure tokens (tokens which were encountered only in ham or
only in spam) are counted.</p>
<p>The <strong>-l</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to load
the data from <strong>stdin</strong> into the database file. If the
database file exists, <strong>stdin</strong> data is merged into the
database file, with counts added up.</p>
<p>The <strong>-m</strong> option tells bogoutil to perform maintenance
functions on the specified database, i.e. discard tokens that are older
than desired, have counts that are too small, or sizes (lengths) that
are too long or too short.</p>
<p>The <strong>-w</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to
display token information from the database file. The option takes an
argument, which is either the name of the wordlist (usually wordlist.db)
or the name of the directory containing it. Tokens can be listed on the
command line or piped to bogoutil. When there are extra arguments on the
command line, bogoutil will use them as the tokens to lookup. If there
are no extra arguments, bogoutil will read tokens from
<strong>stdin</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>-p</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to
display the database information for one or more tokens. The display
includes a probability column with the tokens spam score (computed using
bogofilters default values). Option <strong>-p</strong> takes the same
arguments as option <strong>-w</strong> .</p>
<p>The <strong>-r</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to
recalculate the ROBX value and print it as a six-digit fraction.</p>
<p>The <strong>-R</strong> <em>file</em> option does the same as
<strong>-r</strong>, but saves the result in the training database
without printing it.</p>
<p>The <strong>-I</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to read
its input from <em>file</em> rather than stdin.</p>
<p>The <strong>-O</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogoutil to write
its output to <em>file</em> rather than stdout.</p>
<p>The <strong>-v</strong> option produces verbose output on
<strong>stderr</strong>. This option is primarily useful for
debugging.</p>
<p>The <strong>-C</strong> inhibits reading configuration files and lets
bogoutil go with the defaults.</p>
<p>The <strong>--config-file</strong> <em>file</em> option tells
bogoutil to read <em>file</em> instead of the standard configuration
file.</p>
<p>The <strong>-D</strong> redirects debug output to stdout (it usually
goes to stderr).</p>
<p>The <strong>-x</strong> <em>flags</em> option sets debugging
flags.</p>
<p>Option <strong>-n</strong> stands for "replace non-ascii characters".
It will replace characters with the high bit (0x80) by question marks.
This can be useful if a word list has lots of unreadable tokens, for
example from Asian spam. The "bad" characters will be converted to
question marks and matching tokens will be combined when used with
<strong>-m</strong> or <strong>-l</strong>, but not with
<strong>-d</strong>.</p>
<p>Option <strong>-a age</strong> indicates an acceptable token age,
with older ones being discarded. The age can be a date (in form
YYYYMMMDD) or a day count, i.e. discard tokens older than
<strong>age</strong> days.</p>
<p>Option <strong>-c value</strong> indicates that tokens with counts
less than or equal to <strong>value</strong> are to be discarded.</p>
<p>Option <strong>-s min,max</strong> is used to discard tokens based on
their size, i.e. length. All tokens shorter than <strong>min</strong> or
longer than <strong>max</strong> will be discarded.</p>
<p>Option <strong>-y date</strong> is specifies the date to give to
tokens that dont have dates. The format is YYYYMMDD.</p>
<p>The <strong>-h</strong> option prints the help message and exits.</p>
<p>The <strong>-V</strong> option prints the version number and
exits.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT MAINTENANCE</h1>
<p>The <strong>--db-checkpoint</strong> <em>dir</em> option causes
bogoutil to flush the buffer caches and checkpoint the database
environment.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-list-logfiles</strong> <em>dir</em> option causes
bogoutil to list the log files in the environment. Zero or more keywords
can be added or combined (separated by whitespace) to modify the
behavior of this mode. The default behavior is to list only inactive log
files with relative paths. You can add <strong>all</strong> to list all
log files (inactive and active). You can add <strong>absolute</strong>
to switch the listing to absolute paths.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-prune</strong> <em>dir</em> option causes bogoutil
to checkpoint the database environment and remove inactive log
files.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-recover</strong> <em>dir</em> option runs a regular
database recovery in the specified database directory. If that fails, it
will retry with a (usually slower) catastrophic database recovery. If
that fails, too, your database cannot be repaired and must be rebuilt
from scratch. This is only supported when compiled with Berkeley DB
support with transactions enabled. Trying recovery with QDBM or SQLite3
support will result in an error.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-recover-harder</strong> <em>dir</em> option runs a
catastrophic data base recovery in the specified database directory. If
that fails, your database cannot be repaired and must be rebuilt from
scratch. This is only supported when compiled with Berkeley DB support
with transactions enabled. Trying recovery with QDBM or SQLite3 support
will result in an error.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-remove-environment</strong> <em>directory</em>
option has no short option equivalent. It runs recovery in the given
directory and then removes the database environment. Use this
<em>before</em> upgrading to a new Berkeley DB version if the new
version to be installed requires a log file format update.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-print-leafpage-count</strong> <em>file</em> option
prints the number of leaf pages in the database file <em>file</em> as a
decimal number, or UNKNOWN if the database does not support querying
this figure.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-print-pagesize</strong> <em>file</em> option prints
the size of a database page in <em>file</em> as a decimal number, or
UNKNOWN for databases with variable page size or databases that do not
allow a query of the database page size.</p>
<p>The <strong>--db-verify</strong> <em>file</em> option requests that
bogofilter verifies the database file. It prints only errors, unless in
verbose mode.</p>
<h1>DATA FORMAT</h1>
<p>Bogoutil reads and writes text files where each nonblank line
consists of a word, any amount of horizontal whitespace, a numeric word
count, more whitespace, and (optionally) a date in form YYYYMMDD. Blank
lines are skipped.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1>
<p>0 for successful operation. 1 for most errors. 3 for I/O or other
errors. Error 3 usually means that something is seriously wrong with the
database files.</p>
