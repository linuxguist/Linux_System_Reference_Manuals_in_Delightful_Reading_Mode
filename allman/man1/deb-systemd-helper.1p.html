<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>deb-systemd-helper - subset of systemctl for machines not running
systemd</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>deb-systemd-helper</strong> enable | disable | purge | mask |
unmask | is-enabled | was-enabled | debian-installed | update-state |
reenable <em>unit file</em> ...</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>deb-systemd-helper</strong> is a Debian-specific helper
script which re-implements the enable, disable, is-enabled and reenable
commands from systemctl.</p>
<p>The enable action will only be performed once (when first installing
the package). On the first enable, a state file is created which will be
deleted upon purge.</p>
<p>The mask action will keep state on whether the service was
enabled/disabled before and will properly return to that state on
unmask.</p>
<p>The was-enabled action is not present in systemctl, but is required
in Debian so that we can figure out whether a service was enabled before
we installed an updated service file. See http://bugs.debian.org/717603
for details.</p>
<p>The debian-installed action is also not present in systemctl. It
returns 0 if the state file of at least one of the given units is
present.</p>
<p>The update-state action is also not present in systemctl. It updates
<strong>deb-systemd-helper</strong>'s state file, removing obsolete
entries (e.g. service files that are no longer shipped by the package)
and adding new entries (e.g. new service files shipped by the package)
without enabling them.</p>
<p><strong>deb-systemd-helper</strong> is intended to be used from
maintscripts to enable systemd unit files. It is specifically NOT
intended to be used interactively by users. Instead, users should run
systemd and use systemctl, or not bother about the systemd enabled state
in case they are not running systemd.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt>_DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_DEBUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you export _DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_DEBUG=1, deb-systemd-helper will
print debug messages to stderr (thus visible in dpkg runs). Please
include these when filing a bugreport.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DPKG_ROOT</dt>
<dd>
<p>Instead of working on the filesystem root /, perform all operations
on a chroot system in the directory given by DPKG_ROOT.</p>
</dd>
