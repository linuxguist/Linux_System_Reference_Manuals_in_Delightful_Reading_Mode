<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>tracker3-daemon - Start, stop, restart and list daemons responsible
for indexing content</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>tracker3 daemon [options...]
tracker3 daemon -s | -t [daemons] | -k [daemons] | -l
tracker3 daemon -f | -w [ontology]
tracker3 daemon --miner &lt;miner&gt; --pause[-for-process] &lt;reason&gt;
tracker3 daemon --miner &lt;miner&gt; --resume &lt;cookie&gt;</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Tracker indexes content with daemon processes that run in the
background. The <strong>tracker3 daemon</strong> command allows for
control of these components. This ranges from starting, stopping and
killing processes to pausing and resuming them.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, there are ways to follow or watch what is
happening in real time from a top level and right down where the SPARQL
commits are happening too.</p>
<p>If no arguments are provided this command will show the current
status of all Tracker data miners.</p>
<p>The data miners can be paused or resumed using this command and you
can also list miners running and available.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-p, --list-processes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lists all Tracker processes in the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*-k, --kill</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This uses SIGKILL to stop all Tracker processes found matching the
parameter, if no extra parameter is passed, "all" will be assumed. This
is not advised unless you are having problems stopping Tracker in the
first place. This <strong>GUARANTEES</strong> death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*-t, --terminate=</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This uses SIGTERM to stop all Tracker processes. This is recommended
over --kill because it gives the processes time to shutdown cleanly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-s, --start</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starts all miners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-f, --follow</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow status changes to daemons as they happen. This is a top level
view of what is happening. You will see the name for each daemon and a
state with the progress in that state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires Ctrl+C to stop and return to the command line. Each new
status is put on a new line.</p>
<p><strong>-w, --watch=[</strong><em>ontology</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watch changes that happen to the database in real time. This requires
Ctrl+C to stop and return to the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <em>ontology</em> is unspecified, all updates are shown. The
<em>ontology</em> can be a comma separated list of shorthand or long
hand ontology properties. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>    $ tracker3 daemon -w nie:url,nie:mimeType,nfo:fileSize,nie:dataSource
    Now listening for resource updates to the database
    All nie:plainTextContent properties are omitted

    Press Ctrl+C to stop

    nfo:Document
       nfo:fileSize = 1770
       nie:dataSource = http://tracker.api.gnome.org/ontology/v3/tracker#extractor-data-source
       nie:mimeType = text/plain
       nie:url = file:///home/martyn/.bash_aliases
    nfo:Document
       nie:dataSource = http://tracker.api.gnome.org/ontology/v3/tracker#extractor-data-source

    ...</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--list-common-statuses</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will list statuses most commonly produced by miners and the
store. These statuses are not translated when sent over D-Bus and should
be translated by each application. These are not considered static and
are subject to change at any point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, these statuses are not the only ones which may be
reported by a miner. There may be other states pertaining to the
specific roles of the miner in question.</p>
<p><strong>--list-miners-running</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will list all miners which have responded to a D-Bus call.
Sometimes it is helpful to use this command with
<strong>--list-miners-available.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--list-miners-available</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will list all miners which are available even if they are not
running at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--pause-details</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For listing all miners which are paused and the reasons for being
paused, you can use this. It will also display the application that
requested the pause too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--miner=&lt;</strong><em>miner</em><strong>&gt;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This argument is used with <strong>--pause</strong> or
<strong>--resume</strong> to say which miner you want to pause or
resume. You can use the full D-Bus name, e.g.
"org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files" OR you can use the suffix, e.g.
"Files".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--pause=&lt;</strong><em>reason</em><strong>&gt;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>reason</em> here is useful to know WHY the miner should be
paused. A miner can be paused many times by multiple applications. Only
when all pauses have been resumed will it continue. If successful, a
cookie will be given to uniquely identify the request. This cookie is
used to resume the pause at a later stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--pause-for-process=&lt;</strong><em>reason</em><strong>&gt;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This works exactly the same way as <strong>--pause</strong> with the
exception that it only keeps the pause active while the calling process
is alive. As soon as you press Ctrl+C the pause is resumed
automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--resume=&lt;</strong><em>cookie</em><strong>&gt;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>cookie</em> is given by a successful <strong>--pause</strong>
command. It is a number which identifies each pause request. When all
pauses have been resumed, the miner will resume working.</p>
