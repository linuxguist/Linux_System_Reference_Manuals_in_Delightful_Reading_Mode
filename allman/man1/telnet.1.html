<p>protocol. If</p>
<p>is invoked without the</p>
<p>argument, it enters command mode, indicated by its prompt</p>
<p>In this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below. If
it is invoked with arguments, it performs an</p>
<p>command with those arguments.</p>
<p>Use IPv4 to connect to hosts.</p>

<p>if it agrees with the current user ID, otherwise it is the name
associated with the user ID.</p>
<p>Specifies no automatic login to the remote system.</p>
<p>When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system
understands the</p>
<p>option, then</p>
<p>will be sent to the remote system as the value for the variable USER.
This option implies the</p>
<p>option. This option may also be used with the</p>

remote host.</p>
<p>Indicates a port number (address of an application). If a number is
not specified, the default</p>
<p>port is used.</p>
<p>When in rlogin mode, a line of the form ~. disconnects from the
remote host; ~ is the telnet escape character. Similarly, the line ~^Z
suspends the telnet session. The line ~^] escapes to the normal telnet
escape prompt.</p>
<p>Once a connection has been opened,</p>
<p>will attempt to enable the</p>
<p>option. If this fails, then</p>
<p>will revert to one of two input modes: either character at a time or
old line by line depending on what the remote system supports.</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>is enabled, character processing is done on the local system, under
the control of the remote system. When input editing or character
echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay that
information. The remote system will also relay changes to any special
characters that happen on the remote system, so that they can take
effect on the local system.</p>
<p>In character at a time mode, most text typed is immediately sent to
the remote host for processing.</p>
<p>In old line by line mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally)
only completed lines are sent to the remote host. The local echo
character (initially ^E) may be used to turn off and on the local echo
(this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the password being
echoed).</p>
<p>If the</p>
<p>option is enabled, or if the</p>
<p>toggle is</p>
<p>(the default for old line by line; see below), the user's</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>characters are trapped locally, and sent as</p>
<p>protocol sequences to the remote side. If</p>
<p>has ever been enabled, then the user's</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>are also sent as</p>
<p>protocol sequences, and</p>
<p>is sent as a</p>

<p>command mode may be entered by typing the</p>
<p>escape character (initially ^]). When in command mode, the normal
terminal editing conventions are available.</p>
<p>The following</p>
<p>commands are available. Only enough of each command to uniquely
identify it need be typed (this is also true for arguments to the</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>commands).</p>
<p>The auth command manipulates the information sent through the</p>

through the</p>
<p>option. The initial set of variables is taken from the users
environment, with only the</p>

<p>Sends the</p>
<p>option to the remote side. This command is similar to a</p>
<p>command; however, if the remote side does not support the</p>
<p>option, nothing happens. If, however, the remote side does support
the</p>
<p>option, this command should cause the remote side to close the</p>
<p>connection. If the remote side also supports the concept of
suspending a user's session for later reattachment, the logout argument
indicates that you should terminate the session immediately.</p>

<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(Abort Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
flush all output</p>
<p>the remote system</p>
<p>the user's terminal.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(Are You There) sequence, to which the remote system may or may not
choose to respond.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(Break) sequence, which may have significance to the remote
system.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(Erase Character) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
erase the last character entered.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(Erase Line) sequence, which should cause the remote system to erase
the line currently being entered.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(End Of File) sequence.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(End of Record) sequence.</p>
<p>Sends the current</p>
<p>escape character (initially ^).</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(Go Ahead) sequence, which likely has no significance to the remote
system.</p>
<p>If the remote side supports the</p>
<p>command,</p>
<p>will send the subnegotiation to request that the server send its
current option status.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>

abort the currently running process.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(No OPeration) sequence.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>(SUSPend process) sequence.</p>
<p>Sends the</p>
<p>sequence. This sequence causes the remote system to discard all
previously typed (but not yet read) input. This sequence is sent as</p>
<p>urgent data (and may not work if the remote system is a</p>

<p>If</p>
<p>is in localchars mode, or</p>
<p>is enabled, and the status character is typed, a</p>
<p>sequence (see</p>
<p>preceding) is sent to the remote host. The initial value for the "Are
You There" character is the terminal's status character.</p>
<p>This is the value (initially ^E) which, when in line by line mode,
toggles between doing local echoing of entered characters (for normal
processing), and suppressing echoing of entered characters (for
entering, say, a password).</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is operating in</p>
<p>or old line by line mode, entering this character as the first
character on a line will cause this character to be sent to the remote
system. The initial value of the eof character is taken to be the
terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>mode (see</p>
<p>below),</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>is operating in character at a time mode, then when this character is
typed, a</p>
<p>sequence (see</p>
<p>above) is sent to the remote system. The initial value for the erase
character is taken to be the terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>This is the</p>
<p>escape character (initially ^[) which causes entry into</p>
<p>command mode (when connected to a remote system).</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>mode (see</p>
<p>below) and the</p>
<p>character is typed, a</p>
<p>sequence (see</p>

character is taken to be the terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is operating in</p>
<p>these are the characters that, when typed, cause partial lines to be
forwarded to the remote system. The initial value for the forwarding
characters are taken from the terminal's eol and eol2 characters.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>mode (see</p>
<p>below) and the</p>
<p>character is typed, a</p>

<p>If</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>mode (see</p>
<p>below),</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>is operating in character at a time mode, then when this character is
typed, a</p>
<p>sequence (see</p>
<p>above) is sent to the remote system. The initial value for the kill
character is taken to be the terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is operating in</p>
<p>or old line by line mode, then this character is taken to be the
terminal's</p>
<p>character. The initial value for the lnext character is taken to be
the terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>mode (see</p>
<p>below) and the</p>
<p>character is typed, a</p>

character is taken to be the terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is operating in</p>
<p>or old line by line mode, then this character is taken to be the
terminal's</p>
<p>character. The initial value for the reprint character is taken to be
the terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>This is the rlogin escape character. If set, the normal</p>
<p>escape character is ignored unless it is preceded by this character
at the beginning of a line. This character, at the beginning of a line
followed by a "." closes the connection; when followed by a ^Z it
suspends the telnet command. The initial state is to disable the rlogin
escape character.</p>
<p>If the</p>
<p>option has been enabled, then this character is taken to be the
terminal's</p>
<p>character. The initial value for the kill character is taken to be
the terminal's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>If the</p>
<p>option has been enabled, then this character is taken to be the
terminal's</p>

<p>If</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>mode, or</p>
<p>is enabled, and the</p>

<p>character.</p>
<p>This is the file to which the output, caused by</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>tracing being</p>
