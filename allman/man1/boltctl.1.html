<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>boltctl - control the thunderbolt device manager</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>boltctl authorize DEVICE
boltctl config
boltctl domains
boltctl enroll DEVICE
boltctl forget DEVICE
boltctl info DEVICE
boltctl list
boltctl monitor
boltctl power</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>boltctl</em> is the command line interface to interact with
<em>boltd</em>, the system daemon that manages Thunderbolt 3(TM)
devices. It can be used to query the state of devices as well as manage
them.</p>
<p>Devices can be globally identified via their unique identifier
(uuid). All commands that take a <em>DEVICE</em> identifier expect this
unique id.</p>
<p>If no command is given, it is equivalent to <em>boltctl
list</em>.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print version information and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-U | --uuid {</strong><em>full</em> <strong>|</strong>
<em>short</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>alias</em> <strong>|
N}</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control how UUIDs are printed. Since they are somewhat sensitive data
it is not advisable to share them publicly in full length. Instead
<em>short</em> or <em>alias</em> can and should be used when sharing the
output of <em>boltctl</em>.</p>
<p><em>full</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print all UUIDs in full length.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>short</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truncate all UUIDs so only the first 13 characters are printed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>alias</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All UUIDs are replaced by a random string that is derived from the
UUID, therefore the devices can be uniquely identified without revealing
the original UUID.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>N</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a integer <em>N</em> is specified, all UUIDs are truncated to only
show up to <em>N</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<h2>authorize [-F | --first-time] <em>DEVICE</em></h2>
<p>Authorize a currently unauthorized device identified via its unique
id (uuid) <em>DEVICE</em>. If a key is stored in the database it will be
used, given the security level of the domain supports secure device
connection. Use <em>boltctl list</em> to find out the uuid of a
device.</p>
<p><strong>-F | --first-time</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally, when attempting to authorize an already authorized device
<strong>boltctl</strong> will do nothing and return a successful status
code. When using this option, the attempt will fail and result in a
negative exit code if the device is already authorized.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>config --describe [global|domain|device]</h2>
<p>List global, domain, or all (if nothing is specified) properties. The
format is 3 columns: permission, name, description. Permission indicates
if the property is only readable or can also be written.</p>
<h2>config <em>KEY</em> [<em>VALUE</em>]</h2>
<p>Get or set, if <em>VALUE</em> is specified, a global property.</p>
<h2>config <em>&lt;domain|device&gt;.KEY</em> <em>TARGET</em>
[<em>VALUE</em>]</h2>
<p>Get or set, if <em>VALUE</em> is specified, a domain or device
property, where <em>TARGET</em> is the unique id of the domain or the
device.</p>
<h2>domains [-v | --verbose]</h2>
<p>List all currently active Thunderbolt domains. A Thunderbolt domain
represents the Thunderbolt controller hardware. There will be one domain
(and host device) for each Thunderbolt controller present in the system.
The <em>security</em> property shows the security level of the
controller. If <em>iommu</em> support is active (see the
<strong>boltd</strong> man page) it will be indicated by a
<em>+iommu</em> suffix for "secure" or "user" mode, or just plain
<em>iommu</em> in case the security level is "none" (sl0).
<em>bootacl</em> shows the used and total slots of the boot access
control list (BootACL) and the content of all non-empty entries. NB: if
BootACL is unsupported it will show 0 for both (0/0). The
<em>online</em> property shows if the thunderbolt controller is
currently powered by the firmware. <strong>NB</strong>: if the
controller is currently offline the BootACL list will reflect what
<em>boltd</em> estimates the list will look like once the controller is
back online and local changes have been synchronized to the controller.
This might not be accurate if the list was modified in the meantime,
e.g. from a different installation or OS.</p>
<h2>enroll [--policy <em>policy</em>] <em>DEVICE</em></h2>
<p>Authorize and record the device with the unique id <em>DEVICE</em> in
the database. If the domain supports secure connection a new key will be
generated and stored in the database alongside the device name and
vendor name. The key, if created, will be used in the future to securely
authorize the device.</p>
<p><strong>--policy {</strong><em>default</em> <strong>|</strong>
<em>auto</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>manual</em><strong>}</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the policy to be used for the newly enrolled device.</p>
<p><em>default</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the global default policy of the daemon; this can be changed, but
is normally also <em>auto</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>auto</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically authorize this device whenever it is connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>manual</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> automatically authorize the device; instead
require manual authorization via <strong>boltctl authorize</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>forget <em>DEVICE</em></h2>
<p>Remove the information about the device with the unique id
<em>DEVICE</em> from the database. This includes the key, if one was
previously generated. If you pass <em>--all</em> instead of the
<em>DEVICE</em> all devices are removed instead of just one.</p>
<h2>info <em>DEVICE</em></h2>
<p>Display information about the device with the unique id
<em>DEVICE</em>.</p>
<h2>list [-a | --all]</h2>
<p>List and print information about all connected and stored
devices.</p>
<p><strong>-a | --all</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally, the only the device type that will be shown is peripherals.
Therefore the device that represents the host itself will be omitted.
Using this option will instead include all device types in the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>monitor</h2>
<p>Listen for and show changes in connected devices.</p>
<h2>power [-t | --timeout <em>seconds</em>] [-q | --query]</h2>
<p>Power up the Thunderbolt controller. If the Thunderbolt controller is
not in "native enumeration mode" it can be completely powered down by
the host firmware/BIOS. On supported systems there is an interface to
"force" power the thunderbolt controller. If supported this command will
request the daemon to do so. The daemon will keep track of all client
requests and will release the force power override when the last request
is released.</p>
<p><strong>-t | --timeout</strong> <em>seconds</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release the force power request after the specified amount of
<em>seconds</em> and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-q | --query</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Query the current force power status of the daemon.</p>
