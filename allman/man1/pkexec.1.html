<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pkexec - Execute a command as another user</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pkexec</strong> [<strong>--version</strong>]
[<strong>--disable-internal-agent</strong>]
[<strong>--help</strong>]</p>
<p><strong>pkexec</strong> [<strong>--keep-cwd</strong>]
[<strong>--user</strong> <em>username</em>] <em>PROGRAM</em>
[<em>ARGUMENTS</em>...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>pkexec</strong> allows an authorized user to execute
<em>PROGRAM</em> as another user. If <em>PROGRAM</em> is not specified,
the default shell will be run. If <em>username</em> is not specified,
then the program will be executed as the administrative super user,
<em>root</em>.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>Upon successful completion, the return value is the return value of
<em>PROGRAM</em>. If the calling process is not authorized or an
authorization could not be obtained through authentication or an error
occured, <strong>pkexec</strong> exits with a return value of 127. If
the authorization could not be obtained because the user dismissed the
authentication dialog, <strong>pkexec</strong> exits with a return value
of 126.</p>
<h1>AUTHENTICATION AGENT</h1>
<p><strong>pkexec</strong>, like any other polkit application, will use
the authentication agent registered for the calling process or session.
However, if no authentication agent is available, then
<strong>pkexec</strong> will register its own textual authentication
agent. This behavior can be turned off by passing the
<strong>--disable-internal-agent</strong> option.</p>
<h1>SECURITY NOTES</h1>
<p>Executing a program as another user is a privileged operation. By
default the action to check for (see the section called “ACTION AND
AUTHORIZATIONS”) requires administrator authentication. In addition, the
authentication dialog presented to the user will display the full path
to the program to be executed so the user is aware of what will
happen.</p>
<p>The environment that <em>PROGRAM</em> will run it, will be set to a
minimal known and safe environment in order to avoid injecting code
through LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar mechanisms. In addition the
PKEXEC_UID environment variable is set to the user id of the process
invoking <strong>pkexec</strong>. As a result, <strong>pkexec</strong>
will not by default allow you to run X11 applications as another user
since the $DISPLAY and $XAUTHORITY environment variables are not set.
These two variables will be retained if the
<em>org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.allow_gui</em> annotation on an
action is set to a nonempty value; this is discouraged, though, and
should only be used for legacy programs.</p>
<p><strong>pkexec</strong> will run <em>PROGRAM</em> in
<em>username</em>s home directory, unless <strong>--keep-cwd</strong> is
used to override this behavior</p>
<p>Note that <strong>pkexec</strong> does no validation of the
<em>ARGUMENTS</em> passed to <em>PROGRAM</em>. In the normal case (where
administrator authentication is required every time
<strong>pkexec</strong> is used), this is not a problem since if the
user is an administrator he might as well just run <strong>pkexec
bash</strong> to get root.</p>
<p>However, if an action is used for which the user can retain
authorization (or if the user is implicitly authorized) this could be a
security hole. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, programs for which the
default required authorization is changed, should <strong>never</strong>
implicitly trust user input (e.g. like any other well-written
<em>suid</em> program).</p>
<h1>ACTION AND AUTHORIZATIONS</h1>
<p>By default, the <em>org.freedesktop.policykit.exec</em> action is
used. To use another action, use the
<em>org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path</em> annotation on an action
with the value set to the full path of the program. In addition to
specifying the program, the authentication message, description, icon
and defaults can be specified. If the
<em>org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.argv1</em> annotation is present, the
action will only be picked if the first argument to the program matches
the value of the annotation.</p>
<p>Note that authentication messages may reference variables (see the
section called “VARIABLES”), for example $(user) will be expanded to the
value of the user variable.</p>
<h1>WRAPPER USAGE</h1>
<p>To avoid modifying existing software to prefix their command-line
invocations with <strong>pkexec</strong>, its possible to use
<strong>pkexec</strong> in a <strong>she-bang wrapper</strong>[1] like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/pkexec /usr/bin/python

import os
import sys

print &quot;Hello, Im running as uid %d&quot;%(os.getuid())

for n in range(len(sys.argv)):
    print &quot;arg[%d]=`%s&quot;%(n, sys.argv[n])</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If this script is installed into /usr/bin/my-pk-test, then the
following annotations</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  [...]
  &lt;annotate key=&quot;org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path&quot;&gt;/usr/bin/python&lt;/annotate&gt;
  &lt;annotate key=&quot;org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.argv1&quot;&gt;/usr/bin/my-pk-test&lt;/annotate&gt;
  [...]</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>can be used to select the appropriate polkit action. Be careful to
get the latter annotation right, otherwise it will match any
<strong>pkexec</strong> invocation of /usr/bin/python scripts.</p>
<h1>VARIABLES</h1>
<p>The following variables are set by <strong>pkexec</strong>. They can
be used in authorization rules and messages shown in authentication
dialogs:</p>
<p><em>program</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fully qualified path to the program to be executed. Example:
“/bin/cat”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>command_line</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The requested command-line (do not use this for any security checks,
it is not secure). Example: “cat /srv/xyz/foobar”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>user</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user name of the user to execute the program as. Example:
“davidz”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>user.gecos</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The full name of the user to execute the program as. Example: “David
Zeuthen”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>user.display</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A representation of the user to execute the program as that is
suitable for display in an authentication dialog. Is typically set to a
combination of the user name and the full name. Example: “David Zeuthen
(davidz)”</p>
</blockquote>
