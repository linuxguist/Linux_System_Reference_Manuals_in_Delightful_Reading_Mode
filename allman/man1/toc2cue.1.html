<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>toc2cue - converts a TOC files of <em>cdrdao(1)</em> into a .cue
file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>toc2cue</strong> <strong>[ </strong>-v
<em>verbosity_level</em><strong> ]</strong> <em>input_toc_file
output_cue_file</em></p>
<p><strong>toc2cue</strong> <strong>[ </strong>-V<strong> ]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>toc2cue</strong> converts a TOC file of <em>cdrdao(1)</em>
into a .cue file.</p>
<p>Please note that the resulting cue file is only valid if the toc-file
was created with <em>cdrdao(1)</em> using the commands 'read-toc' or
'read-cd'. For manually created or edited toc-files the cue file may not
be correct. This program just checks for the most obvious toc-file
features that cannot be converted to a cue file. Furthermore, if the
toc-file contains audio tracks the byte order of the image file will be
wrong. This will result in static noise when the cue file is used for
recording (even with <em>cdrdao(1)</em> itself).</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-v </strong><em>verbosity_level</em></dt>
