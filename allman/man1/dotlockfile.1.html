<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dotlockfile - Utility to manage lockfiles</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>dotlockfile</strong> <strong>-l</strong> [<strong>-r</strong>
<em>retries</em>] [<strong>-i</strong> <em>interval</em>]
[<strong>-p</strong>] [<strong>-q</strong>] &lt;<strong>-m</strong> |
<em>lockfile</em>&gt;<br />
<strong>dotlockfile</strong> <strong>-l</strong> [<strong>-r</strong>
<em>retries</em>] [<strong>-i</strong> <em>interval</em>]
[<strong>-p</strong>] [<strong>-q</strong>] &lt;<strong>-m</strong> |
<em>lockfile</em>&gt; [<strong>-P</strong>] <em>cmd</em> args ...<br />
<strong>dotlockfile</strong> -u<strong> |</strong> -t<br />
</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>dotlockfile</strong> is a command line utility to reliably
create, test and remove lockfiles. It creates lockfiles
<em>reliably</em> on local and NFS filesystems, because the crucial
steps of testing for a preexisting lockfile and creating it are
performed <em>atomically</em> by a <em>single</em> call to
<em>link</em>(2). Manpage <em>lockfile_create</em>(3) describes the used
algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>dotlockfile</strong> is installed with attribute
<strong>SETGID</strong><em> mail</em> and thus can also be used to lock
and unlock mailboxes <em>even</em> if the mailspool directory is only
writable by group mail.</p>
<p>The name <strong>dotlockfile</strong> comes from the way mailboxes
are locked for updates on a lot of UNIX systems. A lockfile is created
with the same filename as the mailbox but with the string
"<em>.lock</em>" appended.</p>
<p>The names <strong>dotlock</strong> and <strong>lockfile</strong> were
already taken – hence the name <strong>dotlockfile</strong>
<em>:)</em>.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-l</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a lockfile if no preexisting valid lockfile is found, else
wait and retry according to option <strong>-r</strong>. Retry interval
can be explicitly set with option <strong>-i</strong>. This option
(<strong>-l</strong>) is the default, so it can be left off.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A lockfile is treated as valid,<br />
· if it holds the <em>process-id</em> of a running process,<br />
· or if it does not hold any <em>process-id</em> and has been touched
less than 5 minutes ago (timestamp is younger than 5 minutes).</p>
<dl>
<dt>-r retries</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of times <strong>dotlockfile</strong> retries to acquire
the lock if it failed the first time before giving up. The initial sleep
after failing to acquire the lock is 5 seconds. After each retry the
sleep interval is increased incrementally by 5 seconds up to a maximum
sleep of 60 seconds between tries unless overridden by
<strong>-i</strong>. The default number of retries is 5. To try only
once, use "<strong>-r 0</strong>". To try indefinitely, use "<strong>-r
-1</strong>".</p>
</dd>
<dt>-i interval</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets a consistent retry interval.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-u</dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove a lockfile.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-t</dt>
<dd>
<p>Touch an existing lockfile (update the timestamp). Useful for
lockfiles on NFS filesystems. For lockfiles on local filesystems the
<strong>-p</strong> option is preferable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-p</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write the <em>process-id</em> of the calling process (or dotlockfile
itself if a command is executed) into the lockfile. Also when testing
for an existing lockfile, check the contents for the <em>process-id</em>
of a running process to verify if the lockfile is still valid. Obviously
useful only for lockfiles on local filesystems.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-m</dt>
<dd>
<p>Lock or unlock the current users mailbox. The path to the mailbox is
the default system mailspool directory (usually <em>/var/mail</em>) with
the username as gotten from <em>getpwuid</em>() appended. If the
environment variable <em>$MAIL</em> is set, that is used instead. Then
the string "<em>.lock</em>" is appended to get the name of the actual
lockfile.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-q</dt>
<dd>
<p>Don't print warnings or errors to the standard error output. Used
internally by liblockfile when it spawns <strong>dotlockfile</strong> as
a helper program.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-P</dt>
<dd>
<p>On successful "lock and spawn command", don't exit with status zero,
but pass through the exit value of the spawned command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>lockfile</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lockfile to be created or removed. Must not be specified if the
<strong>-m</strong> option is given.</p>
</dd>
<dt>command argument ...</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create lockfile, run the <em>command</em> , wait for it to exit, and
remove lockfile.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>Zero on success, and non-zero on failure. When locking (the default,
or with the <strong>-l</strong> option) <strong>dotlockfile</strong>
returns the same values as the library function
<em>lockfile_create</em>(3). Unlocking a non-existent lockfile is not an
error.</p>
<p>Unless the <strong>-P</strong> option was supplied, when a command is
executed, the return value does not correspond with that of the command
that was run. If locking and unlocking was successful, the exit status
is zero.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The lockfile is created exactly as named on the command line. The
extension "<em>.lock</em>" is <em>not</em> automatically appended.</p>
<p>This utility is a lot like the <em>lockfile</em>(1) utility included
with <em>procmail</em>, and the <em>mutt_dotlock</em>(1) utility
included with <em>mutt</em>. However the command-line arguments differ,
and so does the return status. It is believed, that <em>dotlockfile</em>
is the most flexible implementation, since it automatically detects when
it needs to use privileges to lock a mailbox, and does it safely.</p>
<p>The above mentioned <em>lockfile_create</em>(3) manpage is present in
the <em>liblockfile-dev</em> package.</p>
