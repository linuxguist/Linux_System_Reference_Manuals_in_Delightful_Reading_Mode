<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dconf-service - D-Bus service for writes to the dconf database</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>dconf-service</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>dconf-service</strong> program provides the
<em>ca.desrt.dconf</em> name on the session or system bus. Users or
administrators should never need to start the service, as it will be
automatically started by <strong>dbus-daemon</strong>(1) whenever an
application tries to write settings.</p>
<p>Reading values from the dconf database does not involve the service;
it is only needed for writes. The service is stateless and can exit
freely at any time (and is therefore robust against crashes).</p>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p><strong>dconf</strong>(7), <strong>dbus-daemon</strong>(1),
<strong>systemd</strong>(1)</p>
