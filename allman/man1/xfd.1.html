<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>xfd - display all the characters in an X font</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>xfd</strong> [-options ...] <strong>-fn</strong>
<em>fontname</em></p>
<p><strong>xfd</strong> [-options ...] <strong>-fa</strong>
<em>fontname</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>xfd</em> utility creates a window containing the name of the
font being displayed, a row of command buttons, several lines of text
for displaying character metrics, and a grid containing one glyph per
cell. The characters are shown in increasing order from left to right,
top to bottom. The first character displayed at the top left will be
character number 0 unless the <strong>-start</strong> option has been
supplied in which case the character with the number given in the
<strong>-start</strong> option will be used.</p>
<p>The characters are displayed in a grid of boxes, each large enough to
hold any single character in the font. Each character glyph is drawn
using the PolyText16 request (used by the <em>Xlib</em> routine
<strong>XDrawString16</strong>) or the XftDrawString32 routine,
depending on whether the <strong>-fn</strong> or <strong>-fa</strong>
option was given. If the <strong>-box</strong> option is given, a
rectangle will be drawn around each character, showing where an
ImageText16 request (used by the <em>Xlib</em> routine
<strong>XDrawImageString16</strong>) would cause background color to be
displayed.</p>
<p>The origin of each glyph is normally set so that the character is
drawn in the upper left hand corner of the grid cell. However, if a
glyph has a negative left bearing or an unusually large ascent, descent,
or right bearing (as is the case with <em>cursor</em> font), some
character may not appear in their own grid cells. The
<strong>-center</strong> option may be used to force all glyphs to be
centered in their respective cells.</p>
<p>All the characters in the font may not fit in the window at once. To
see the next page of glyphs, press the <em>Next</em> button at the top
of the window. To see the previous page, press <em>Prev</em>. To exit
<em>xfd</em>, press <em>Quit</em>.</p>
<p>Individual character metrics (index, width, bearings, ascent and
descent) can be displayed at the top of the window by clicking on the
desired character.</p>
<p>The font name displayed at the top of the window is the full name of
the font, as determined by the server. See <em>xlsfonts</em> and
<em>fc-list</em> for ways to generate lists of fonts, as well as more
detailed summaries of their metrics and properties.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><em>xfd</em> accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options
along with the additional options listed below:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-fn <em>font</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the core X server side font to be displayed.
This can also be set with the FontGrid <strong>font</strong> resource. A
font must be specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-fa <em>font</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies a Xft font to be displayed. This can also be
set with the FontGrid <strong>face</strong> resource. A font pattern
must be specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-box</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that a box should be displayed outlining the
area that would be filled with background color by an ImageText request.
This can also be set with the FontGrid <strong>boxChars</strong>
resource. The default is False.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-center</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that each glyph should be centered in its grid.
This can also be set with the FontGrid <strong>centerChars</strong>
resource. The default is False.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-start <em>number</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the glyph index of the upper left hand corner
of the grid. This is used to view characters at arbitrary locations in
the font. This can also be set with the FontGrid
<strong>startChar</strong> resource. The default is 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-bc <em>color</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the color to be used if ImageText boxes are
drawn. This can also be set with the FontGrid <strong>boxColor</strong>
resource.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-rows <em>numrows</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the number of rows in the grid. This can also
be set with the FontGrid <strong>cellRows</strong> resource.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-columns <em>numcols</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the number of columns in the grid. This can
also be set with the FontGrid <strong>cellColumns</strong> resource.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>WIDGETS</h1>
<p>In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the widgets which
compose <em>xfd</em>. In the notation below, indentation indicates
hierarchical structure. The widget class name is given first, followed
by the widget instance name. The application class name is Xfd.</p>
<pre><code>Xfd  xfd
	Paned  pane
		Label  fontname
		Box  box
			Command  quit
			Command  prev
			Command  next
		Label  select
		Label  metrics
		Label  range
		Label  start
		Form  form
			FontGrid  grid</code></pre>
<h1>FONTGRID RESOURCES</h1>
<p>The FontGrid widget is an application-specific widget, and a subclass
of the Simple widget in the Athena widget set. The effects and instance
names of this widget's resources are given in the
<strong>OPTIONS</strong> section. Capitalize the first letter of the
resource instance name to get the corresponding class name.</p>
<h1>APPLICATION SPECIFIC RESOURCES</h1>
<p>The instance names of the application specific resources are given
below. Capitalize the first letter of the resource instance name to get
the corresponding class name. These resources are unlikely to be
interesting unless you are localizing xfd for a different language.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>selectFormat</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a printf-style format string used to display information
about the selected character. The default is "character 0x%02x%02x
(%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)". The arguments that will come after the format string
are char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1,
char.byte2. char.byte1 is byte 1 of the selected character. char.byte2
is byte 2 of the selected character.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>metricsFormat</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a printf-style format string used to display character
metrics. The default is "width %d; left %d, right %d; ascent %d, descent
%d (font %d, %d)". The arguments that will come after the format string
are the character metrics width, lbearing, rbearing, character ascent,
character descent, font ascent, and font descent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>rangeFormat</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a printf-style format string used to display the range of
characters currently being displayed. The default is "range: 0x%02x%02x
(%u,%u) thru 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u)". The arguments that will come after the
format string are the following fields from the XFontStruct that is
returned from opening the font: min_byte1, min_char_or_byte2, min_byte1,
min_char_or_byte2, max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2, max_byte1,
max_char_or_byte2.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>startFormat</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a printf-style format string used to display information
about the character at the upper left corner of the font grid. The
default is "upper left: 0x%04x (%d,%d)". The arguments that will come
after the format string are the new character, the high byte of the new
character, and the low byte of the new character.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>nocharFormat</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a printf-style format string to display when the selected
character does not exist. The default is "no such character 0x%02x%02x
(%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)". The arguments that will come after the format string
are the same as for the <strong>selectFormat</strong> resource.</p>
</dd>
