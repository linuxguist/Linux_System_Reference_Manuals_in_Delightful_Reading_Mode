<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dpkg-deb - Debian package archive (.deb) manipulation tool</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>dpkg-deb</strong> [<em>option</em>...] <em>command</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>dpkg-deb</strong> packs, unpacks and provides information
about Debian archives.</p>
<p>Use <strong>dpkg</strong> to install and remove packages from your
system.</p>
<p>You can also invoke <strong>dpkg-deb</strong> by calling
<strong>dpkg</strong> with whatever options you want to pass to
<strong>dpkg-deb</strong>. <strong>dpkg</strong> will spot that you
wanted <strong>dpkg-deb</strong> and run it for you.</p>
<p>For most commands taking an input archive argument, the archive can
be read from standard input if the archive name is given as a single
minus character («<strong>-</strong>»); otherwise lack of support will
be documented in their respective command description.</p>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-b, --build binary-directory [archive|directory]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a debian archive from the filesystem tree stored in
<em>binary-directory</em>. <em>binary-directory</em> must have a
<strong>DEBIAN</strong> subdirectory, which contains the control
information files such as the control file itself. This directory will
<em>not</em> appear in the binary package's filesystem archive, but
instead the files in it will be put in the binary package's control
information area. Unless you specify <strong>--nocheck</strong>,
<strong>dpkg-deb</strong> will read <strong>DEBIAN/control</strong> and
parse it. It will check the file for syntax errors and other problems,
and display the name of the binary package being built.
<strong>dpkg-deb</strong> will also check the permissions of the
maintainer scripts and other files found in the <strong>DEBIAN</strong>
control information directory. If no <em>archive</em> is specified then
<strong>dpkg-deb</strong> will write the package into the file
<em>binary-directory</em><strong>.deb</strong>. If the archive to be
created already exists it will be overwritten. If the second argument is
a directory then <strong>dpkg-deb</strong> will write to the file
<em>directory</em><strong>/</strong><em>package</em><strong>_</strong><em>version</em><strong>_</strong><em>arch</em><strong>.deb.</strong>
When a target directory is specified, rather than a file, the
<strong>--nocheck</strong> option may not be used (since
<strong>dpkg-deb</strong> needs to read and parse the package control
file to determine which filename to use).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-I, --info archive [control-file-name...]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides information about a binary package archive. If no
<em>control-file-name</em>s are specified then it will print a summary
of the contents of the package as well as its control file. If any
<em>control-file-name</em>s are specified then <strong>dpkg-deb</strong>
will print them in the order they were specified; if any of the
components weren't present it will print an error message to stderr
about each one and exit with status 2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-W, --show archive</dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides information about a binary package archive in the format
specified by the <strong>--showformat</strong> argument. The default
format displays the package's name and version on one line, separated by
a tabulator.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-f, --field archive [control-field-name...]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extracts control file information from a binary package archive. If
no <em>control-field-name</em>s are specified then it will print the
whole control file. If any are specified then <strong>dpkg-deb</strong>
will print their contents, in the order in which they appear in the
control file. If more than one <em>control-field-name</em> is specified
then <strong>dpkg-deb</strong> will precede each with its field name
(and a colon and space). No errors are reported for fields requested but
not found.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-c, --contents archive</dt>
<dd>
<p>Lists the contents of the filesystem tree archive portion of the
package archive. It is currently produced in the format generated by
<strong>tar</strong>'s verbose listing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-x, --extract archive directory</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extracts the filesystem tree from a package archive into the
specified directory. Note that extracting a package to the root
directory will <em>not</em> result in a correct installation! Use
<strong>dpkg</strong> to install packages. <em>directory</em> (but not
its parents) will be created if necessary, and its permissions modified
to match the contents of the package.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-X, --vextract archive directory</dt>
<dd>
<p>Is like <strong>--extract</strong> (<strong>-x</strong>) with
<strong>--verbose</strong> (<strong>-v</strong>) which prints a listing
of the files extracted as it goes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-R, --raw-extract archive directory</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extracts the filesystem tree from a package archive into a specified
directory, and the control information files into a
<strong>DEBIAN</strong> subdirectory of the specified directory (since
dpkg 1.16.1). The target directory (but not its parents) will be created
if necessary. The input archive is not (currently) processed
sequentially, so reading it from standard input («<strong>-</strong>»)
is <strong>not</strong> supported.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--ctrl-tarfile archive</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extracts the control data from a binary package and sends it to
standard output in <strong>tar</strong> format (since dpkg 1.17.14).
Together with <strong>tar</strong>(1) this can be used to extract a
particular control file from a package archive. The input archive will
always be processed sequentially.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--fsys-tarfile archive</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extracts the filesystem tree data from a binary package and sends it
to standard output in <strong>tar</strong> format. Together with
<strong>tar</strong>(1) this can be used to extract a particular file
from a package archive. The input archive will always be processed
sequentially.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-e, --control archive [directory]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extracts the control information files from a package archive into
the specified directory. If no directory is specified then a
subdirectory <strong>DEBIAN</strong> in the current directory is used.
The target directory (but not its parents) will be created if
necessary.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-?, --help</dt>
<dd>
<p>Show the usage message and exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--version</dt>
<dd>
<p>Show the version and exit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>--showformat=format</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used to specify the format of the output
<strong>--show</strong> will produce. The format is a string that will
be output for each package listed. The string may reference any status
field using the “${<em>field-name</em>}” form, a list of the valid
fields can be easily produced using <strong>-I</strong> on the same
package. A complete explanation of the formatting options (including
escape sequences and field tabbing) can be found in the explanation of
the <strong>--showformat</strong> option in
<strong>dpkg-query</strong>(1). The default for this field is
“${Package}\t${Version}\n”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-zcompress-level</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify which compression level to use on the compressor backend,
when building a package (default is 9 for gzip, 6 for xz, 3 for zstd).
The accepted values are compressor specific. For gzip, from 0-9 with 0
being mapped to compressor none. For xz from 0-9. For zstd from 0-22,
with levels from 20 to 22 enabling its ultra mode. Before dpkg 1.16.2
level 0 was equivalent to compressor none for all compressors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-Scompress-strategy</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify which compression strategy to use on the compressor backend,
when building a package (since dpkg 1.16.2). Allowed values are
<strong>none</strong> (since dpkg 1.16.4), <strong>filtered</strong>,
<strong>huffman</strong>, <strong>rle</strong> and
<strong>fixed</strong> for gzip (since dpkg 1.17.0) and
<strong>extreme</strong> for xz.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-Zcompress-type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify which compression type to use when building a package.
Allowed values are <strong>gzip</strong>, <strong>xz</strong> (since
dpkg 1.15.6), <strong>zstd</strong> (since dpkg 1.21.18) and
<strong>none</strong> (default is <strong>xz</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>--[no-]uniform-compression</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify that the same compression parameters should be used for all
archive members (i.e. <strong>control.tar</strong> and
<strong>data.tar</strong>; since dpkg 1.17.6). Otherwise only the
<strong>data.tar</strong> member will use those parameters. The only
supported compression types allowed to be uniformly used are
<strong>none</strong>, <strong>gzip</strong>, <strong>xz</strong> and
<strong>zstd</strong>. The <strong>--no-uniform-compression</strong>
option disables uniform compression (since dpkg 1.19.0). Uniform
compression is the default (since dpkg 1.19.0).</p>
</dd>
<dt>--threads-max=threads</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the maximum number of threads allowed for compressors that
support multi-threaded operations (since dpkg 1.21.9).</p>
</dd>
<dt>--root-owner-group</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the owner and group for each entry in the filesystem tree data to
root with id 0 (since dpkg 1.19.0). <strong>Note</strong>: This option
can be useful for rootless builds (see <em>rootless-builds.txt</em>),
but should <strong>not</strong> be used when the entries have an owner
or group that is not root. Support for these will be added later in the
form of a meta manifest.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--deb-format=format</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the archive format version used when building (since dpkg
1.17.0). Allowed values are <strong>2.0</strong> for the new format, and
<strong>0.939000</strong> for the old one (default is
<strong>2.0</strong>). The old archive format is less easily parsed by
non-Debian tools and is now obsolete; its only use is when building
packages to be parsed by versions of dpkg older than 0.93.76 (September
1995), which was released as i386 a.out only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--nocheck</dt>
<dd>
<p>Inhibits <strong>dpkg-deb --build</strong>'s usual checks on the
proposed contents of an archive. You can build any archive you want, no
matter how broken, this way.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-v, --verbose</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables verbose output (since dpkg 1.16.1). This currently only
affects <strong>--extract</strong> making it behave like
<strong>--vextract</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-D, --debug</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables debugging output. This is not very interesting.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>The requested action was successfully performed.</p></li>
<li><p>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line usage,
or interactions with the system, such as accesses to the database,
memory allocations, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt>DPKG_DEB_THREADS_MAX</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the maximum number of threads allowed for compressors that
support multi-threaded operations (since dpkg 1.21.9). The
<strong>--threads-max</strong> option overrides this value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DPKG_DEB_COMPRESSOR_TYPE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the compressor type to use (since dpkg 1.21.10). The
<strong>-Z</strong> option overrides this value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DPKG_DEB_COMPRESSOR_LEVEL</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the compressor level to use (since dpkg 1.21.10). The
<strong>-z</strong> option overrides this value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DPKG_COLORS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5). The currently accepted
values are: <strong>auto</strong> (default), <strong>always</strong> and
<strong>never</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TMPDIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set, <strong>dpkg-deb</strong> will use it as the directory in
which to create temporary files and directories.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set, it will be used as the timestamp (as seconds since the epoch)
in the <strong>deb</strong>(5)'s <strong>ar</strong>(5) container and
used to clamp the mtime in the <strong>tar</strong>(5) file entries.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Do not attempt to use just <strong>dpkg-deb</strong> to install
software! You must use <strong>dpkg</strong> proper to ensure that all
the files are correctly placed and the package's scripts run and its
status and contents recorded.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p><strong>dpkg-deb -I</strong> <em>package1</em><strong>.deb</strong>
<em>package2</em><strong>.deb</strong> does the wrong thing.</p>
<p>There is no authentication on <strong>.deb</strong> files; in fact,
there isn't even a straightforward checksum. (Higher level tools like
APT support authenticating <strong>.deb</strong> packages retrieved from
a given repository, and most packages nowadays provide an md5sum control
file generated by debian/rules. Though this is not directly supported by
the lower level tools.)</p>
