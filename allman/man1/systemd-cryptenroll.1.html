<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-cryptenroll - Enroll PKCS#11, FIDO2, TPM2 token/devices to
LUKS2 encrypted volumes</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> [OPTIONS...] [DEVICE]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> is a tool for enrolling hardware
security tokens and devices into a LUKS2 encrypted volume, which may
then be used to unlock the volume during boot. Specifically, it supports
tokens and credentials of the following kind to be enrolled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>PKCS#11 security tokens and smartcards that may carry an RSA key pair
(e.g. various YubiKeys)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>FIDO2 security tokens that implement the "hmac-secret" extension
(most FIDO2 keys, including YubiKeys)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>TPM2 security devices</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Regular passphrases</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Recovery keys. These are similar to regular passphrases, however are
randomly generated on the computer and thus generally have higher
entropy than user-chosen passphrases. Their character set has been
designed to ensure they are easy to type in, while having high entropy.
They may also be scanned off screen using QR codes. Recovery keys may be
used for unlocking LUKS2 volumes wherever passphrases are accepted. They
are intended to be used in combination with an enrolled hardware
security token, as a recovery option when the token is lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the tool may be used to enumerate currently enrolled
security tokens and wipe a subset of them. The latter may be combined
with the enrollment operation of a new security token, in order to
update or replace enrollments.</p>
<p>The tool supports only LUKS2 volumes, as it stores token
meta-information in the LUKS2 JSON token area, which is not available in
other encryption formats.</p>
<h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
<p>Note that currently when enrolling a new key of one of the five
supported types listed above, it is required to first provide a
passphrase or recovery key (i.e. one of the latter two key types). For
example, its currently not possible to unlock a device with a FIDO2 key
in order to enroll a new FIDO2 key. Instead, in order to enroll a new
FIDO2 key, it is necessary to provide an already enrolled regular
passphrase or recovery key. Thus, if in future key roll-over is desired
its generally recommended to combine TPM2, FIDO2, PKCS#11 key enrollment
with enrolling a regular passphrase or recovery key.</p>
<p>Also note that support for enrolling multiple FIDO2 tokens is
currently not too useful, as while unlocking
<strong>systemd-cryptsetup</strong> cannot identify which token is
currently plugged in and thus does not know which authentication request
to send to the device. This limitation does not apply to tokens enrolled
via PKCS#11 — because tokens of this type may be identified immediately,
before authentication.</p>
<h1>COMPATIBILITY</h1>
<p>Security technology both in systemd and in the general industry
constantly evolves. In order to provide best security guarantees, the
way TPM2, FIDO2, PKCS#11 devices are enrolled is regularly updated in
newer versions of systemd. Whenever this happens the following
compatibility guarantees are given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Old enrollments continue to be supported and may be unlocked with
newer versions of <strong>systemd-cryptsetup@.service</strong>(8).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The opposite is not guaranteed however: it might not be possible to
unlock volumes with enrollments done with a newer version of
<strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> with an older version of
<strong>systemd-cryptsetup</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, it is generally recommended to use matching versions of
<strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> and
<strong>systemd-cryptsetup</strong>, since this is best tested and
supported.</p>
<p>It might be advisable to re-enroll existing enrollments to take
benefit of newer security features, as they are added to systemd.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p><strong>--password</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a regular password/passphrase. This command is mostly
equivalent to <strong>cryptsetup luksAddKey</strong>, however may be
combined with <strong>--wipe-slot=</strong> in one call, see below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--recovery-key</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a recovery key. Recovery keys are mostly identical to
passphrases, but are computer-generated instead of being chosen by a
human, and thus have a guaranteed high entropy. The key uses a character
set that is easy to type in, and may be scanned off screen via a QR
code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--unlock-key-file=</strong><em>PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a file instead of a password/passphrase read from stdin to unlock
the volume. Expects the PATH to the file containing your key to unlock
the volume. Currently there is nothing like
<strong>--key-file-offset=</strong> or <strong>--key-file-size=</strong>
so this file has to only contain the full key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--pkcs11-token-uri=</strong><em>URI</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a PKCS#11 security token or smartcard (e.g. a YubiKey).
Expects a PKCS#11 smartcard URI referring to the token. Alternatively
the special value "auto" may be specified, in order to automatically
determine the URI of a currently plugged in security token (of which
there must be exactly one). The special value "list" may be used to
enumerate all suitable PKCS#11 tokens currently plugged in. The security
token must contain an RSA key pair which is used to encrypt the randomly
generated key that is used to unlock the LUKS2 volume. The encrypted key
is then stored in the LUKS2 JSON token header area.</p>
<p>In order to unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled PKCS#11 security
token, specify the <strong>pkcs11-uri=</strong> option in the respective
/etc/crypttab line:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>myvolume /dev/sda1 - pkcs11-uri=auto</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>See <strong>crypttab</strong>(5) for a more comprehensive example of
a <strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> invocation and its matching
/etc/crypttab line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--fido2-credential-algorithm=</strong><em>STRING</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify COSE algorithm used in credential generation. The default
value is "es256". Supported values are "es256", "rs256" and "eddsa".</p>
<p>"es256" denotes ECDSA over NIST P-256 with SHA-256. "rs256" denotes
2048-bit RSA with PKCS#1.5 padding and SHA-256. "eddsa" denotes EDDSA
over Curve25519 with SHA-512.</p>
<p>Note that your authenticator may not support some algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--fido2-device=</strong><em>PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a FIDO2 security token that implements the "hmac-secret"
extension (e.g. a YubiKey). Expects a hidraw device referring to the
FIDO2 device (e.g. /dev/hidraw1). Alternatively the special value "auto"
may be specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of
a currently plugged in security token (of which there must be exactly
one). The special value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable
FIDO2 tokens currently plugged in. Note that many hardware security
tokens that implement FIDO2 also implement the older PKCS#11 standard.
Typically FIDO2 is preferable, given its simpler to use and more
modern.</p>
<p>In order to unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled FIDO2 security
token, specify the <strong>fido2-device=</strong> option in the
respective /etc/crypttab line:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>myvolume /dev/sda1 - fido2-device=auto</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>See <strong>crypttab</strong>(5) for a more comprehensive example of
a <strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> invocation and its matching
/etc/crypttab line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--fido2-with-client-pin=</strong><em>BOOL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, controls whether to require
the user to enter a PIN when unlocking the volume (the FIDO2 "clientPin"
feature). Defaults to "yes". (Note: this setting is without effect if
the security token does not support the "clientPin" feature at all, or
does not allow enabling or disabling it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--fido2-with-user-presence=</strong><em>BOOL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, controls whether to require
the user to verify presence (tap the token, the FIDO2 "up" feature) when
unlocking the volume. Defaults to "yes". (Note: this setting is without
effect if the security token does not support the "up" feature at all,
or does not allow enabling or disabling it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--fido2-with-user-verification=</strong><em>BOOL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, controls whether to require
user verification when unlocking the volume (the FIDO2 "uv" feature).
Defaults to "no". (Note: this setting is without effect if the security
token does not support the "uv" feature at all, or does not allow
enabling or disabling it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-device=</strong><em>PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a TPM2 security chip. Expects a device node path referring to
the TPM2 chip (e.g. /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value "auto"
may be specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of
a currently discovered TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one).
The special value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2
devices currently discovered.</p>
<p>In order to unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled TPM2 security
chip, specify the <strong>tpm2-device=</strong> option in the respective
/etc/crypttab line:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>myvolume /dev/sda1 - tpm2-device=auto</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>See <strong>crypttab</strong>(5) for a more comprehensive example of
a <strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> invocation and its matching
/etc/crypttab line.</p>
<p>Use <strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong> (see below) to configure which TPM2
PCR indexes to bind the enrollment to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong> [PCR...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the TPM2 PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) to bind
the enrollment requested via <strong>--tpm2-device=</strong> to. Takes a
"+" separated list of numeric PCR indexes in the range 0...23. If not
used, defaults to PCR 7 only. If an empty string is specified, binds the
enrollment to no PCRs at all. PCRs allow binding the enrollment to
specific software versions and system state, so that the enrolled
unlocking key is only accessible (may be "unsealed") if specific trusted
software and/or configuration is used.</p>

</table>
<p>For most applications it should be sufficient to bind against PCR 7
(and possibly PCR 14, if shim/MOK is desired), as this includes
measurements of the trusted certificates (and possibly hashes) that are
used to validate all components of the boot process up to and including
the OS kernel. In order to simplify firmware and OS version updates its
typically not advisable to include PCRs such as 0 and 2 in the binding
of the enrollment, since the program code they cover should already be
protected indirectly through the certificates measured into PCR 7.
Validation through these certificates is typically preferable over
validation through direct measurements as it is less brittle in context
of OS/firmware updates: the measurements will change on every update,
but code signatures likely will validate against pre-existing
certificates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-with-pin=</strong><em>BOOL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When enrolling a TPM2 device, controls whether to require the user to
enter a PIN when unlocking the volume in addition to PCR binding, based
on TPM2 policy authentication. Defaults to "no". Despite being called
PIN, any character can be used, not just numbers.</p>
<p>Note that incorrect PIN entry when unlocking increments the TPM
dictionary attack lockout mechanism, and may lock out users for a
prolonged time, depending on its configuration. The lockout mechanism is
a global property of the TPM, <strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> does
not control or configure the lockout mechanism. You may use tpm2-tss
tools to inspect or configure the dictionary attack lockout, with
<strong>tpm2_getcap</strong>(1) and
<strong>tpm2_dictionarylockout</strong>(1) commands, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-public-key=</strong> [PATH],
<strong>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong> [PCR...],
<strong>--tpm2-signature=</strong> [PATH]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures a TPM2 signed PCR policy to bind encryption to. The
<strong>--tpm2-public-key=</strong> option accepts a path to a PEM
encoded RSA public key, to bind the encryption to. If this is not
specified explicitly, but a file tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem exists in one
of the directories /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/
(searched in this order), it is automatically used. The
<strong>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong> option takes a list of TPM2 PCR
indexes to bind to (same syntax as <strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong>
described above). If not specified defaults to 11 (i.e. this binds the
policy to any unified kernel image for which a PCR signature can be
provided).</p>
<p>Note the difference between <strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong> and
<strong>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong>: the former binds decryption to
the current, specific PCR values; the latter binds decryption to any set
of PCR values for which a signature by the specified public key can be
provided. The latter is hence more useful in scenarios where software
updates shell be possible without losing access to all previously
encrypted LUKS2 volumes.</p>
<p>The <strong>--tpm2-signature=</strong> option takes a path to a TPM2
PCR signature file as generated by the
<strong>systemd-measure</strong>(1) tool. If this this is not specified
explicitly a suitable signature file tpm2-pcr-signature.json is searched
for in /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/ (in this order)
and used. If a signature file is specified or found it is used to verify
if the volume can be unlocked with it given the current PCR state,
before the new slot is written to disk. This is intended as safety net
to ensure that access to a volume is not lost if a public key is
enrolled for which no valid signature for the current PCR state is
available. If the supplied signature does not unlock the current PCR
state and public key combination, no slot is enrolled and the operation
will fail. If no signature file is specified or found no such safety
verification is done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--wipe-slot=</strong> [SLOT...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wipes one or more LUKS2 key slots. Takes a comma separated list of
numeric slot indexes, or the special strings "all" (for wiping all key
slots), "empty" (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by an empty
passphrase), "password" (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a
traditional passphrase), "recovery" (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a recovery key), "pkcs11" (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a PKCS#11 token), "fido2" (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a FIDO2 token), "tpm2" (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a TPM2 chip), or any combination of these strings or numeric
indexes, in which case all slots matching either are wiped. As safety
precaution an operation that wipes all slots without exception (so that
the volume cannot be unlocked at all anymore, unless the volume key is
known) is refused.</p>
<p>This switch may be used alone, in which case only the requested wipe
operation is executed. It may also be used in combination with any of
the enrollment options listed above, in which case the enrollment is
completed first, and only when successful the wipe operation executed —
and the newly added slot is always excluded from the wiping. Combining
enrollment and slot wiping may thus be used to update existing
enrollments:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=tpm2 --tpm2-device=auto</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The above command will enroll the TPM2 chip, and then wipe all
previously created TPM2 enrollments on the LUKS2 volume, leaving only
the newly created one. Combining wiping and enrollment may also be used
to replace enrollments of different types, for example for changing from
a PKCS#11 enrollment to a FIDO2 one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=pkcs11 --fido2-device=auto</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Or for replacing an enrolled empty password by TPM2:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=empty --tpm2-device=auto</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
