<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>bf_compact - shell script to compact a bogofilter directory</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>bf_compact</strong> <em>bogofilter_directory</em>
[<em>wordlist_name</em>...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>bf_compact</strong> creates a more compact bogofilter working
directory with a dump/load cycle and renames the previous
<em>bogofilter_directory</em> to <em>bogofilter_directory</em>.old.</p>
<p>Note: <strong>bf_compact</strong> cannot be used to process the
current working directory, ".", because that cannot be renamed.</p>
<p>If no <em>wordlist_file</em> arguments are given, then
<strong>bf_compact</strong> will use the configured set of wordlists, if
the given <em>bogofilter_directory</em> is the same as the configured,
or use all *.db files if it is a different directory.</p>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>The script exits with status code 0 if everything went well, and
nonzero if it encountered trouble.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>This script will delete <em>bogofilter_directory</em>.old and all of
its contents!</p>
<p>This script expects a SUSv2 compliant shell. Solaris systems should
have the SUNWxcu4 package installed (when bogofilter is configured) so
that /usr/xpg4/bin/sh can be used.</p>
