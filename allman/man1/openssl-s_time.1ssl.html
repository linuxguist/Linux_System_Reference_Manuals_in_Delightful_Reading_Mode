<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects to a
remote host using SSL/TLS. It can request a page from the server and
includes the time to transfer the payload data in its timing
measurements. It measures the number of connections within a given
timeframe, the amount of data transferred (if any), and calculates the
average time spent for one connection.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-help</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print out a usage message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-connect host:port</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the host and optional port to connect to.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-www page</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the page to GET from the server. A value of '/' gets
the <em>index.html</em> page. If this parameter is not specified, then
this command will only perform the handshake to establish SSL
connections but not transfer any payload data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-cert certname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server. The
default is not to use a certificate. The file is in PEM format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-key keyfile</dt>
<dd>
<p>The private key to use. If not specified then the certificate file
will be used. The file is in PEM format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-verify depth</dt>
<dd>
<p>The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length of the
server certificate chain and turns on server certificate verification.
Currently the verify operation continues after errors so all the
problems with a certificate chain can be seen. As a side effect the
connection will never fail due to a server certificate verify
failure.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-new</dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs the timing test using a new session ID for each connection.
If neither <strong>-new</strong> nor <strong>-reuse</strong> are
specified, they are both on by default and executed in sequence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-reuse</dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs the timing test using the same session ID; this can be used
as a test that session caching is working. If neither
<strong>-new</strong> nor <strong>-reuse</strong> are specified, they
are both on by default and executed in sequence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-bugs</dt>
<dd>
<p>There are several known bugs in SSL and TLS implementations. Adding
this option enables various workarounds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-cipher cipherlist</dt>
<dd>
<p>This allows the TLSv1.2 and below cipher list sent by the client to
be modified. This list will be combined with any TLSv1.3 ciphersuites
that have been configured. Although the server determines which cipher
suite is used it should take the first supported cipher in the list sent
by the client. See <strong>openssl-ciphers</strong> (1) for more
information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-ciphersuites val</dt>
<dd>
<p>This allows the TLSv1.3 ciphersuites sent by the client to be
modified. This list will be combined with any TLSv1.2 and below
ciphersuites that have been configured. Although the server determines
which cipher suite is used it should take the first supported cipher in
the list sent by the client. See <strong>openssl-ciphers</strong> (1)
for more information. The format for this list is a simple colon (:)
separated list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-time length</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how long (in seconds) this command should establish
connections and optionally transfer payload data from a server. Server
and client performance and the link speed determine how many connections
it can establish.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-nameopt option</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies how the subject or issuer names are displayed. See
<strong>openssl-namedisplay-options</strong> (1) for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-CAfile file, -no-CAfile, -CApath dir, -no-CApath, -CAstore uri,
-no-CAstore</dt>
<dd>
<p>See Trusted Certificate Options in
<strong>openssl-verification-options</strong> (1) for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-provider name</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-provider-path path</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-propquery propq</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>See Provider Options in <strong>openssl</strong> (1),
<strong>provider</strong> (7), and <strong>property</strong> (7).</p>
<dl>
<dt>-cafile file</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is an obsolete synonym for <strong>-CAfile</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-ssl3, -tls1, -tls1_1, -tls1_2, -tls1_3</dt>
<dd>
<p>See TLS Version Options in <strong>openssl</strong> (1).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>This command can be used to measure the performance of an SSL
connection. To connect to an SSL HTTP server and get the default page
the command</p>
<p>openssl s_time -connect servername:443 -www / -CApath yourdir -CAfile
yourfile.pem -cipher commoncipher [-ssl3]</p>
<p>would typically be used (https uses port 443). <em>commoncipher</em>
is a cipher to which both client and server can agree, see the
<strong>openssl-ciphers</strong> (1) command for details.</p>
<p>If the handshake fails then there are several possible causes, if it
is nothing obvious like no client certificate then the
<strong>-bugs</strong> and <strong>-ssl3</strong> options can be tried
in case it is a buggy server. In particular you should play with these
options <strong>before</strong> submitting a bug report to an OpenSSL
mailing list.</p>
<p>A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working
is that a web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
list to choose from. This is normally because the server is not sending
the clients certificate authority in its acceptable CA list when it
requests a certificate. By using <strong>openssl-s_client</strong> (1)
the CA list can be viewed and checked. However, some servers only
request client authentication after a specific URL is requested. To
obtain the list in this case it is necessary to use the
<strong>-prexit</strong> option of <strong>openssl-s_client</strong> (1)
and send an HTTP request for an appropriate page.</p>
<p>If a certificate is specified on the command line using the
<strong>-cert</strong> option it will not be used unless the server
specifically requests a client certificate. Therefore, merely including
a client certificate on the command line is no guarantee that the
certificate works.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Because this program does not have all the options of the
<strong>openssl-s_client</strong> (1) program to turn protocols on and
off, you may not be able to measure the performance of all protocols
with all servers.</p>
<p>The <strong>-verify</strong> option should really exit if the server
verification fails.</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The <strong>-cafile</strong> option was deprecated in OpenSSL
3.0.</p>
