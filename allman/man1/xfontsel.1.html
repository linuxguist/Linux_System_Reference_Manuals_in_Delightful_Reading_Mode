<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>xfontsel - point and click selection of X11 font names</p>
<h1>SYNTAX</h1>
<p><strong>xfontsel</strong> [-<em>toolkitoption</em> ...]
[<strong>-pattern</strong> <em>fontname</em><strong>]</strong>
[<strong>-print]</strong> [<strong>-sample</strong>
<em>text</em><strong>]</strong> [<strong>-sample16</strong>
<em>text16</em><strong>]</strong> [<strong>-sampleUCS</strong>
<em>textUCS</em><strong>]</strong> [<strong>-scaled]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>xfontsel</em> <strong>application provides a simple way to
display</strong> the fonts known to your X server, examine samples of
each, and retrieve the X Logical Font Description ("XLFD") full name for
a font.</p>
<p>If <strong>-pattern is not specified, all fonts with XLFD
14-part</strong> names will be selectable. To work with only a subset of
the fonts, specify <strong>-pattern followed by a partially or
fully</strong> qualified font name; e.g., ``-pattern *medium*'' will
select that subset of fonts which contain the string ``medium''
somewhere in their font name. Be careful about escaping wildcard
characters in your shell.</p>
<p>If <strong>-print is specified on the command line the
selected</strong> font specifier will be written to standard output when
the <em>quit</em> button is activated. Regardless of whether or not
<strong>-print was</strong> specified, the font specifier may be made
the PRIMARY (text) selection by activating the <em>select</em>
<strong>button.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>-sample option specifies the sample text to be used
to</strong> display the selected font if the font is linearly indexed,
overriding the default.</p>
<p>The <strong>-sample16 option specifies the sample text to be used
to</strong> display the selected font if the font is matrix encoded,
overriding the default.</p>
<p>The <strong>-sampleUCS option specifies the sample text encoded in
the UTF-8</strong> form to be used to display the selected font if the
font has a CHARSET_REGISTRY of ISO10646, overriding the default.</p>
<p>The <strong>-scaled option enables the ability to select scaled
fonts</strong> at arbitrary pixel or point sizes.</p>
<h1>INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p>Clicking any pointer button in one of the XLFD field names will pop
up a menu of the currently-known possibilities for that field. If
previous choices of other fields were made, only values for fonts which
matched the previously selected fields will be selectable; to make other
values selectable, you must deselect some other field(s) by choosing the
``*'' entry in that field. Unselectable values may be omitted from the
menu entirely as a configuration option; see the
<strong>ShowUnselectable resource, below.</strong> Whenever any change
is made to a field value, <em>xfontsel</em> <strong>will</strong> assert
ownership of the PRIMARY_FONT selection. Other applications (see, e.g.,
<em>xterm</em><strong>) may then retrieve the selected font
specification.</strong></p>
<p>Scalable fonts come back from the server with zero for the pixel
size, point size, and average width fields. Selecting a font name with a
zero in these positions results in an implementation-dependent size. Any
pixel or point size can be selected to scale the font to a particular
size. Any average width can be selected to anamorphically scale the font
(although you may find this challenging given the size of the average
width menu).</p>
<p>Clicking the left pointer button in the <em>select</em>
<strong>widget will</strong> cause the currently selected font name to
become the PRIMARY text selection as well as the PRIMARY_FONT selection.
This then allows you to paste the string into other applications. The
<strong>select button remains</strong> highlighted to remind you of this
fact, and de-highlights when some other application takes the PRIMARY
selection away. The <em>select</em> <strong>widget is a toggle; pressing
it when it is highlighted</strong> will cause <em>xfontsel</em>
<strong>to release the selection ownership and</strong> de-highlight the
widget. Activating the <em>select</em> <strong>widget twice</strong> is
the only way to cause <em>xfontsel</em> <strong>to release the</strong>
PRIMARY_FONT selection.</p>
<h1>RESOURCES</h1>
<p>The application class is <strong>XFontSel. Most of the
user-interface</strong> is configured in the app-defaults file; if this
file is missing a warning message will be printed to standard output and
the resulting window will be nearly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Most of the significant parts of the widget hierarchy are documented
in <em>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XFontSel</em>,</p>
<p>Application specific resources:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>cursor (<strong>class Cursor)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the cursor for the application window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pattern (<strong>class Pattern)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the font name pattern for selecting a subset of available
fonts. Equivalent to the <strong>-pattern option.</strong> Most useful
patterns will contain at least one field delimiter; e.g. ``*-m-*'' for
monospaced fonts.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pixelSizeList (<strong>class
PixelSizeList)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a list of pixel sizes to add to the pixel size menu, so
that scalable fonts can be selected at those pixel sizes. The default
pixelSizeList contains 7, 30, 40, 50, and 60.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pointSizeList (<strong>class
PointSizeList)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a list of point sizes (in units of tenths of points) to add
to the point size menu, so that scalable fonts can be selected at those
point sizes. The default pointSizeList contains 250, 300, 350, and
400.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>printOnQuit (<strong>class
PrintOnQuit)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>True</em> <strong>the currently selected font name is
printed</strong> to standard output when the quit button is activated.
Equivalent to the <strong>-print option.</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sampleText (<strong>class Text)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The sample 1-byte text to use for linearly indexed fonts. Each glyph
index is a single byte, with newline separating lines.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sampleText16 (<strong>class Text16)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The sample 2-byte text to use for matrix-encoded fonts. Each glyph
index is two bytes, with a 1-byte newline separating lines.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>scaledFonts (<strong>class
ScaledFonts)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>True</em> <strong>then selection of arbitrary pixel and point
sizes for</strong> scalable fonts is enabled.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Widget specific resources:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>showUnselectable (<em>class</em>
<strong>ShowUnselectable)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies, for each field menu, whether or not to show values that
are not currently selectable, based upon previous field selections. If
shown, the unselectable values are clearly identified as such and do not
highlight when the pointer is moved down the menu. The full name of this
resource is <strong>fieldN.menu.options.showUnselectable,</strong> class
<strong>MenuButton.SimpleMenu.Options.ShowUnselectable;</strong> where N
is replaced with the field number (starting with the left-most field
numbered 0). The default is True for all but field 11 (average width of
characters in font) and False for field 11. If you never want to see
unselectable entries, '*menu.options.showUnselectable:False' is a
reasonable thing to specify in a resource file.</p>

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Sufficiently ambiguous patterns can be misinterpreted and lead to an
initial selection string which may not correspond to what the user
intended and which may cause the initial sample text output to fail to
match the proffered string. Selecting any new field value will correct
the sample output, though possibly resulting in no matching font.</p>
<p>Should be able to return a FONT for the PRIMARY selection, not just a
STRING.</p>
<p>Any change in a field value will cause <em>xfontsel</em> <strong>to
assert</strong> ownership of the PRIMARY_FONT selection. Perhaps this
should be parameterized.</p>
<p>When running on a slow machine, it is possible for the user to
request a field menu before the font names have been completely parsed.
An error message indicating a missing menu is printed to stderr but
otherwise nothing bad (or good) happens.</p>
<p>The average-width menu is too large to be useful.</p>
