<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>rstart - a sample implementation of a Remote Start client</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>rstart</strong> [-c <em>context</em>] [-g] [-l
<em>username</em>] [-v] <em>hostname</em> <em>command args ...</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Rstart</em> is a simple implementation of a Remote Start client
as defined in "A Flexible Remote Execution Protocol Based on
<strong>rsh</strong>". It uses <em>rsh</em> as its underlying remote
execution mechanism.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-c <em>context</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the <em>context</em> in which the command is to
be run. A <em>context</em> specifies a general environment the program
is to be run in. The details of this environment are host-specific; the
intent is that the client need not know how the environment must be
configured. If omitted, the context defaults to <strong>X</strong>. This
should be suitable for running X programs from the host's "usual" X
installation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-g</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Interprets <em>command</em> as a <em>generic command</em>, as
discussed in the protocol document. This is intended to allow common
applications to be invoked without knowing what they are called on the
remote system. Currently, the only generic commands defined are
<strong>Terminal</strong>, <strong>LoadMonitor</strong>,
<strong>ListContexts</strong>, and
<strong>ListGenericCommands</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-l <em>username</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is passed to the underlying <em>rsh</em>; it requests
that the command be run as the specified user.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option requests that <em>rstart</em> be verbose in its
operation. Without this option, <em>rstart</em> discards output from the
remote's <em>rstart</em> helper, and directs the <em>rstart</em> helper
to detach the program from the <em>rsh</em> connection used to start it.
With this option, responses from the helper are displayed and the
resulting program is not detached from the connection.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>This is a trivial implementation. Far more sophisticated
implementations are possible and should be developed.</p>
<p>Error handling is nonexistent. Without <strong>-v</strong>, error
reports from the remote are discarded silently. With
<strong>-v</strong>, error reports are displayed.</p>
<p>The $DISPLAY environment variable is passed. If it starts with a
colon, the local hostname is prepended. The local domain name should be
appended to unqualified host names, but isn't.</p>
<p>The $SESSION_MANAGER environment variable should be passed, but
isn't.</p>
<p>X11 authority information is passed for the current display.</p>
<p>ICE authority information should be passed, but isn't. It isn't
completely clear how <em>rstart</em> should select what ICE authority
information to pass.</p>
<p>Even without <strong>-v</strong>, the sample <em>rstart</em> helper
will leave a shell waiting for the program to complete. This causes no
real harm and consumes relatively few resources, but if it is
undesirable it can be avoided by explicitly specifying the "exec"
command to the shell, eg rstart somehost exec xterm</p>
<p>This is obviously dependent on the command interpreter being used on
the remote system; the example given will work for the Bourne and C
shells.</p>
