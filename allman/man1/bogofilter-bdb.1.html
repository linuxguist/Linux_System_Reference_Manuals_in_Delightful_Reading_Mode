<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter. In its normal mode of
operation, it takes an email message or other text on standard input,
does a statistical check against lists of "good" and "bad" words, and
returns a status code indicating whether or not the message is spam.
Bogofilter is designed with a fast algorithm, uses the Berkeley DB for
fast startup and lookups, coded directly in C, and tuned for speed, so
it can be used for production by sites that process a lot of mail.</p>
<h1>THEORY OF OPERATION</h1>
<p>Bogofilter treats its input as a bag of tokens. Each token is checked
against a wordlist, which maintains counts of the numbers of times it
has occurred in non-spam and spam mails. These numbers are used to
compute an estimate of the probability that a message in which the token
occurs is spam. Those are combined to indicate whether the message is
spam or ham.</p>
<p>While this method sounds crude compared to the more usual
pattern-matching approach, it turns out to be extremely effective. Paul
Grahams paper <strong>A Plan For Spam</strong>[1] is recommended
reading.</p>
<p>This program substantially improves on Pauls proposal by doing
smarter lexical analysis. Bogofilter does proper MIME decoding and a
reasonable HTML parsing. Special kinds of tokens like hostnames and IP
addresses are retained as recognition features rather than broken up.
Various kinds of MTA cruft such as dates and message-IDs are ignored so
as not to bloat the wordlist. Tokens found in various header fields are
marked appropriately.</p>
<p>Another improvement is that this program offers Gary Robinsons
suggested modifications to the calculations (see the parameters robx and
robs below). These modifications are described in Robinsons paper
<strong>Spam Detection</strong>[2].</p>
<p>Since then, Robinson (see his Linux Journal article <strong>A
Statistical Approach to the Spam Problem</strong>[3]) and others have
realized that the calculation can be further optimized using Fishers
method. <strong>Another improvement</strong>[4] compensates for token
redundancy by applying separate effective size factors (ESF) to spam and
nonspam probability calculations.</p>
<p>In short, this is how it works: The estimates for the spam
probabilities of the individual tokens are combined using the "inverse
chi-square function". Its value indicates how badly the null hypothesis
that the message is just a random collection of independent words with
probabilities given by our previous estimates fails. This function is
very sensitive to small probabilities (hammish words), but not to high
probabilities (spammish words); so the value only indicates strong
hammish signs in a message. Now using inverse probabilities for the
tokens, the same computation is done again, giving an indicator that a
message looks strongly spammish. Finally, those two indicators are
subtracted (and scaled into a 0-1-interval). This combined indicator
(bogosity) is close to 0 if the signs for a hammish message are stronger
than for a spammish message and close to 1 if the situation is the other
way round. If signs for both are equally strong, the value will be near
0.5. Since those message dont give a clear indication there is a
tristate mode in bogofilter to mark those messages as unsure, while the
clear messages are marked as spam or ham, respectively. In two-state
mode, every message is marked as either spam or ham.</p>
<p>Various parameters influence these calculations, the most important
are:</p>
<p>robx: the score given to a token which has not seen before. robx is
the probability that the token is spammish.</p>
<p>robs: a weight on robx which moves the probability of a little seen
token towards robx.</p>
<p>min-dev: a minimum distance from .5 for tokens to use in the
calculation. Only tokens farther away from 0.5 than this value are
used.</p>
<p>spam-cutoff: messages with scores greater than or equal to will be
marked as spam.</p>
<p>ham-cutoff: If zero or spam-cutoff, all messages with values strictly
below spam-cutoff are marked as ham, all others as spam (two-state).
Else values less than or equal to ham-cutoff are marked as ham, messages
with values strictly between ham-cutoff and spam-cutoff are marked as
unsure; the rest as spam (tristate)</p>
<p>sp-esf: the effective size factor (ESF) for spam.</p>
<p>ns-esf: the ESF for nonspam. These ESF values default to 1.0, which
is the same as not using ESF in the calculation. Values suitable to a
users email population can be determined with the aid of the bogotune
program.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>HELP OPTIONS</p>
<p>The <strong>-h</strong> option prints the help message and exits.</p>
<p>The <strong>-V</strong> option prints the version number and
exits.</p>
<p>The <strong>-Q</strong> (query) option prints bogofilters
configuration, i.e. registration parameters, parsing options, bogofilter
directory, etc.</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION OPTIONS</p>
<p>The <strong>-p</strong> (passthrough) option outputs the message with
an X-Bogosity line at the end of the message header. This requires
keeping the entire message in memory when its read from stdin (or from a
pipe or socket). If the message is read from a file that can be rewound,
bogofilter will read it a second time.</p>
<p>The <strong>-e</strong> (embed) option tells bogofilter to exit with
code 0 if the message can be classified, i.e. if there is not an error.
Normally bogofilter uses different codes for spam, ham, and unsure
classifications, but this simplifies using bogofilter with procmail or
maildrop.</p>
<p>The <strong>-t</strong> (terse) option tells bogofilter to print an
abbreviated spamicity message containing 1 letter and the score. Spam is
indicated with "Y", ham by "N", and unsure by "U". Note: the formatting
can be customized using the config file.</p>
<p>The <strong>-T</strong> provides an invariant terse mode for scripts
to use. bogofilter will print an abbreviated spamicity message
containing 1 letter and the score. Spam is indicated with "S", ham by
"H", and unsure by "U".</p>
<p>The <strong>-TT</strong> provides an invariant terse mode for scripts
to use. Bogofilter prints only the score and displays it to 16
significant digits.</p>
<p>The <strong>-u</strong> option tells bogofilter to register the
messages text after classifying it as spam or non-spam. A spam message
will be registered on the spamlist and a non-spam message on the
goodlist. If the classification is "unsure", the message will not be
registered. Effectively this option runs bogofilter with the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-n</strong> flag, as appropriate. Caution
is urged in the use of this capability, as any classification errors
bogofilter may make will be preserved and will accumulate until manually
corrected with the <strong>-Sn</strong> and <strong>-Ns</strong> option
combinations. Note this option causes the database to be opened for
write access, which can entail massive slowdowns through lock contention
and synchronous I/O operations.</p>
<p>The <strong>-H</strong> option tells bogofilter to not tag tokens
from the header. This option is for testing, you should not use it in
normal operation.</p>
<p>The <strong>-M</strong> option tells bogofilter to process its input
as a mbox formatted file. If the <strong>-v</strong> or
<strong>-t</strong> option is also given, a spamicity line will be
printed for each message.</p>
<p>The <strong>-b</strong> (streaming bulk mode) option tells bogofilter
to classify multiple objects whose names are read from stdin. If the
<strong>-v</strong> or <strong>-t</strong> option is also given,
bogofilter will print a line giving file name and classification
information for each file. This is an alternative to <strong>-B</strong>
which lists objects on the command line.</p>
<p>An object in this context shall be a maildir (autodetected), or if
its not a maildir, a single mail unless <strong>-M</strong> is given -
in that case its processed as mbox. (The Content-Length: header is not
taken into account currently.)</p>
<p>When reading mbox format, bogofilter relies on the empty line after a
mail. If needed, <strong>formail -es</strong> will ensure this is the
case.</p>
<p>The <strong>-B</strong> <em>object ...</em> (bulk mode) option tells
bogofilter to classify multiple objects named on the command line. The
objects may be filenames (for single messages), mailboxes (files with
multiple messages), or directories (of maildir and MH format). If the
<strong>-v</strong> or <strong>-t</strong> option is also given,
bogofilter will print a line giving file name and classification
information for each file. This is an alternative to <strong>-b</strong>
which lists objects on stdin.</p>
<p>The <strong>-R</strong> option tells bogofilter to output an R data
frame in text form on the standard output. See the section on
integration with R, below, for further detail.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION OPTIONS</p>
<p>The <strong>-s</strong> option tells bogofilter to register the text
presented as spam. The database is created if absent.</p>
<p>The <strong>-n</strong> option tells bogofilter to register the text
presented as non-spam.</p>
<p>Bogofilter doesnt detect if a message registered twice. If you do
this by accident, the token counts will off by 1 from what you really
want and the corresponding spam scores will be slightly off. Given a
large number of tokens and messages in the wordlist, this doesnt matter.
The problem <em>can</em> be corrected by using the <strong>-S</strong>
option or the <strong>-N</strong> option.</p>
<p>The <strong>-S</strong> option tells bogofilter to undo a prior
registration of the same message as spam. If a message was incorrectly
entered as spam by <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-u</strong> and you
want to remove it and enter it as non-spam, use <strong>-Sn</strong>. If
<strong>-S</strong> is used for a message that wasnt registered as spam,
the counts will still be decremented.</p>
<p>The <strong>-N</strong> option tells bogofilter to undo a prior
registration of the same message as non-spam. If a message was
incorrectly entered as non-spam by <strong>-n</strong> or
<strong>-u</strong> and you want to remove it and enter it as spam, then
use <strong>-Ns</strong>. If <strong>-N</strong> is used for a message
that wasnt registered as non-spam, the counts will still be
decremented.</p>
<p>GENERAL OPTIONS</p>
<p>The <strong>-c</strong> <em>filename</em> option tells bogofilter to
read the config file named.</p>
<p>The <strong>-C</strong> option prevents bogofilter from reading
configuration files.</p>
<p>The <strong>-d</strong> <em>dir</em> option allows you to set the
directory for the database. See the ENVIRONMENT section for other
directory setting options.</p>
<p>The <strong>-k</strong> <em>cachesize</em> option sets the cache size
for the BerkeleyDB subsystem, in units of 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes).
Properly sizing the cache improves bogofilters performance. The
recommended size is one third of the size of the database file. You can
run the bogotune script (in the tuning directory) to determine the
recommended size.</p>
<p>The <strong>-l</strong> option writes an informational line to the
system log each time bogofilter is run. The information logged depends
on how bogofilter is run.</p>
<p>The <strong>-L</strong> <em>tag</em> option configures a tag which
can be included in the information being logged by the
<strong>-l</strong> option, but it requires a custom format that
includes the %l string for now. This option implies
<strong>-l</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>-I</strong> <em>filename</em> option tells bogofilter to
read its input from the specified file, rather than from
<strong>stdin</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>-O</strong> <em>filename</em> option tells bogofilter
where to write its output in passthrough mode. Note that this only works
when -p is explicitly given.</p>
<p>PARAMETER OPTIONS</p>
<p>The <strong>-E</strong> <em>value[,value]</em> option allows setting
the sp-esf value and the ns-esf value. With two values, both sp-esf and
ns-esf are set. If only one value is given, parameters are set as
described in the note below.</p>
<p>The <strong>-m</strong> <em>value[,value][,value]</em> option allows
setting the min-dev value and, optionally, the robs and robx values.
With three values, min-dev, robs, and robx are all set. If fewer values
are given, parameters are set as described in the note below.</p>
<p>The <strong>-o</strong> <em>value[,value]</em> option allows setting
the spam-cutoff ham-cutoff values. With two values, both spam-cutoff and
ham-cutoff are set. If only one value is given, parameters are set as
described in the note below.</p>
<p>Note: All of these options allow fewer values to be provided. Values
can be skipped by using just the comma delimiter, in which case the
corresponding parameter(s) wont be changed. If only the first value is
provided, then only the first parameter is set. Trailing values can be
skipped, in which case the corresponding parameters wont be changed.
Within the parameter list, spaces are not allowed after commas.</p>
<p>INFO OPTIONS</p>
<p>The <strong>-v</strong> option produces a report to standard output
on bogofilters analysis of the input. Each additional <strong>v</strong>
will increase the verbosity of the output, up to a maximum of 4. With
<strong>-vv</strong>, the report lists the tokens with highest deviation
from a mean of 0.5 association with spam.</p>
<p>Option <strong>-y date</strong> can be used to override the current
date when timestamping tokens. A value of zero (0) turns off
timestamping.</p>
<p>The <strong>-D</strong> option redirects debug output to stdout.</p>
<p>The <strong>-x</strong> <em>flags</em> option allows setting of debug
flags for printing debug information. See header file debug.h for the
list of usable flags.</p>
<p>CONFIG FILE OPTIONS</p>
<p>Using GNU longopt <strong>--</strong> syntax, a config files
<em>name=value</em> statement becomes a command lines
<strong>--</strong><em>option=value</em>. Use command <strong>bogofilter
--help</strong> for a list of options and see bogofilter.cf.example for
more info on them. For example to change the X-Bogosity header to
"X-Spam-Header", use:</p>
<p><em>--spam-header-name=X-Spam-Header</em></p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>Bogofilter uses a database directory, which can be set in the config
file. If not set there, bogofilter will use the value of
<strong>BOGOFILTER_DIR</strong>. Both can be overridden by the
<strong>-d</strong> <em>dir</em> option. If none of that is available,
bogofilter will use directory $HOME/.bogofilter.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The bogofilter command line allows setting of many options that
determine how bogofilter operates. File /etc/bogofilter.cf can be used
to set additional parameters that affect its operation. File
/etc/bogofilter.cf.example has samples of all of the parameters. Status
and logging messages can be customized for each site.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1>
<p>0 for spam; 1 for non-spam; 2 for unsure ; 3 for I/O or other
errors.</p>
<p>If both <strong>-p</strong> and <strong>-e</strong> are used, the
return values are: 0 for spam or non-spam; 3 for I/O or other
errors.</p>
<p>Error 3 usually means that the wordlist file bogofilter wants to read
at startup is missing or the hard disk has filled up in
<strong>-p</strong> mode.</p>
<h1>INTEGRATION WITH OTHER TOOLS</h1>
<p>Use with procmail</p>
<p>The following recipe (a) spam-bins anything that bogofilter rates as
spam, (b) registers the words in messages rated as spam as such, and (c)
registers the words in messages rated as non-spam as such. With this in
place, it will normally only be necessary for the user to intervene
(with <strong>-Ns</strong> or <strong>-Sn</strong>) when bogofilter
miscategorizes something.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
# filter mail through bogofilter, tagging it as Ham, Spam, or Unsure,
# and updating the wordlist

:0fw
| bogofilter -u -e -p


# if bogofilter failed, return the mail to the queue;
# the MTA will retry to deliver it later
# 75 is the value for EX_TEMPFAIL in /usr/include/sysexits.h

:0e
{ EXITCODE=75 HOST }


# file the mail to spam-bogofilter if its spam.

:0:
* ^X-Bogosity: Spam, tests=bogofilter
spam-bogofilter

# file the mail to unsure-bogofilter 
# if its neither ham nor spam.

:0:
* ^X-Bogosity: Unsure, tests=bogofilter
unsure-bogofilter

# With this recipe, you can train bogofilter starting with an empty
# wordlist.  Be sure to check your unsure-folder regularly, take the
# messages out of it, classify them as ham (or spam), and use them to
# train bogofilter.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following procmail rule will take mail on stdin and save it to
file spam if bogofilter thinks its spam:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>:0HB:
* ? bogofilter
spam</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>and this similar rule will also register the tokens in the mail
according to the bogofilter classification:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>:0HB:
* ? bogofilter -u
spam</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If bogofilter fails (returning 3) the message will be treated as
non-spam.</p>
<p>This one is for maildrop, it automatically defers the mail and
retries later when the xfilter command fails, use this in your
~/.mailfilter:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>xfilter &quot;bogofilter -u -e -p&quot;
if (/^X-Bogosity: Spam, tests=bogofilter/)
{
  to &quot;spam-bogofilter&quot;
}</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following .muttrc lines will create mutt macros for dispatching
mail to bogofilter.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>macro index d &quot;&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n\
&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n\n\
&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n\
&lt;delete-message&gt;&quot; &quot;delete message as non-spam&quot;
macro index \ed &quot;&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n\
&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -s\n\
&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n\
&lt;delete-message&gt;&quot; &quot;delete message as spam&quot;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Integration with Mail Transport Agent (MTA)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>bogofilter can also be integrated into an MTA to filter all incoming
mail. While the specific implementation is MTA dependent, the general
steps are as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Install bogofilter on the mail server</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Prime the bogofilter databases with a spam and non-spam corpus. Since
bogofilter will be serving a larger community, it is important to prime
it with a representative set of messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Set up the MTA to invoke bogofilter on each message. While this is an
MTA specific step, youll probably need to use the <strong>-p</strong>,
<strong>-u</strong>, and <strong>-e</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Set up a mechanism for users to register spam/non-spam messages, as
well as to correct mis-classifications. The most generic solution is to
set up alias email addresses to which users bounce messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6.</p>
<p>See the doc and contrib directories for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use of R to verify bogofilters calculations</p>
<p>The -R option tells bogofilter to generate an R data frame. The data
frame contains one row per token analyzed. Each such row contains the
token, the sum of its database "good" and "spam" counts, the "good"
count divided by the number of non-spam messages used to create the
training database, the "spam" count divided by the spam message count,
Robinsons f(w) for the token, the natural logs of (1 - f(w)) and f(w),
and an indicator character (+ if the tokens f(w) value exceeded the
minimum deviation from 0.5, - if it didnt). There is one additional row
at the end of the table that contains a label in the token field,
followed by the number of words actually used (the ones with +
indicators), Robinsons P, Q, S, s and x values and the minimum
deviation.</p>
<p>The R data frame can be saved to a file and later read into an R
session (see <strong>the R project website</strong>[5] for information
about the mathematics package R). Provided with the bogofilter
distribution is a simple R script (file bogo.R) that can be used to
verify bogofilters calculations. Instructions for its use are included
in the script in the form of comments.</p>
<h1>LOG MESSAGES</h1>
<p>Bogofilter writes messages to the system log when the
<strong>-l</strong> option is used. What is written depends on which
other flags are used.</p>
<p>A classification run will generate (we are not showing the date and
host part here):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bogofilter[1412]: X-Bogosity: Ham, spamicity=0.000227
bogofilter[1415]: X-Bogosity: Spam, spamicity=0.998918</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Using <strong>-u</strong> to classify a message and update a wordlist
will produce (one a single line):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bogofilter[1426]: X-Bogosity: Spam, spamicity=0.998918,
  register -s, 329 words, 1 messages
    </code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Registering words (<strong>-l</strong> and <strong>-s</strong>,
<strong>-n</strong>, <strong>-S</strong>, or <strong>-N</strong>) will
produce:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bogofilter[1440]: register-n, 255 words, 1 messages</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A registration run (using <strong>-s</strong>, <strong>-n</strong>,
<strong>-N</strong>, or <strong>-S</strong>) will generate messages
like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bogofilter[17330]: register-n, 574 words, 3 messages
bogofilter[6244]: register-s, 1273 words, 4 messages</code></pre>
