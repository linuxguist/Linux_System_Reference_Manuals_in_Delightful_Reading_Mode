<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>bogotune - find optimum parameter settings for bogofilter</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>bogotune</strong> [-v] [-c <em>config</em>] [-C] [-d
<em>dir</em>] [-D] [-r <em>value</em>] [-T <em>value</em>] -n
<em>okfile</em> [[-n] <em>okfile</em> [...]] -s <em>spamfile</em> [[-s]
<em>spamfile</em> [...]] [-M <em>file</em>]</p>
<p><strong>bogotune</strong> [-h]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Bogotune tries to find optimum parameter settings for bogofilter. It
needs at least one set each of spam and non-spam messages. The
production wordlist is normally used, but it can be directed to read a
different wordlist, or to build its own from half the supplied
messages.</p>
<p>In order to produce useful results, bogotune has minimum message
count requirements. The wordlist it uses must have at least 2,000 spam
and 2,000 non-spam in it and the message files must contain at least 500
spam and 500 non-spam messages. Also, the ratio of spam to non-spam
should be in the range 0.2 to 5. If you direct bogotune to build its own
wordlist, it will use the half the input or 2000 messages (whichever is
larger) for the wordlist.</p>
<p>Message files may be in mbox, maildir, or MH folder or any
combination. Msg-count files can also be used, but not mixed with other
formats.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>-h</strong> option prints the help message and exits.</p>
<p>The <strong>-v</strong> option increases the verbosity level. Level 1
displays the scan output in detail instead of using a progress
meter.</p>
<p>The <strong>-c</strong> <em>filename</em> option tells bogofilter to
read the config file named.</p>
<p>The <strong>-C</strong> option prevents bogotune from reading a
configuration file.</p>
<p>The <strong>-d</strong> <em>dir</em> option specifies the directory
for the database. See the ENVIRONMENT section for other directory
setting options.</p>
<p>The <strong>-D</strong> option tells bogotune to build a wordlist in
memory using the input messages. The messages are read and divided into
two groups. The first group is used to build a wordlist (in ram) and the
second is used for tuning. To meet the minimum requirements of 2000
messages in the wordlist and 500 messages for testing, when
<strong>-D</strong> is used, there must be 2500 non-spam and 2500 spam
in the input files. If there are enough messages (more than 4000), they
will be split evenly between wordlist and testing. Otherwise, they will
be split proportionately.</p>
<p>The <strong>-n</strong> option tells bogotune that the following
argument is a file (or folder) containing non-spam. Since version 1.0.3,
multiple arguments to the <strong>-n</strong> option can be given. All
non-option arguments until the next <strong>-s</strong> option will be
treated as though they had been preceded by <strong>-n</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>-s</strong> option tells bogotune that the following
argument is a file (or folder) containing spam. It can be repeated as
often as necessary. Since version 1.0.3, multiple arguments to the
<strong>-s</strong> can be given. All non-option arguments until the
next <strong>-n</strong> option will be treated as though they had been
preceded by <strong>-s</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>-r</strong> <em>value</em> option tells bogotune to use
the following parameter as the robx value.</p>
<p>The <strong>-T</strong> <em>value</em> option tells bogotune to use
the following parameter as fp target value.</p>
<p>The <strong>-M</strong> <em>file</em> option tells bogotune to
convert the file to message count format. This format provides a sorted
list of each messages unique tokens, along with their ham and spam
counts. Sorting hides the sense of the messages quite effectively, thus
protecting privacy. The message-count format allows bogotune and
bogofilter to score messages quickly without needing the original token
database.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>Bogofilter uses a database directory, which can be set in the config
file. If not set there, bogofilter will use the value of
<strong>BOGOFILTER_DIR</strong>. Both can be overridden by the
<strong>-d</strong><em>dir</em> option. If none of that is available,
bogofilter will use directory $HOME/.bogofilter.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Bogotune is not particularly robust when presented with garbage
input.</p>
