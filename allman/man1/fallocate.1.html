<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>fallocate - preallocate or deallocate space to a file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>fallocate</strong>
[<strong>-c</strong>|<strong>-p</strong>|<strong>-z</strong>]
[<strong>-o</strong> <em>offset</em>] <strong>-l</strong>
<em>length</em> [<strong>-n</strong>] <em>filename</em></p>
<p><strong>fallocate</strong> <strong>-d</strong> [<strong>-o</strong>
<em>offset</em>] [<strong>-l</strong> <em>length</em>]
<em>filename</em></p>
<p><strong>fallocate</strong> <strong>-x</strong> [<strong>-o</strong>
<em>offset</em>] <strong>-l</strong> <em>length filename</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>fallocate</strong> is used to manipulate the allocated disk
space for a file, either to deallocate or preallocate it. For
filesystems which support the <strong>fallocate</strong>(2) system call,
preallocation is done quickly by allocating blocks and marking them as
uninitialized, requiring no IO to the data blocks. This is much faster
than creating a file by filling it with zeroes.</p>
<p>The exit status returned by <strong>fallocate</strong> is 0 on
success and 1 on failure.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The <em>length</em> and <em>offset</em> arguments may be followed by
the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for
GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB, and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has
the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000),
and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, and YB.</p>
<p>The options <strong>--collapse-range</strong>,
<strong>--dig-holes</strong>, <strong>--punch-hole</strong>, and
<strong>--zero-range</strong> are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--collapse-range</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removes a byte range from a file, without leaving a hole. The byte
range to be collapsed starts at <em>offset</em> and continues for
<em>length</em> bytes. At the completion of the operation, the contents
of the file starting at the location <em>offset</em>+<em>length</em>
will be appended at the location <em>offset</em>, and the file will be
<em>length</em> bytes smaller. The option <strong>--keep-size</strong>
may not be specified for the collapse-range operation.</p>
<p>Available since Linux 3.15 for ext4 (only for extent-based files) and
XFS.</p>
<p>A filesystem may place limitations on the granularity of the
operation, in order to ensure efficient implementation. Typically,
<em>offset</em> and <em>length</em> must be a multiple of the filesystem
logical block size, which varies according to the filesystem type and
configuration. If a filesystem has such a requirement, the operation
will fail with the error <strong>EINVAL</strong> if this requirement is
violated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-d</strong>, <strong>--dig-holes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detect and dig holes. This makes the file sparse in-place, without
using extra disk space. The minimum size of the hole depends on
filesystem I/O block size (usually 4096 bytes). Also, when using this
option, <strong>--keep-size</strong> is implied. If no range is
specified by <strong>--offset</strong> and <strong>--length</strong>,
then the entire file is analyzed for holes.</p>
<p>You can think of this option as doing a "<strong>cp
--sparse</strong>" and then renaming the destination file to the
original, without the need for extra disk space.</p>
<p>See <strong>--punch-hole</strong> for a list of supported
filesystems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-i</strong>, <strong>--insert-range</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insert a hole of <em>length</em> bytes from <em>offset</em>, shifting
existing data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-l</strong>, <strong>--length</strong> <em>length</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the length of the range, in bytes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--keep-size</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not modify the apparent length of the file. This may effectively
allocate blocks past EOF, which can be removed with a truncate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-o</strong>, <strong>--offset</strong> <em>offset</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the beginning offset of the range, in bytes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-p</strong>, <strong>--punch-hole</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deallocates space (i.e., creates a hole) in the byte range starting
at <em>offset</em> and continuing for <em>length</em> bytes. Within the
specified range, partial filesystem blocks are zeroed, and whole
filesystem blocks are removed from the file. After a successful call,
subsequent reads from this range will return zeroes. This option may not
be specified at the same time as the <strong>--zero-range</strong>
option. Also, when using this option, <strong>--keep-size</strong> is
implied.</p>
<p>Supported for XFS (since Linux 2.6.38), ext4 (since Linux 3.0), Btrfs
(since Linux 3.7), tmpfs (since Linux 3.5) and gfs2 (since Linux
4.16).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-v</strong>, <strong>--verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable verbose mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-x</strong>, <strong>--posix</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable POSIX operation mode. In that mode allocation operation always
completes, but it may take longer time when fast allocation is not
supported by the underlying filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-z</strong>, <strong>--zero-range</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zeroes space in the byte range starting at <em>offset</em> and
continuing for <em>length</em> bytes. Within the specified range, blocks
are preallocated for the regions that span the holes in the file. After
a successful call, subsequent reads from this range will return
zeroes.</p>
<p>Zeroing is done within the filesystem preferably by converting the
range into unwritten extents. This approach means that the specified
range will not be physically zeroed out on the device (except for
partial blocks at the either end of the range), and I/O is (otherwise)
required only to update metadata.</p>
<p>Option <strong>--keep-size</strong> can be specified to prevent file
length modification.</p>
<p>Available since Linux 3.14 for ext4 (only for extent-based files) and
XFS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print version and exit.</p>
