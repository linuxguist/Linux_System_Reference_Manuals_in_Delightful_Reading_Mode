<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>gnome-control-center - Configure GNOME settings</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>gnome-control-center</strong> <strong>[OPTION...]</strong>
<strong></strong> <strong>[PANEL]</strong> <strong></strong>
<strong>[ARG...]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>gnome-control-center</strong> is a graphical user interface
to configure various aspects of GNOME.</p>
<p>When run without arguments, the shell displays the overview, which
shows all available configuration panels. The overview allows to open
individual panels by clicking on them. It also has a search entry to
find panels by searching keywords.</p>
<p>It is also possible to specify a panel name as commandline argument
to go directly to that panel. Individual panels may accept further
arguments to specify which tab to open (for multi-tabbed panels) or
which item to display (for panels with lists).</p>
<p>Note that <strong>gnome-control-center</strong> is not meant to
expose each and every setting that is available. The settings that can
be found here represent what is considered useful and commonly needed
options. For more exotic or uncommon options, you can look at

commandline utility.</p>
