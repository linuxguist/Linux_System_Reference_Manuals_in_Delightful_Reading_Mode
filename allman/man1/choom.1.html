<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Linux kernel uses the badness heuristic to select which process gets
killed in out of memory conditions.</p>
<p>The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging
from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is
targeted. The units are roughly a proportion along that range of allowed
memory the process may allocate from based on an estimation of its
current memory and swap use. For example, if a task is using all allowed
memory, its badness score will be 1000. If it is using half of its
allowed memory, its score will be 500.</p>
<p>There is an additional factor included in the badness score: the
current memory and swap usage is discounted by 3% for root
processes.</p>
<p>The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in which the
oom killer was called. If it is due to the memory assigned to the
allocating task’s cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory represents
the set of mems assigned to that cpuset. If it is due to a mempolicy’s
node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of
mempolicy nodes. If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being
reached, the allowed memory is that configured limit. Finally, if it is
due to the entire system being out of memory, the allowed memory
represents all allocatable resources.</p>
<p>The adjust score value is added to the badness score before it is
used to determine which task to kill. Acceptable values range from -1000
to +1000. This allows userspace to polarize the preference for oom
killing either by always preferring a certain task or completely
disabling it. The lowest possible value, -1000, is equivalent to
disabling oom killing entirely for that task since it will always report
a badness score of 0.</p>
<p>Setting an adjust score value of +500, for example, is roughly
equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the same system,
cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller resources to use at least 50%
more memory. A value of -500, on the other hand, would be roughly
equivalent to discounting 50% of the task’s allowed memory from being
considered as scoring against the task.</p>
