<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>tracker-writeback-3 - Used to write metadata set in Tracker back to
physical files.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>tracker-writeback</strong> [<em>OPTION</em>...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>tracker-writeback</strong> is not supposed to be run by the
user since it is started by its .desktop file when the user logs in. It
can also be started manually of course for debugging purposes. You can
not run more than one instance of this at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>tracker-writeback</strong> writes metadata from the Tracker
database back into files only. Currently support is limited to XMP
metadata (which covers PNG, JPEG, TIFF, MP4 and 3GPP formats), play
lists (which covers MPEGURL, SCPLS and IRIVER formats) and taglib
supported mime types (which covers MP3, MP4, OGG, WAV, FLAC and some
Windows media formats).</p>
<p>Data is only written back if write-back is enabled in the
tracker-miner-fs configuration.</p>
