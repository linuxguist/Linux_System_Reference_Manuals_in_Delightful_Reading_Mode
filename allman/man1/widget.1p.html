<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>widget - Demonstration of Perl/Tk widgets</p>
<h1>SYNOPSYS</h1>
<p>widget [ directory ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This script demonstrates the various widgets provided by Tk, along
with many of the features of the Tk toolkit. This file only contains
code to generate the main window for the application, which invokes
individual demonstrations. The code for the actual demonstrations is
contained in separate .pl files in the widget_lib directory, which are
autoloaded by this script as needed.</p>
<p>widget looks in the directory specified on the command line to load
user contributed demonstrations. If no directory name is specified when
widget is invoked and the environment variable WIDTRIB is defined then
demonstrations are loaded from the WIDTRIB directory. If WIDTRIB is
undefined then widget defaults to the released user contributed
directory, widtrib.</p>
