<p>adds private key identities to the authentication agent,</p>
<p>When run without arguments, it adds the files</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>After loading a private key,</p>
<p>will try to load corresponding certificate information from the
filename obtained by appending</p>
<p>to the name of the private key file. Alternative file names can be
given on the command line.</p>
<p>If any file requires a passphrase,</p>
<p>asks for the passphrase from the user. The passphrase is read from
the user's tty.</p>
<p>retries the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.</p>
<p>The authentication agent must be running and the</p>
<p>environment variable must contain the name of its socket for</p>
<p>to work.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation
before being used for authentication. Confirmation is performed by</p>
<p>Successful confirmation is signaled by a zero exit status from</p>
<p>rather than text entered into the requester.</p>
<p>Deletes all identities from the agent.</p>
<p>Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent.
If</p>
<p>has been run without arguments, the keys for the default identities
and their corresponding certificates will be removed. Otherwise, the
argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to public key files
to specify keys and certificates to be removed from the agent. If no
public key is found at a given path,</p>
<p>will append</p>
<p>and retry. If the argument list consists of</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>will read public keys to be removed from standard input.</p>
<p>Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints.
Valid options are:</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The default is</p>
<p>Remove keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library</p>
<p>Specifies a known hosts file to look up hostkeys when using
destination-constrained keys via the</p>
<p>flag. This option may be specified multiple times to allow multiple
files to be searched. If no files are specified,</p>
<p>will use the default</p>
<p>known hosts files:</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>When adding keys, constrain them to be usable only through specific
hosts or to specific destinations.</p>
<p>Destination constraints of the form</p>
<p>permit use of the key only from the origin host (the one running</p>
<p>to the listed destination host, with optional user name.</p>
<p>Constraints of the form</p>
<p>allow a key available on a forwarded</p>
<p>to be used through a particular host (as specified by</p>
<p>to authenticate to a further host, specified by</p>
<p>Multiple destination constraints may be added when loading keys. When
attempting authentication with a key that has destination constraints,
the whole connection path, including</p>
<p>forwarding, is tested against those constraints and each hop must be
permitted for the attempt to succeed. For example, if key is forwarded
to a remote host,</p>
<p>and is attempting authentication to another host,</p>
<p>then the operation will be successful only if</p>
<p>was permitted from the origin host and the subsequent</p>
<p>hop is also permitted by destination constraints.</p>
<p>Hosts are identified by their host keys, and are looked up from known
hosts files by</p>
<p>Wildcards patterns may be used for hostnames and certificate host
keys are supported. By default, keys added by</p>
<p>are not destination constrained.</p>
<p>Destination constraints were added in OpenSSH release 8.9. Support in
both the remote SSH client and server is required when using
destination-constrained keys over a forwarded</p>
<p>channel.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that destination constraints can only be
enforced by</p>
<p>when a key is used, or when it is forwarded by a</p>
<p>Specifically, it does not prevent an attacker with access to a
remote</p>
<p>from forwarding it again and using it on a different host (but only
to a permitted destination).</p>
<p>Load resident keys from a FIDO authenticator.</p>
<p>When loading keys into or deleting keys from the agent, process plain
private keys only and skip certificates.</p>
<p>Lists public key parameters of all identities currently represented
by the agent.</p>
<p>Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the
agent.</p>
<p>Be quiet after a successful operation.</p>
<p>Specifies a path to a library that will be used when adding FIDO
authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the internal
USB HID support.</p>
<p>Add keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library</p>
<p>Tests whether the private keys that correspond to the specified</p>
<p>files are usable by performing sign and verify operations on
each.</p>
<p>Set a maximum lifetime when adding identities to an agent. The
lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a time format specified
in</p>
<p>Verbose mode. Causes</p>
<p>to print debugging messages about its progress. This is helpful in
debugging problems. Multiple</p>
<p>options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3.</p>
<p>Unlock the agent.</p>
<p>Lock the agent with a password.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current
terminal if it was run from a terminal. If</p>
<p>does not have a terminal associated with it but</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>are set, it will execute the program specified by</p>
<p>(by default</p>
<p>and open an X11 window to read the passphrase. This is particularly
useful when calling</p>
<p>from a</p>
<p>or related script.</p>
<p>allows further control over the use of an askpass program. If this
variable is set to</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>will never attempt to use one. If it is set to</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>will prefer to use the askpass program instead of the TTY when
requesting passwords. Finally, if the variable is set to</p>
<p>then the askpass program will be used for all passphrase input
regardless of whether</p>
<p>is set.</p>
<p>Identifies the path of a</p>
<p>socket used to communicate with the agent.</p>
<p>Specifies a path to a library that will be used when loading any FIDO
authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the built-in
USB HID support.</p>
<p>Contains the DSA, ECDSA, authenticator-hosted ECDSA, Ed25519,
authenticator-hosted Ed25519 or RSA authentication identity of the
user.</p>
<p>Identity files should not be readable by anyone but the user. Note
that</p>
<p>ignores identity files if they are accessible by others.</p>
<p>Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if the specified command fails, and 2
if</p>

<p>OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release
by Tatu Ylonen. Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos,
Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer features
and created OpenSSH. Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH
protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.</p>
