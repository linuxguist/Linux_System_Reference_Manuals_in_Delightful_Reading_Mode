<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>koi8rxterm - X terminal emulator for KOI8-R environments</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>koi8rxterm</strong> [ <em>xterm-options</em> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>koi8rxterm</strong> is a wrapper around the
<strong>xterm(1)</strong> program that invokes the latter program with
the KOI8RXTerm X resource class set. All arguments to
<strong>koi8rxterm</strong> are passed to <strong>xterm</strong> without
processing; the <strong>-class</strong> and <strong>-k8</strong> options
should not be specified because they are used by the wrapper. See the
<strong>xterm</strong> manual page for more information on
<em>xterm-options</em>.</p>
<p>The environment's locale settings (see ENVIRONMENT below) are used to
discern the locale's character set. If no current locale can be
determined, the locale ru_RU.KOI8-R (the Russian language as used in the
territory of Russia, with the KOI8-R character set) is assumed. The
<strong>locale(1)</strong> utility is used to determine whether the
system supports the selected locale. If it does not,
<strong>koi8rxterm</strong> will exit with an error and report the
output of <strong>locale</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: koi8rxterm</strong> may produce unexpected results if
the current locale is set to one in which the KOI8-R character encoding
is not supported, or if fonts using that encoding are not available. In
the Debian system, the xfonts-cyrillic package provides the fonts that
<strong>koi8rxterm</strong> uses by default. To change the fonts
<strong>koi8rxterm</strong> uses, edit the
<em>/etc/X11/app-defaults/KOI8RXTerm</em> file.</p>
<p>A similar wrapper, <strong>uxterm(1),</strong> is available for
Unicode UTF-8 environments.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>LC_ALL, <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong>,
<strong>LANG</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The values of these variables are checked, in order, to determine the
character set used by the current locale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
<p><strong>koi8rxterm</strong> was written by Branden Robinson and is
very heavily based on <strong>uxterm</strong>, by Thomas Dickey. The
assistance of Jurij Smakov was invaluable in sanity-checking its
operation.</p>
