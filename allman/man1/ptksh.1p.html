<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>ptksh - Perl/Tk script to provide a graphical user interface for
testing Perl/Tk commands and scripts.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>% ptksh ?scriptfile? ... version information ... ptksh&gt;
$b=$mw-&gt;Button(-text=&gt;Hi,-command=&gt;sub{print Hi}) ptksh&gt;
$b-&gt;pack ptksh&gt; o $b ... list of options ... ptksh&gt; help ...
help information ... ptksh&gt; exit %</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>ptksh is a perl/Tk shell to enter perl commands interactively. When
one starts ptksh a MainWindow is automatically created, along with a
ptksh command window. One can access the main window by typing commands
using the variable <code>$mw</code> at the 'ptksh&gt; ' prompt of the
command window.</p>
<p>ptksh supports command line editing and history. Just type &lt;Up&gt;
at the command prompt to see a history list. The last 50 commands
entered are saved, then reloaded into history list the next time you
start ptksh.</p>
<p>ptksh supports some convenient commands for inspecting Tk widgets.
See below.</p>
<p>To exit ptksh use: <code>exit</code>.</p>
<p>ptksh is <strong>*not*</strong> a full symbolic debugger. To debug
perl/Tk programs at a low level use the more powerful perl debugger.
(Just enter ``O tk'' on debuggers command line to start the Tk
eventloop.)</p>
<h1>FEATURES</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Press &lt;Up&gt; (the Up Arrow) in the perlwish window to obtain a
gui-based history list. Press &lt;Enter&gt; on any history line to enter
it into the perlwish window. Then hit return. So, for example, repeat
last command is &lt;Up&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;. You can quit the
history window with &lt;Escape&gt;. NOTE: history is only saved if exit
is graceful (i.e. by the exit command from the console or by quitting
all main windowsÎ©-NOT by interrupt).</p>
<h2>Debugging Support</h2>
<p>ptksh provides some convenience function to make browsing in perl/Tk
widget easier:</p>
<dl>
<dt>?, or h</dt>
<dd>
<p>displays a short help summary.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d, or x ?args, ...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dumps recursively arguments to stdout. (see Data::Dumper). You must
have &lt;Data::Dumper&gt; installed to support this feature.
<strong>x</strong> was introduced for perl debugger compatibility.</p>
</dd>
<dt>p ?arg, ...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>appends |\n to each of it's arguments and prints it. If value is
<strong>undef</strong>, '(undef)' is printed to stdout.</p>
</dd>
<dt>o $widget ?-option ...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>prints the option(s) of <em><code>$widget</code></em> one on each
line. If no options are given all options of the widget are listed. See
Tk::options for more details on the format and contents of the returned
list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>o $widget /regexp/</dt>
<dd>
<p>Lists options of <em><code>$widget</code></em> matching the regular
expression <em>regexp</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>u ?class?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If no argument is given it lists the modules loaded by the commands
you executed or since the last time you called <code>u</code>. If
argument is the empty string lists all modules that are loaded by ptksh.
If argument is a string, ``text'' it tries to do a ``use
Tk::Text;''.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>Ptksh compiles into package Tk::ptksh. Your code is eval'ed into
package main. The coolness of this is that your eval code should not
interfere with ptksh itself.</p>
<h2>Multiline Commands</h2>
<p>ptksh will accept multiline commands. Simply put a \ character
immediately before the newline, and ptksh will continue your command
onto the next line.</p>
<h2>Source File Support</h2>
<p>If you have a perl/Tk script that you want to do debugging on, try
running the command</p>
<p>ptksh&gt; do myscript; -- or (at shell command prompt) -- % ptksh
myscript</p>
<p>Then use the perl/Tk commands to try out different operations on your
script.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>Looks for your .ptksh_history in the directory specified by the
<code>$HOME</code> environment variable ($HOMEPATH on Win32
systems).</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt>.ptksh_init</dt>
<dd>
<p>If found in current directory it is read in an evaluated after the
mainwindow <em><code>$mw</code></em> is created. <em>.ptksh_init</em>
can contain any valid perl code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>~/.ptksh_history</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the last 50 lines entered in ptksh session(s).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>PITFALLS</h1>
<p>It is best not to use my in the commands you type into ptksh. For
example my <code>$v</code> will make <code>$v</code> local just to the
command or commands entered until &lt;Return&gt; is pressed. For a
related reason, there are no file-scopy my variables in the ptksh code
itself (else the user might trounce on them by accident).</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p><strong>Tk::MainLoop</strong> function interactively entered or
sourced in a init or script file will block ptksh.</p>
