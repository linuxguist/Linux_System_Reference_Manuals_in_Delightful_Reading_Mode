<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>xcutsel - interchange between cut buffer and selection</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>xcutsel</strong> [ <em>-toolkitoption</em> ...] [-selection
<em>selection</em>] [-cutbuffer <em>number</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>xcutsel</em> program is used to copy the current selection
into a cut buffer and to make a selection that contains the current
contents of the cut buffer. It acts as a bridge between applications
that don't support selections and those that do.</p>
<p>By default, <em>xcutsel</em> will use the selection named PRIMARY and
the cut buffer CUT_BUFFER0. Either or both of these can be overridden by
command line arguments or by resources.</p>
<p>An <em>xcutsel</em> window has the following buttons:</p>
<dl>
<dt> <em>quit</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When this button is pressed, <em>xcutsel</em> exits. Any selections
held by <em>xcutsel</em> are automatically released.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <em>copy PRIMARY to 0</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When this button is pressed, <em>xcutsel</em> copies the current
selection into the cut buffer.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <em>copy 0 to PRIMARY</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When this button is pressed, <em>xcutsel</em> converts the current
contents of the cut buffer into the selection.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The button labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer selected by
command line options or through the resource database.</p>
<p>When the ``copy 0 to PRIMARY'' button is activated, the button will
remain inverted as long as <em>xcutsel</em> remains the owner of the
selection. This serves to remind you which client owns the current
selection. Note that the value of the selection remains constant; if the
cutbuffer is changed, you must again activate the copy button to
retrieve the new value when desired.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><em>Xcutsel</em> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
options as well as the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-selection <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the name of the selection to use. The default
is PRIMARY. The only supported abbreviations for this option are
``-select'', ``-sel'' and ``-s'', as the standard toolkit option
``-selectionTimeout'' has a similar name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-cutbuffer <em>number</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the cut buffer to use. The default is cut
buffer 0.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>X DEFAULTS</h1>
<p>This program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit resource names and
classes as well as:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>selection (<em>class</em>
<strong>Selection)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This resource specifies the name of the selection to use. The default
is PRIMARY.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>cutBuffer (<em>class</em>
<strong>CutBuffer)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This resource specifies the number of the cut buffer to use. The
default is 0.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>WIDGET NAMES</h1>
<p>The following instance names may be used when user configuration of
the labels in them is desired:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>sel-cut (<em>class</em>
<strong>Command)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the ``copy SELECTION to BUFFER'' button.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>cut-sel (<em>class</em>
<strong>Command)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the ``copy BUFFER to SELECTION'' button.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>quit (<em>class</em> <strong>Command)</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the ``quit'' button.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

client documentation for how to make a selection.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>There is no way to change the name of the selection or the number of
the cut buffer while the program is running.</p>
