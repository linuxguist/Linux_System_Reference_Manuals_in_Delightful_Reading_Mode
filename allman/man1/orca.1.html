<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>orca - a scriptable screen reader</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>orca</strong> [<em>option...</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>orca</strong> is a screen reader for people with visual
impairments, it provides alternative access to the desktop by using
speech synthesis and braille.</p>
<p><strong>orca</strong> works with applications and toolkits that
support the Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI),
which is the primary assistive technology infrastructure for Linux and
Solaris. Applications and toolkits supporting the AT-SPI include the
GNOME Gtk+ toolkit, the Java platform's Swing toolkit, LibreOffice,
Gecko, and WebKitGtk. AT-SPI support for the KDE Qt toolkit is being
pursued.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-s, --setup</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When starting <strong>orca</strong>, initiate the GUI-based
configuration.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-u, --user-prefs-dir=</strong><em>dirname</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When starting <strong>orca</strong>, use <em>dirname</em> as an
alternate directory for the user preferences.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-e,
--enable=</strong><em>speech|braille|braille-monitor</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When starting <strong>orca</strong>, force the enabling of the
supplied options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d,
--disable=</strong><em>speech|braille|braille-monitor</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When starting <strong>orca</strong>, force the disabling of the
supplied options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-l, --list-apps</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the names of all the currently running applications. This is
used primarily for debugging purposes to see if <strong>orca</strong>
can talk to the accessibility infrastructure. Note that if
<strong>orca</strong> is already running, this will not kill the other
<strong>orca</strong> process. It will just list the currently running
applications, and you will see <strong>orca</strong> listed twice: once
for the existing <strong>orca</strong> and once for this instance.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--debug</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables debug output for <strong>orca</strong> and sends all debug
output to a file with a name of the form 'debug-YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.out'
in the current directory. The YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS portion will be
replaced with the current date and time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--debug-file=</strong><em>filename</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables debug output for <strong>orca</strong> and sends all debug
output to the given filename.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v, --version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>outputs <strong>orca</strong> version number and exits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-h, --help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>displays <strong>orca</strong> help and exits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--replace</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Replace a currently running <strong>orca</strong> process. By
default, if <strong>orca</strong> detects an existing
<strong>orca</strong> process for the same session, it will not start a
new <strong>orca</strong> process. This option will kill and cleanup
after any existing <strong>orca</strong> process and then start a new
<strong>orca</strong> in its place.</p>
