<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>gpgcompose - Generate a stream of OpenPGP packets</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>gpgcompose</strong> [[<em>OPTION</em> [<em>ARGS</em>]] ...
]</p>
<p><strong>gpgcompose --help</strong></p>
<p><strong>gpgcompose</strong> <em>OPTION</em>
<strong>--help</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>gpgcompose</strong> generates a stream of OpenPGP packets,
including some which can include other nested packets within a layer of
encryption. The syntax on the command line isn't stable enough to
document currently, but additional hints and examples can be found from
the command line using <strong>--help</strong>.</p>
<h1>EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES</h1>
<p><strong>gpgcompose</strong> is not capable of performing secret key
operations on its own. Creation of any OpenPGP object that requires
secret key operations (e.g., <strong>--signature</strong>) will need to
speak to an already-running <strong>gpg-agent</strong>.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>Occasionally, <strong>gpgcompose</strong> will need to look up
existing public keys for reference (e.g.,
<strong>--public-key</strong>). It will do so in
<strong>~/.gnupg/keyring.kbx,</strong> or in
<strong>$GNUPGHOME/keyring.kbx</strong> if that variable is set.</p>
