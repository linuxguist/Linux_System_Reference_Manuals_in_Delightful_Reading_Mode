<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>bogoupgrade - upgrades bogofilter database to current version</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>bogoupgrade</strong> [-h] -d <em>directory</em> [-i <em>input
file</em>] [-o <em>output file</em>] [-b <em>path to bogoutil</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>bogoupgrade</strong> is a command to upgrade bogofilters
databases from an old format to the current format. Since the format of
the database changes once in a while, the utility is designed to make
the upgrade easy.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>-h</strong> option prints the help message and exits.</p>
<p>The <strong>-d</strong> specifies the directory with the wordlists
for converting. This option is used when converting from multiple,
separate wordlists (spamlist.db and goodlist.db - containing spam and
ham tokens, respectively) to a combined wordlist (wordlist.db) which
contains both spam and ham tokens.</p>
<p>The <strong>-i</strong> specifies the input file to be converted. It
should be a text file containing message counts, and possibly data. If
there is no data in the text file, there should be a Berkeley DB file in
the same directory as the text file which contains the data.</p>
<p>The <strong>-o</strong> specifies the output Berkeley DB file.</p>
<p>The <strong>-b</strong> gives the path to the
<strong>bogoutil</strong> command. It defaults to bogoutil, in the hopes
that your shell will find it.</p>
<h1>UPGRADING</h1>
<p>Follow these instructions to upgrade bogofilters databases to the
latest version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Stop all instances of bogofilter. While the upgrade tools lock the
database files, the upgrade may take a long time if you have a busy
site. Dont forget to stop cron jobs or daemons that fetch and process
mail and could fire off bogofilter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Backup your data. Lets assume that you said:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ mv ~/.bogofilter ~/.bogofilter.safe
$ mkdir ~/.bogofilter</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>If your bogofilter version is less than 0.7, say:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ bogoupgrade -i ~/.bogofilter.safe/goodlist -o ~/.bogofilter/goodlist.db
$ bogoupgrade -i ~/.bogofilter.safe/badlist -o ~/.bogofilter/spamlist.db</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If your bogofilter version is 0.7 or greater, say:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ bogoupgrade -i ~/.bogofilter.safe/hamlist.count -o ~/.bogofilter/goodlist.db
$ bogoupgrade -i ~/.bogofilter.safe/spamlist.count -o ~/.bogofilter/spamlist.db</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Current versions of bogofilter use a combined wordlist that holds
both spam and non-spam tokens. It is named wordlist.db. If youre
updating from a version older than 0.14.0 that has separate wordlists
(named goodlist.db and spamlist.db), use:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ bogoupgrade -d ~/.bogofilter.safe</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Done. Restart any stopped daemons, cron tasks, etc.</p>
