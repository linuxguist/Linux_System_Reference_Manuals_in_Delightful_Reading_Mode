<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command allows PKCS#12 files (sometimes referred to as PFX
files) to be created and parsed. PKCS#12 files are used by several
programs including Netscape, MSIE and MS Outlook.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>There are a lot of options the meaning of some depends of whether a
PKCS#12 file is being created or parsed. By default a PKCS#12 file is
parsed. A PKCS#12 file can be created by using the
<strong>-export</strong> option (see below). The PKCS#12 export
encryption and MAC options such as <strong>-certpbe</strong> and
<strong>-iter</strong> and many further options such as
<strong>-chain</strong> are relevant only with <strong>-export</strong>.
Conversely, the options regarding encryption of private keys when
outputting PKCS#12 input are relevant only when the
<strong>-export</strong> option is not given.</p>
<p>The default encryption algorithm is AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2 for key
derivation.</p>
<p>When encountering problems loading legacy PKCS#12 files that involve,
for example, RC2-40-CBC, try using the <strong>-legacy</strong> option
and, if needed, the <strong>-provider-path</strong> option.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-help</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print out a usage message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-passin arg</dt>
<dd>
<p>The password source for the input, and for encrypting any private
keys that are output. For more information about the format of
<strong>arg</strong> see
<strong>openssl-passphrase-options</strong> (1).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-passout arg</dt>
<dd>
<p>The password source for output files.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-password arg</dt>
<dd>
<p>With <strong>-export</strong>, <strong>-password</strong> is
equivalent to <strong>-passout</strong>, otherwise it is equivalent to
<strong>-passin</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-twopass</dt>
<dd>
<p>Prompt for separate integrity and encryption passwords: most software
always assumes these are the same so this option will render such
PKCS#12 files unreadable. Cannot be used in combination with the options
<strong>-password</strong>, <strong>-passin</strong> if importing from
PKCS#12, or <strong>-passout</strong> if exporting.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-nokeys</dt>
<dd>
<p>No private keys will be output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-nocerts</dt>
<dd>
<p>No certificates will be output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-noout</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option inhibits all credentials output, and so the input is just
verified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-legacy</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use legacy mode of operation and automatically load the legacy
provider. If OpenSSL is not installed system-wide, it is necessary to
also use, for example, <code>-provider-path ./providers</code> or to set
the environment variable <strong>OPENSSL_MODULES</strong> to point to
the directory where the providers can be found. In the legacy mode, the
default algorithm for certificate encryption is RC2_CBC or 3DES_CBC
depending on whether the RC2 cipher is enabled in the build. The default
algorithm for private key encryption is 3DES_CBC. If the legacy option
is not specified, then the legacy provider is not loaded and the default
encryption algorithm for both certificates and private keys is
AES_256_CBC with PBKDF2 for key derivation.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<h2>PKCS#12 output (export) options</h2>
<dl>
<dt>-export</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies that a PKCS#12 file will be created rather than
parsed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-out filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies filename to write the PKCS#12 file to. Standard output
is used by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-in filename|uri</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the input filename or URI. Standard input is used by
default. With the <strong>-export</strong> option this is a file with
certificates and a key, or a URI that refers to a key accessed via an
engine. The order of credentials in a file doesn't matter but one
private key and its corresponding certificate should be present. If
additional certificates are present they will also be included in the
PKCS#12 output file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-inkey filename|uri</dt>
<dd>
<p>The private key input for PKCS12 output. If this option is not
specified then the input file (<strong>-in</strong> argument) must
contain a private key. If no engine is used, the argument is taken as a
file. If the <strong>-engine</strong> option is used or the URI has
prefix <code>org.openssl.engine:</code> then the rest of the URI is
taken as key identifier for the given engine.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-certfile filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>An input file with extra certificates to be added to the PKCS#12
output if the <strong>-export</strong> option is given.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-passcerts arg</dt>
<dd>
<p>The password source for certificate input such as
<strong>-certfile</strong> and <strong>-untrusted</strong>. For more
information about the format of <strong>arg</strong> see
<strong>openssl-passphrase-options</strong> (1).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-chain</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is present then the certificate chain of the end
entity certificate is built and included in the PKCS#12 output file. The
end entity certificate is the first one read from the
<strong>-in</strong> file if no key is given, else the first certificate
matching the given key. The standard CA trust store is used for chain
building, as well as any untrusted CA certificates given with the
<strong>-untrusted</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-untrusted filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>An input file of untrusted certificates that may be used for chain
building, which is relevant only when a PKCS#12 file is created with the
<strong>-export</strong> option and the <strong>-chain</strong> option
is given as well. Any certificates that are actually part of the chain
are added to the output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-CAfile file, -no-CAfile, -CApath dir, -no-CApath, -CAstore uri,
-no-CAstore</dt>
<dd>
<p>See Trusted Certificate Options in
<strong>openssl-verification-options</strong> (1) for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-name friendlyname</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the friendly name for the certificates and private
key. This name is typically displayed in list boxes by software
importing the file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-caname friendlyname</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the friendly name for other certificates. This option
may be used multiple times to specify names for all certificates in the
order they appear. Netscape ignores friendly names on other certificates
whereas MSIE displays them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-CSP name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write <em>name</em> as a Microsoft CSP name. The password source for
the input, and for encrypting any private keys that are output. For more
information about the format of <strong>arg</strong> see
<strong>openssl-passphrase-options</strong> (1).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-LMK</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add the Local Key Set identifier to the attributes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-keyex|-keysig</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the private key is to be used for key exchange or just
signing. This option is only interpreted by MSIE and similar MS
software. Normally export grade software will only allow 512 bit RSA
keys to be used for encryption purposes but arbitrary length keys for
signing. The <strong>-keysig</strong> option marks the key for signing
only. Signing only keys can be used for S/MIME signing, authenticode
(ActiveX control signing) and SSL client authentication, however, due to
a bug only MSIE 5.0 and later support the use of signing only keys for
SSL client authentication.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-keypbe alg, -certpbe alg</dt>
<dd>
<p>These options allow the algorithm used to encrypt the private key and
certificates to be selected. Any PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 PBE algorithm
name can be used (see NOTES section for more information). If a cipher
name (as output by <code>openssl list -cipher-algorithms</code>) is
specified then it is used with PKCS#5 v2.0. For interoperability reasons
it is advisable to only use PKCS#12 algorithms. Special value
<code>NONE</code> disables encryption of the private key and
certificates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-descert</dt>
<dd>
<p>Encrypt the certificates using triple DES. By default the private key
and the certificates are encrypted using AES-256-CBC unless the
'-legacy' option is used. If '-descert' is used with the '-legacy' then
both, the private key and the certificates are encrypted using triple
DES.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-macalg digest</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the MAC digest algorithm. If not included SHA256 will be
used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-iter count</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the iteration count for the encryption key and
MAC. The default value is 2048. To discourage attacks by using large
dictionaries of common passwords the algorithm that derives keys from
passwords can have an iteration count applied to it: this causes a
certain part of the algorithm to be repeated and slows it down. The MAC
is used to check the file integrity but since it will normally have the
same password as the keys and certificates it could also be
attacked.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-noiter, -nomaciter</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default both encryption and MAC iteration counts are set to 2048,
using these options the MAC and encryption iteration counts can be set
to 1, since this reduces the file security you should not use these
options unless you really have to. Most software supports both MAC and
encryption iteration counts. MSIE 4.0 doesn't support MAC iteration
counts so it needs the <strong>-nomaciter</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-maciter</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is included for compatibility with previous versions, it
used to be needed to use MAC iterations counts but they are now used by
default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-nomac</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not attempt to provide the MAC integrity. This can be useful with
the FIPS provider as the PKCS12 MAC requires PKCS12KDF which is not an
approved FIPS algorithm and cannot be supported by the FIPS
provider.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Although there are a large number of options most of them are very
rarely used. For PKCS#12 file parsing only <strong>-in</strong> and
<strong>-out</strong> need to be used for PKCS#12 file creation
<strong>-export</strong> and <strong>-name</strong> are also used.</p>
<p>If none of the <strong>-clcerts</strong>, <strong>-cacerts</strong>
or <strong>-nocerts</strong> options are present then all certificates
will be output in the order they appear in the input PKCS#12 files.
There is no guarantee that the first certificate present is the one
corresponding to the private key. Certain software which tries to get a
private key and the corresponding certificate might assume that the
first certificate in the file is the one corresponding to the private
key, but that may not always be the case. Using the
<strong>-clcerts</strong> option will solve this problem by only
outputting the certificate corresponding to the private key. If the CA
certificates are required then they can be output to a separate file
using the <strong>-nokeys</strong> <strong>-cacerts</strong> options to
just output CA certificates.</p>
<p>The <strong>-keypbe</strong> and <strong>-certpbe</strong> algorithms
allow the precise encryption algorithms for private keys and
certificates to be specified. Normally the defaults are fine but
occasionally software can't handle triple DES encrypted private keys,
then the option <strong>-keypbe</strong> <em>PBE-SHA1-RC2-40</em> can be
used to reduce the private key encryption to 40 bit RC2. A complete
description of all algorithms is contained in
<strong>openssl-pkcs8</strong> (1).</p>
<p>Prior 1.1 release passwords containing non-ASCII characters were
encoded in non-compliant manner, which limited interoperability, in
first hand with Windows. But switching to standard-compliant password
encoding poses problem accessing old data protected with broken
encoding. For this reason even legacy encodings is attempted when
reading the data. If you use PKCS#12 files in production application you
are advised to convert the data, because implemented heuristic approach
is not MT-safe, its sole goal is to facilitate the data upgrade with
this command.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
