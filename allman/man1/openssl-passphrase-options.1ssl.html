<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>openssl-passphrase-options - Pass phrase options</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>openssl</strong> <em>command</em> [ <em>options</em> ... ] [
<em>parameters</em> ... ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Several OpenSSL commands accept password arguments, typically using
<strong>-passin</strong> and <strong>-passout</strong> for input and
output passwords respectively. These allow the password to be obtained
from a variety of sources. Both of these options take a single argument
whose format is described below. If no password argument is given and a
password is required then the user is prompted to enter one: this will
typically be read from the current terminal with echoing turned off.</p>
<p>Note that character encoding may be relevant, please see
<strong>passphrase-encoding</strong>â€†(7).</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<h2>Pass Phrase Option Arguments</h2>
<p>Pass phrase arguments can be formatted as follows.</p>
<dl>
<dt>pass:password</dt>
<dd>
<p>The actual password is <em>password</em>. Since the password is
visible to utilities (like 'ps' under Unix) this form should only be
used where security is not important.</p>
</dd>
<dt>env:var</dt>
<dd>
<p>Obtain the password from the environment variable <em>var</em>. Since
the environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms (e.g.
ps under certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with caution.</p>
</dd>
<dt>file:pathname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The first line of <em>pathname</em> is the password. If the same
<em>pathname</em> argument is supplied to <strong>-passin</strong> and
<strong>-passout</strong> arguments then the first line will be used for
the input password and the next line for the output password.
<em>pathname</em> need not refer to a regular file: it could for example
refer to a device or named pipe.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fd:number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Read the password from the file descriptor <em>number</em>. This can
be used to send the data via a pipe for example.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stdin</dt>
<dd>
<p>Read the password from standard input.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
