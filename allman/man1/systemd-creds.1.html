<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-creds - Lists, shows, encrypts and decrypts service
credentials</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-creds</strong> [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [ARGS...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-creds</strong> is a tool for listing, showing,
encrypting and decrypting unit credentials. Credentials are limited-size
binary or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes. They are
primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and private)
or certificates, user account information or identity information from
the host to services.</p>
<p>Credentials are configured in unit files via the
<em>LoadCredential=</em>, <em>SetCredential=</em>,
<em>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</em> and <em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em>
settings, see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) for details.</p>
<p>For further information see <strong>System and Service
Credentials</strong>[1] documentation.</p>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<p>The following commands are understood:</p>
<p><strong>list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show a list of credentials passed into the current execution context.
This command shows the files in the directory referenced by the
<em>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</em> environment variable, and is intended to
be executed from within service context.</p>
<p>Along with each credential name, the size and security state is
shown. The latter is one of "secure" (in case the credential is backed
by unswappable memory, i.e. "ramfs"), "weak" (in case it is backed by
any other type of memory), or "insecure" (if having any access mode that
is not 0400, i.e. if readable by anyone but the owner).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>cat</strong> <em>credential...</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show contents of specified credentials passed into the current
execution context. Takes one or more credential names, whose contents
shall be written to standard output.</p>
<p>When combined with <strong>--json=</strong> or
<strong>--transcode=</strong> the output is transcoded in simple ways
before outputting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>setup</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generates a host encryption key for credentials, if one has not been
generated already. This ensures the /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret
file is initialized with a random secret key if it doesnt exist yet.
This secret key is used when encrypting/decrypting credentials with
<strong>encrypt</strong> or <strong>decrypt</strong>, and is only
accessible to the root user. Note that theres typically no need to
invoke this command explicitly as it is implicitly called when
<strong>encrypt</strong> is invoked, and credential host key encryption
selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>encrypt</strong> <em>input|-</em> <em>output|-</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loads the specified (unencrypted plaintext) input credential file,
encrypts it and writes the (encrypted ciphertext) output to the
specified target credential file. The resulting file may be referenced
in the <em>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</em> setting in unit files, or its
contents used literally in <em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em>
settings.</p>
<p>Takes two file system paths. The file name part of the output path is
embedded as name in the encrypted credential, to ensure encrypted
credentials cannot be renamed and reused for different purposes without
this being noticed. The credential name to embed may be overridden with
the <strong>--name=</strong> setting. The input or output paths may be
specified as "-", in which case the credential data is read from/written
to standard input and standard output. If the output path is specified
as "-" the credential name cannot be derived from the file system path,
and thus should be specified explicitly via the <strong>--name=</strong>
switch.</p>
<p>The credential data is encrypted and authenticated symmetrically with
one of the following encryption keys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>A secret key automatically derived from the systems TPM2 chip. This
encryption key is not stored on the host system and thus decryption is
only possible with access to the original TPM2 chip. Or in other words,
the credential secured in this way can only be decrypted again by the
local machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>A secret key stored in the /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret file
which is only accessible to the root user. This "host" encryption key is
stored on the host file system, and thus decryption is possible with
access to the host file system and sufficient privileges. The key is
automatically generated when needed, but can also be created explicitly
with the <strong>setup</strong> command, see above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>A combination of the above: an encryption key derived from both the
TPM2 chip and the host file system. This means decryption requires both
access to the original TPM2 chip and the OS installation. This is the
default mode of operation if a TPM2 chip is available and
/var/lib/systemd/ resides on persistent media.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which of the three keys shall be used for encryption may be
configured with the <strong>--with-key=</strong> switch. Depending on
the use-case for the encrypted credential the key to use may differ. For
example, for credentials that shall be accessible from the initrd,
encryption with the host key is not appropriate, since access to the
host key is typically not available from the initrd. Thus, for such
credentials only the TPM2 key should be used.</p>
<p>Encrypted credentials are always encoded in Base64.</p>
<p>Use <strong>decrypt</strong> (see below) to undo the encryption
operation, and acquire the decrypted plaintext credential from the
encrypted ciphertext credential.</p>
<p>The credential data is encrypted using AES256-GCM, i.e. providing
both confidentiality and integrity, keyed by a SHA256 hash of one or
both of the secret keys described above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>decrypt</strong> <em>input|-</em> [<em>output|-</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undoes the effect of the <strong>encrypt</strong> operation: loads
the specified (encrypted ciphertext) input credential file, decrypts and
authenticates it and writes the (decrypted plaintext) output to the
specified target credential file.</p>
<p>Takes one or two file system paths. The file name part of the input
path is compared with the credential name embedded in the encrypted
file. If it does not match decryption fails. This is done in order to
ensure that encrypted credentials are not re-purposed without this being
detected. The credential name to compare with the embedded credential
name may also be overridden with the <strong>--name=</strong> switch. If
the input path is specified as "-", the encrypted credential is read
from standard input. If only one path is specified or the output path
specified as "-", the decrypted credential is written to standard
output. In this mode, the expected name embedded in the credential
cannot be derived from the path and should be specified explicitly with
<strong>--name=</strong>.</p>
<p>Decrypting credentials requires access to the original TPM2 chip
and/or credentials host key, see above. Information about which keys are
required is embedded in the encrypted credential data, and thus
decryption is entirely automatic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>has-tpm2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reports whether the system is equipped with a TPM2 device usable for
protecting credentials. If a TPM2 device has been discovered, is
supported, and is being used by firmware, by the OS kernel drivers and
by userspace (i.e. systemd) this prints "yes" and exits with exit status
zero. If no such device is discovered/supported/used, prints "no".
Otherwise prints "partial". In either of these two cases exits with
non-zero exit status. It also shows four lines indicating separately
whether firmware, drivers, the system and the kernel
discovered/support/use TPM2.</p>
<p>Combine with <strong>--quiet</strong> to suppress the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>--system</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>list</strong> and
<strong>cat</strong> commands operates on the credentials passed to
system as a whole instead of on those passed to the current execution
context. This is useful in container environments where credentials may
be passed in from the container manager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--transcode=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>cat</strong> or
<strong>decrypt</strong> commands, transcodes the output before showing
it. Takes one of "base64", "unbase64", "hex" or "unhex" as argument, in
order to encode/decode the credential data with Base64 or as series of
hexadecimal values.</p>
<p>Note that this has no effect on the <strong>encrypt</strong> command,
as encrypted credentials are unconditionally encoded in Base64.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--newline=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with <strong>cat</strong> or <strong>decrypt</strong>
controls whether to add a trailing newline character to the end of the
output if it doesnt end in one, anyway. Takes one of "auto", "yes" or
"no". The default mode of "auto" will suffix the output with a single
newline character only when writing credential data to a TTY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--pretty</strong>, <strong>-p</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with <strong>encrypt</strong> controls whether to show
the encrypted credential as <em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em> setting
that may be pasted directly into a unit file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--name=</strong><em>name</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the
credential name to embed in the encrypted credential data. If not
specified the name is chosen automatically from the filename component
of the specified output path. If specified as empty string no credential
name is embedded in the encrypted credential, and no verification of
credential name is done when the credential is decrypted.</p>
<p>When specified with the <strong>decrypt</strong> command control the
credential name to validate the credential name embedded in the
encrypted credential with. If not specified the name is chosen
automatically from the filename component of the specified input path.
If no credential name is embedded in the encrypted credential file (i.e.
the <strong>--name=</strong> with an empty string was used when
encrypted) the specified name has no effect as no credential name
validation is done.</p>
<p>Embedding the credential name in the encrypted credential is done in
order to protect against reuse of credentials for purposes they werent
originally intended for, under the assumption the credential name is
chosen carefully to encode its intended purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--timestamp=</strong><em>timestamp</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the
timestamp to embed into the encrypted credential. Defaults to the
current time. Takes a timestamp specification in the format described in
<strong>systemd.time</strong>(7).</p>
<p>When specified with the <strong>decrypt</strong> command controls the
timestamp to use to validate the "not-after" timestamp that was
configured with <strong>--not-after=</strong> during encryption. If not
specified defaults to the current system time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--not-after=</strong><em>timestamp</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the
time when the credential shall not be used anymore. This embeds the
specified timestamp in the encrypted credential. During decryption the
timestamp is checked against the current system clock, and if the
timestamp is in the past the decryption will fail. By default no such
timestamp is set. Takes a timestamp specification in the format
described in <strong>systemd.time</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--with-key=</strong>, <strong>-H</strong>,
<strong>-T</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the
encryption/signature key to use. Takes one of "host", "tpm2",
"host+tpm2", "tpm2-absent", "auto", "auto-initrd". See above for details
on the three key types. If set to "auto" (which is the default) the TPM2
key is used if a TPM2 device is found and not running in a container.
The host key is used if /var/lib/systemd/ is on persistent media. This
means on typical systems the encryption is by default bound to both the
TPM2 chip and the OS installation, and both need to be available to
decrypt the credential again. If "auto" is selected but neither TPM2 is
available (or running in container) nor /var/lib/systemd/ is on
persistent media, encryption will fail. If set to "tpm2-absent" a fixed
zero length key is used (thus, in this mode no confidentiality nor
authenticity are provided!). This logic is useful to cover for systems
that lack a TPM2 chip but where credentials shall be generated. Note
that decryption of such credentials is refused on systems that have a
TPM2 chip and where UEFI SecureBoot is enabled (this is done so that
such a locked down system cannot be tricked into loading a credential
generated this way that lacks authentication information). If set to
"auto-initrd" a TPM2 key is used if a TPM2 is found. If not a fixed zero
length key is used, equivalent to "tpm2-absent" mode. This option is
particularly useful to generate credentials files that are
encrypted/authenticated against TPM2 where available but still work on
systems lacking support for this.</p>
<p>The <strong>-H</strong> switch is a shortcut for
<strong>--with-key=host</strong>. Similar, <strong>-T</strong> is a
shortcut for <strong>--with-key=tpm2</strong>.</p>
<p>When encrypting credentials that shall be used in the initrd (where
/var/lib/systemd/ is typically not available) make sure to use
<strong>--with-key=auto-initrd</strong> mode, to disable binding against
the host secret.</p>
<p>This switch has no effect on the <strong>decrypt</strong> command, as
information on which key to use for decryption is included in the
encrypted credential already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-device=</strong><em>PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls the TPM2 device to use. Expects a device node path referring
to the TPM2 chip (e.g. /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value
"auto" may be specified, in order to automatically determine the device
node of a suitable TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one). The
special value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2 devices
currently discovered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong> [PCR...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the TPM2 PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) to bind
the encryption key to. Takes a "+" separated list of numeric PCR indexes
in the range 0...23. If not used, defaults to PCR 7 only. If an empty
string is specified, binds the encryption key to no PCRs at all. For
details about the PCRs available, see the documentation of the switch of
the same name for <strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong>(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-public-key=</strong> [PATH],
<strong>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong> [PCR...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures a TPM2 signed PCR policy to bind encryption to, for use
with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command. The
<strong>--tpm2-public-key=</strong> option accepts a path to a PEM
encoded RSA public key, to bind the encryption to. If this is not
specified explicitly, but a file tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem exists in one
of the directories /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/
(searched in this order), it is automatically used. The
<strong>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong> option takes a list of TPM2 PCR
indexes to bind to (same syntax as <strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong>
described above). If not specified defaults to 11 (i.e. this binds the
policy to any unified kernel image for which a PCR signature can be
provided).</p>
<p>Note the difference between <strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong> and
<strong>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong>: the former binds decryption to
the current, specific PCR values; the latter binds decryption to any set
of PCR values for which a signature by the specified public key can be
provided. The latter is hence more useful in scenarios where software
updates shall be possible without losing access to all previously
encrypted secrets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-signature=</strong> [PATH]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a TPM2 PCR signature file as generated by the
<strong>systemd-measure</strong>(1) tool and that may be used to allow
the <strong>decrypt</strong> command to decrypt credentials that are
bound to specific signed PCR values. If this this is not specified
explicitly, and a credential with a signed PCR policy is attempted to be
decrypted, a suitable signature file tpm2-pcr-signature.json is searched
for in /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/ (in this order)
and used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--quiet</strong>, <strong>-q</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used with <strong>has-tpm2</strong> suppresses the output, and
only returns an exit status indicating support for TPM2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-legend</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with
hints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--json=</strong><em>MODE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the
shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace or line
breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>On success, 0 is returned.</p>
<p>In case of the <strong>has-tpm2</strong> command returns 0 if a TPM2
device is discovered, supported and used by firmware, driver, and
userspace (i.e. systemd). Otherwise returns the OR combination of the
value 1 (in case firmware support is missing), 2 (in case driver support
is missing) and 4 (in case userspace support is missing). If no TPM2
support is available at all, value 7 is hence returned.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>Example 1. Encrypt a password for use as
credential</strong></p>
<p>The following command line encrypts the specified password "hunter2",
writing the result to a file password.cred.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># echo -n hunter2 | systemd-creds encrypt - password.cred</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This decrypts the file password.cred again, revealing the literal
password:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># systemd-creds decrypt password.cred
hunter2</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2. Encrypt a password and include it in a unit
file</strong></p>
<p>The following command line prompts the user for a password and
generates a <em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em> line from it for a
credential named "mysql-password", suitable for inclusion in a unit
file.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># systemd-ask-password -n | systemd-creds encrypt --name=mysql-password -p - -
🔐 Password: ****
SetCredentialEncrypted=mysql-password: \
        k6iUCUh0RJCQyvL8k8q1UyAAAAABAAAADAAAABAAAAASfFsBoPLIm/dlDoGAAAAAAAAAA \
        NAAAAAgAAAAAH4AILIOZ3w6rTzYsBy9G7liaCAd4i+Kpvs8mAgArzwuKxd0ABDjgSeO5k \

</blockquote>
<p>The generated line can be pasted 1:1 into a unit file, and will
ensure the acquired password will be made available in the
<em>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</em>/mysql-password credential file for the
started service.</p>
<p>Utilizing the unit file drop-in logic this can be used to securely
pass a password credential to a unit. A similar, more comprehensive set
of commands to insert a password into a service xyz.service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/xyz.service.d
# systemd-ask-password -n | ( echo &quot;[Service]&quot; &amp;&amp; systemd-creds encrypt --name=mysql-password -p - - ) &gt; /etc/systemd/system/xyz.service.d/50-password.conf
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart xyz.service</code></pre>
