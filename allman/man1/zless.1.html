<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>zless</strong> [ name ... ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>zless</strong> command is a filter which allows
examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on
a soft-copy terminal. It is the equivalent of setting the environment
variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- %s', and the environment variable
LESSMETACHARS to
'&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;;*?"()&lt;&gt;[|&amp;^`#\$%=~',
and then running <strong>less</strong>. However, enough people seem to
think that having the command <strong>zless</strong> available is
important to be worth providing it.</p>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p><strong>zmore</strong>(1), <strong>less</strong>(1)</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>The <strong>zless</strong> command does not work with compressed data
that is piped to it via standard input; it requires that input files be
specified as arguments. To read compressed data from a pipe, you can use
. . .<strong>|gunzip|less</strong> instead of
. . .<strong>|zless</strong>.</p>
