<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. For an
introduction to programming in Python, see the Python Tutorial. The
Python Library Reference documents built-in and standard types,
constants, functions and modules. Finally, the Python Reference Manual
describes the syntax and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too)
much detail. (These documents may be located via the <strong>INTERNET
RESOURCES</strong> below; they may be installed on your system as
well.)</p>
<p>Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in
C or C++. On most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded. Python
is also adaptable as an extension language for existing applications.
See the internal documentation for hints.</p>
<p>Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be viewed
by running the <strong>pydoc</strong> program.</p>
<h1>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-B</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Don't write <em>.pyc</em> files on import. See also
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-b</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance) and
comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue errors)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-c </strong><em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the command to execute (see next section). This terminates
the option list (following options are passed as arguments to the
command).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--check-hash-based-pycs </strong><em>mode</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Configure how Python evaluates the up-to-dateness of hash-based .pyc
files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Turn on parser debugging output (for expert only, depending on
compilation options).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-E</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that
modify the behavior of the interpreter.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-h , -? , --help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--help-env</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints help about Python-specific environment variables and
exits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--help-xoptions</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints help about implementation-specific <strong>-X</strong> options
and exits.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--help-all</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints complete usage information and exits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-i</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a script is passed as first argument or the <strong>-c</strong>
option is used, enter interactive mode after executing the script or the
command. It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP file. This can be useful to
inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an
exception.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-I</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run Python in isolated mode. This also implies <strong>-E</strong>,
<strong>-P</strong> and <strong>-s</strong>. In isolated mode sys.path
contains neither the script's directory nor the user's site-packages
directory. All PYTHON* environment variables are ignored, too. Further
restrictions may be imposed to prevent the user from injecting malicious
code.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-m </strong><em>module-name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Searches <em>sys.path</em> for the named module and runs the
corresponding <em>.py</em> file as a script. This terminates the option
list (following options are passed as arguments to the module).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-O</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove assert statements and any code conditional on the value of
__debug__; augment the filename for compiled (bytecode) files by adding
.opt-1 before the .pyc extension.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-OO</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Do <strong>-O</strong> and also discard docstrings; change the
filename for compiled (bytecode) files by adding .opt-2 before the .pyc
extension.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-P</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Don't automatically prepend a potentially unsafe path to
<strong>sys.path</strong> such as the current directory, the script's
directory or an empty string. See also the
<strong>PYTHONSAFEPATH</strong> environment variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-q</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not print the version and copyright messages. These messages are
also suppressed in non-interactive mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-s</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Don't add user site directory to sys.path.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-S</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable the import of the module <em>site</em> and the site-dependent
manipulations of <em>sys.path</em> that it entails. Also disable these
manipulations if <em>site</em> is explicitly imported later.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-u</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Force the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered. This option has
no effect on the stdin stream.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place
(filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded. When given twice,
print a message for each file that is checked for when searching for a
module. Also provides information on module cleanup at exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V , --version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the Python version number of the executable and exits. When
given twice, print more information about the build.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-W </strong><em>argument</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Warning control. Python's warning machinery by default prints warning
messages to <em>sys.stderr</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest settings apply a particular action unconditionally to
all warnings emitted by a process (even those that are otherwise ignored
by default):</p>
<p>-Wdefault # Warn once per call location -Werror # Convert to
exceptions -Walways # Warn every time -Wmodule # Warn once per calling
module -Wonce # Warn once per Python process -Wignore # Never warn</p>
<p>The action names can be abbreviated as desired and the interpreter
will resolve them to the appropriate action name. For example,
<strong>-Wi</strong> is the same as <strong>-Wignore .</strong></p>
<p>The full form of argument is:
<em>action:message:category:module:lineno</em></p>
<p>Empty fields match all values; trailing empty fields may be omitted.
For example <strong>-W ignore::DeprecationWarning</strong> ignores all
DeprecationWarning warnings.</p>
<p>The <em>action</em> field is as explained above but only applies to
warnings that match the remaining fields.</p>
<p>The <em>message</em> field must match the whole printed warning
message; this match is case-insensitive.</p>
<p>The <em>category</em> field matches the warning category (ex:
"DeprecationWarning"). This must be a class name; the match test whether
the actual warning category of the message is a subclass of the
specified warning category.</p>
<p>The <em>module</em> field matches the (fully-qualified) module name;
this match is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>The <em>lineno</em> field matches the line number, where zero matches
all line numbers and is thus equivalent to an omitted line number.</p>
<p>Multiple <strong>-W</strong> options can be given; when a warning
matches more than one option, the action for the last matching option is
performed. Invalid <strong>-W</strong> options are ignored (though, a
warning message is printed about invalid options when the first warning
is issued).</p>
<p>Warnings can also be controlled using the
<strong>PYTHONWARNINGS</strong> environment variable and from within a
Python program using the warnings module. For example, the
warnings.filterwarnings() function can be used to use a regular
expression on the warning message.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-X </strong><em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set implementation-specific option. The following options are
available:</p>
<p>-X faulthandler: enable faulthandler</p>
<p>-X showrefcount: output the total reference count and number of used
memory blocks when the program finishes or after each statement in the
interactive interpreter. This only works on debug builds</p>
<p>-X tracemalloc: start tracing Python memory allocations using the
tracemalloc module. By default, only the most recent frame is stored in
a traceback of a trace. Use -X tracemalloc=NFRAME to start tracing with
a traceback limit of NFRAME frames</p>
<p>-X importtime: show how long each import takes. It shows module name,
cumulative time (including nested imports) and self time (excluding
nested imports). Note that its output may be broken in multi-threaded
application. Typical usage is python3 -X importtime -c 'import
asyncio'</p>
<p>-X dev: enable CPython's "development mode", introducing additional
runtime checks which are too expensive to be enabled by default. It will
not be more verbose than the default if the code is correct: new
warnings are only emitted when an issue is detected. Effect of the
developer mode: * Add default warning filter, as -W default * Install
debug hooks on memory allocators: see the PyMem_SetupDebugHooks() C
function * Enable the faulthandler module to dump the Python traceback
on a crash * Enable asyncio debug mode * Set the dev_mode attribute of
sys.flags to True * io.IOBase destructor logs close() exceptions</p>
<p>-X utf8: enable UTF-8 mode for operating system interfaces,
overriding the default locale-aware mode. -X utf8=0 explicitly disables
UTF-8 mode (even when it would otherwise activate automatically). See
PYTHONUTF8 for more details</p>
<p>-X pycache_prefix=PATH: enable writing .pyc files to a parallel tree
rooted at the given directory instead of to the code tree.</p>
<p>-X warn_default_encoding: enable opt-in EncodingWarning for
'encoding=None'</p>
<p>-X no_debug_ranges: disable the inclusion of the tables mapping extra
location information (end line, start column offset and end column
offset) to every instruction in code objects. This is useful when
smaller code objects and pyc files are desired as well as suppressing
the extra visual location indicators when the interpreter displays
tracebacks.</p>
<p>-X frozen_modules=[on|off]: whether or not frozen modules should be
used. The default is "on" (or "off" if you are running a local
build).</p>
<p>-X int_max_str_digits=number: limit the size of int&lt;-&gt;str
conversions. This helps avoid denial of service attacks when parsing
untrusted data. The default is sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits. 0
disables.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-x</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Skip the first line of the source. This is intended for a DOS
specific hack only. Warning: the line numbers in error messages will be
off by one!</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>INTERPRETER INTERFACE</h1>
<p>The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell: when
called with standard input connected to a tty device, it prompts for
commands and executes them until an EOF is read; when called with a file
name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a
<em>script</em> from that file; when called with <strong>-c</strong>
<em>command</em>, it executes the Python statement(s) given as
<em>command</em>. Here <em>command</em> may contain multiple statements
separated by newlines. Leading whitespace is significant in Python
statements! In non-interactive mode, the entire input is parsed before
it is executed.</p>
<p>If available, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are
passed to the script in the Python variable <em>sys.argv</em>, which is
a list of strings (you must first <em>import sys</em> to be able to
access it). If no script name is given, <em>sys.argv[0]</em> is an empty
string; if <strong>-c</strong> is used, <em>sys.argv[0]</em> contains
the string <em>'-c'.</em> Note that options interpreted by the Python
interpreter itself are not placed in <em>sys.argv</em>.</p>
<p>In interactive mode, the primary prompt is `&gt;&gt;&gt;'; the second
prompt (which appears when a command is not complete) is `...'. The
prompts can be changed by assignment to <em>sys.ps1</em> or
<em>sys.ps2</em>. The interpreter quits when it reads an EOF at a
prompt. When an unhandled exception occurs, a stack trace is printed and
control returns to the primary prompt; in non-interactive mode, the
interpreter exits after printing the stack trace. The interrupt signal
raises the <em>KeyboardInterrupt</em> exception; other UNIX signals are
not caught (except that SIGPIPE is sometimes ignored, in favor of the
<em>IOError</em> exception). Error messages are written to stderr.</p>
<h1>FILES AND DIRECTORIES</h1>
<p>These are subject to difference depending on local installation
conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent and
should be interpreted as for GNU software; they may be the same. On
Debian GNU/{Hurd,Linux} the default for both is <em>/usr</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>${exec_prefix}/bin/python</dt>
<dd>
<p>Recommended location of the interpreter.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;</em><br />
<em>${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommended locations of the directories containing the standard
modules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>${prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;</em><br />
<em>${exec_prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommended locations of the directories containing the include files
needed for developing Python extensions and embedding the
interpreter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h1>
<dl>
<dt>PYTHONSAFEPATH</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string, don't automatically prepend a
potentially unsafe path to <strong>sys.path</strong> such as the current
directory, the script's directory or an empty string. See also the
<strong>-P</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONHOME</dt>
<dd>
<p>Change the location of the standard Python libraries. By default, the
libraries are searched in ${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt; and
${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;, where ${prefix} and
${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent directories, both defaulting
to <em>/usr/local</em>. When $PYTHONHOME is set to a single directory,
its value replaces both ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}. To specify
different values for these, set $PYTHONHOME to
${prefix}:${exec_prefix}.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONPATH</dt>
<dd>
<p>Augments the default search path for module files. The format is the
same as the shell's $PATH: one or more directory pathnames separated by
colons. Non-existent directories are silently ignored. The default
search path is installation dependent, but generally begins with
${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt; (see PYTHONHOME above). The default
search path is always appended to $PYTHONPATH. If a script argument is
given, the directory containing the script is inserted in the path in
front of $PYTHONPATH. The search path can be manipulated from within a
Python program as the variable <em>sys.path</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONPLATLIBDIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Override sys.platlibdir.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONSTARTUP</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that
file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in interactive
mode. The file is executed in the same name space where interactive
commands are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can be
used without qualification in the interactive session. You can also
change the prompts <em>sys.ps1</em> and <em>sys.ps2</em> in this
file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONOPTIMIZE</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the <strong>-O</strong> option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent
to specifying <strong>-O</strong> multiple times.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONDEBUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the <strong>-d</strong> option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent
to specifying <strong>-d</strong> multiple times.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the <strong>-B</strong> option (don't try to write <em>.pyc</em>
files).</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONINSPECT</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the <strong>-i</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONIOENCODING</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set before running the interpreter, it overrides the
encoding used for stdin/stdout/stderr, in the syntax
<em>encodingname</em><strong>:</strong><em>errorhandler</em> The
<em>errorhandler</em> part is optional and has the same meaning as in
str.encode. For stderr, the <em>errorhandler</em> part is ignored; the
handler will always be 'backslashreplace'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONNOUSERSITE</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the <strong>-s</strong> option (Don't add the user site directory to
sys.path).</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the <strong>-u</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONVERBOSE</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying
the <strong>-v</strong> option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent
to specifying <strong>-v</strong> multiple times.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONWARNINGS</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set to a comma-separated string it is equivalent to
specifying the <strong>-W</strong> option for each separate value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONHASHSEED</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this variable is set to "random", a random value is used to seed
the hashes of str and bytes objects.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed
seed for generating the hash() of the types covered by the hash
randomization. Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as for
selftests for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python
processes to share hash values.</p>
<p>The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295].
Specifying the value 0 will disable hash randomization.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Limit the maximum digit characters in an int value when converting
from a string and when converting an int back to a str. A value of 0
disables the limit. Conversions to or from bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are
never limited.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONMALLOC</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the Python memory allocators and/or install debug hooks. The
available memory allocators are <em>malloc</em> and <em>pymalloc</em>.
The available debug hooks are <em>debug</em>, <em>malloc_debug</em>, and
<em>pymalloc_debug</em>.</p>
<p>When Python is compiled in debug mode, the default is
<em>pymalloc_debug</em> and the debug hooks are automatically used.
Otherwise, the default is <em>pymalloc</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONMALLOCSTATS</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to a non-empty string, Python will print statistics of the
pymalloc memory allocator every time a new pymalloc object arena is
created, and on shutdown.</p>
<p>This variable is ignored if the $<strong>PYTHONMALLOC</strong>
environment variable is used to force the <strong>malloc</strong>(3)
allocator of the C library, or if Python is configured without pymalloc
support.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, enable the
debug mode of the asyncio module.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONTRACEMALLOC</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, start
tracing Python memory allocations using the tracemalloc module.</p>
<p>The value of the variable is the maximum number of frames stored in a
traceback of a trace. For example, <em>PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=1</em> stores
only the most recent frame.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONFAULTHANDLER</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string,
<em>faulthandler.enable()</em> is called at startup: install a handler
for SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGABRT, SIGBUS and SIGILL signals to dump the
Python traceback.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to the <strong>-X faulthandler</strong>
option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONEXECUTABLE</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <em>sys.argv[0]</em> will be set
to its value instead of the value got through the C runtime. Only works
on Mac OS X.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONUSERBASE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the user base directory, which is used to compute the path of
the user <em>site-packages</em> directory and Distutils installation
paths for <em>python setup.py install --user</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONPROFILEIMPORTTIME</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, Python
will show how long each import takes. This is exactly equivalent to
setting <strong>-X importtime</strong> on the command line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONBREAKPOINT</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set to 0, it disables the default
debugger. It can be set to the callable of your debugger of choice.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Debug-mode variables</h2>
<p>Setting these variables only has an effect in a debug build of
Python, that is, if Python was configured with the
<strong>--with-pydebug</strong> build option.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PYTHONTHREADDEBUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, Python will print threading
debug info. The feature is deprecated in Python 3.10 and will be removed
in Python 3.12.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PYTHONDUMPREFS</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, Python will dump objects and
reference counts still alive after shutting down the interpreter.</p>
</dd>
