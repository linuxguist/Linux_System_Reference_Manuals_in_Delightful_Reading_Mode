<h1>NAME</h1>
<p><strong>gpg-check-pattern</strong> - Check a passphrase on stdin
against the patternfile</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>gpg-check-pattern</strong> [<em>options</em>]
<em>patternfile</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>gpg-check-pattern</strong> checks a passphrase given on stdin
against a specified pattern file.</p>
<p>The pattern file is line based with comment lines beginning on the
<em>first</em> position with a <strong>#</strong>. Empty lines and lines
with only white spaces are ignored. The actual pattern lines may either
be verbatim string pattern and match as they are (trailing spaces are
ignored) or extended regular expressions indicated by a
<strong>/</strong> or <strong>!/</strong> in the first column and
terminated by another <strong>/</strong> or end of line. If a regular
expression starts with <strong>!/</strong> the match result is reversed.
By default all comparisons are case insensitive.</p>
<p>Tag lines may be used to further control the operation of this tool.
The currently defined tags are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>[icase]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Switch to case insensitive comparison for all further patterns. This
is the default.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>[case]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Switch to case sensitive comparison for all further patterns.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>[reject]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Switch to reject mode. This is the default mode.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>[accept]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Switch to accept mode.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the future more tags may be introduced and thus it is advisable
not to start a plain pattern string with an open bracket. The tags must
be given verbatim on the line with no spaces to the left or any non
white space characters to the right.</p>
<p>In reject mode the program exits on the first match with an exit code
of 1 (failure). If at the end of the pattern list the reject mode is
still active the program exits with code 0 (success).</p>
<p>In accept mode blocks of patterns are used. A block starts at the
next pattern after an "accept" tag and ends with the last pattern before
the next "accept" or "reject" tag or at the end of the pattern list. If
all patterns in a block match the program exits with an exit code of 0
(success). If any pattern in a block do not match the next pattern block
is evaluated. If at the end of the pattern list the accept mode is still
active the program exits with code 1 (failure).</p>
