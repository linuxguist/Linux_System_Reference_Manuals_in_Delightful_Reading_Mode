<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>chage - change user password expiry information</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>chage</strong> [<em>options</em>] <em>LOGIN</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>chage</strong> command changes the number of days between
password changes and the date of the last password change. This
information is used by the system to determine when a user must change
their password.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The options which apply to the <strong>chage</strong> command
are:</p>
<p><strong>-d</strong>, <strong>--lastday</strong> <em>LAST_DAY</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the number of days since January 1st, 1970 when the password was
last changed. The date may also be expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD
(or the format more commonly used in your area). If the
<em>LAST_DAY</em> is set to <em>0</em> the user is forced to change his
password on the next log on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-E</strong>, <strong>--expiredate</strong>
<em>EXPIRE_DATE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the date or number of days since January 1, 1970 on which the
users account will no longer be accessible. The date may also be
expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the format more commonly used in
your area). A user whose account is locked must contact the system
administrator before being able to use the system again.</p>
<p>For example the following can be used to set an account to expire in
180 days:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>	    chage -E $(date -d +180days +%Y-%m-%d)
	  </code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Passing the number <em>-1</em> as the <em>EXPIRE_DATE</em> will
remove an account expiration date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help message and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-i</strong>, <strong>--iso8601</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When printing dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-I</strong>, <strong>--inactive</strong>
<em>INACTIVE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the number of days of inactivity after a password has expired
before the account is locked. The <em>INACTIVE</em> option is the number
of days of inactivity. A user whose account is locked must contact the
system administrator before being able to use the system again.</p>
<p>Passing the number <em>-1</em> as the <em>INACTIVE</em> will remove
an accounts inactivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-l</strong>, <strong>--list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show account aging information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-m</strong>, <strong>--mindays</strong> <em>MIN_DAYS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the minimum number of days between password changes to
<em>MIN_DAYS</em>. A value of zero for this field indicates that the
user may change their password at any time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-M</strong>, <strong>--maxdays</strong> <em>MAX_DAYS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the maximum number of days during which a password is valid. When
<em>MAX_DAYS</em> plus <em>LAST_DAY</em> is less than the current day,
the user will be required to change their password before being able to
use their account. This occurrence can be planned for in advance by use
of the <strong>-W</strong> option, which provides the user with advance
warning.</p>
<p>Passing the number <em>-1</em> as <em>MAX_DAYS</em> will remove
checking a passwords validity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-R</strong>, <strong>--root</strong> <em>CHROOT_DIR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apply changes in the <em>CHROOT_DIR</em> directory and use the
configuration files from the <em>CHROOT_DIR</em> directory. Only
absolute paths are supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-W</strong>, <strong>--warndays</strong>
<em>WARN_DAYS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the number of days of warning before a password change is
required. The <em>WARN_DAYS</em> option is the number of days prior to
the password expiring that a user will be warned their password is about
to expire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If none of the options are selected, <strong>chage</strong> operates
in an interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current values
for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change the field, or leave
the line blank to use the current value. The current value is displayed
between a pair of <em>[ ]</em> marks.</p>
<h1>NOTE</h1>
<p>The <strong>chage</strong> program requires a shadow password file to
be available.</p>
<p>The chage program will report only the information from the shadow
password file. This implies that configuration from other sources (e.g.
LDAP or empty password hash field from the passwd file) that affect the
users login will not be shown in the chage output.</p>
<p>The <strong>chage</strong> program will also not report any
inconsistency between the shadow and passwd files (e.g. missing x in the
passwd file). The <strong>pwck</strong> can be used to check for this
kind of inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The <strong>chage</strong> command is restricted to the root user,
except for the <strong>-l</strong> option, which may be used by an
unprivileged user to determine when their password or account is due to
expire.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the
behavior of this tool:</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>/etc/passwd</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User account information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/etc/shadow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secure user account information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXIT VALUES</h1>
<p>The <strong>chage</strong> command exits with the following
values:</p>
<p><em>0</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>success</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>permission denied</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>invalid command syntax</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>15</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>cant find the shadow password file</p>
</blockquote>
