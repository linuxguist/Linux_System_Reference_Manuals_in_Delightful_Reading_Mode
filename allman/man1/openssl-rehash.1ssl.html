<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command is generally equivalent to the external script
<strong>c_rehash</strong>, except for minor differences noted below.</p>
<p><strong>openssl rehash</strong> scans directories and calculates a
hash value of each <em>.pem</em>, <em>.crt</em>, <em>.cer</em>, or
<em>.crl</em> file in the specified directory list and creates symbolic
links for each file, where the name of the link is the hash value. (If
the platform does not support symbolic links, a copy is made.) This
command is useful as many programs that use OpenSSL require directories
to be set up like this in order to find certificates.</p>
<p>If any directories are named on the command line, then those are
processed in turn. If not, then the <strong>SSL_CERT_DIR</strong>
environment variable is consulted; this should be a colon-separated list
of directories, like the Unix <strong>PATH</strong> variable. If that is
not set then the default directory (installation-specific but often
<em>/usr/local/ssl/certs</em>) is processed.</p>
<p>In order for a directory to be processed, the user must have write
permissions on that directory, otherwise an error will be generated.</p>
<p>The links created are of the form <em>HHHHHHHH.D</em>, where each
<em>H</em> is a hexadecimal character and <em>D</em> is a single decimal
digit. When a directory is processed, all links in it that have a name
in that syntax are first removed, even if they are being used for some
other purpose. To skip the removal step, use the <strong>-n</strong>
flag. Hashes for CRL's look similar except the letter <strong>r</strong>
appears after the period, like this:
<em>HHHHHHHH.</em><strong>r</strong><em>D</em>.</p>
<p>Multiple objects may have the same hash; they will be indicated by
incrementing the <em>D</em> value. Duplicates are found by comparing the
full SHA-1 fingerprint. A warning will be displayed if a duplicate is
found.</p>
<p>A warning will also be displayed if there are files that cannot be
parsed as either a certificate or a CRL or if more than one such object
appears in the file.</p>
<h2>Script Configuration</h2>
<p>The <strong>c_rehash</strong> script uses the
<strong>openssl</strong> program to compute the hashes and fingerprints.
If not found in the user's <strong>PATH</strong>, then set the
<strong>OPENSSL</strong> environment variable to the full pathname. Any
program can be used, it will be invoked as follows for either a
certificate or CRL:</p>
<p>$OPENSSL x509 -hash -fingerprint -noout -in FILENAME $OPENSSL crl
-hash -fingerprint -noout -in FILENAME</p>
<p>where <em>FILENAME</em> is the filename. It must output the hash of
the file on the first line, and the fingerprint on the second,
optionally prefixed with some text and an equals sign.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-help -h</dt>
<dd>
<p>Display a brief usage message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-old</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use old-style hashing (MD5, as opposed to SHA-1) for generating links
to be used for releases before 1.0.0. Note that current versions will
not use the old style.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-n</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not remove existing links. This is needed when keeping new and
old-style links in the same directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-compat</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate links for both old-style (MD5) and new-style (SHA1) hashing.
This allows releases before 1.0.0 to use these links along-side newer
releases.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-v</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print messages about old links removed and new links created. By
default, this command only lists each directory as it is processed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-provider name</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-provider-path path</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-propquery propq</dt>
<dd>

<p>See Provider Options in <strong>openssl</strong> (1),
<strong>provider</strong> (7), and <strong>property</strong> (7).</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt>OPENSSL</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to an executable to use to generate hashes and fingerprints
(see above).</p>
</dd>
<dt>SSL_CERT_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Colon separated list of directories to operate on. Ignored if
directories are listed on the command line.</p>
</dd>
