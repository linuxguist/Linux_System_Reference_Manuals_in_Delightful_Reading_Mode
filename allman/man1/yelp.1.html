<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>yelp â€” browse system documentation</p>
<h1>USAGE</h1>
<p>yelp [file]</p>
<p>The GNOME Help Browser includes detailed documentation for the
majority of applications, utilities and other components, such as the
panel or the Nautilus file manager.</p>
<p>Yelp can display some HTML and XML files when passed on the
command-line, but it's primarily called from applications.</p>
<p>You can also start Yelp by choosing Desktop-&gt;Help. This will show
the top-level help system page, listing all GNOME documents conveniently
organized by topic.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>This program accepts all the standard GNOME and GTK+ options, which
follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting
with two dashes (`-'). To get more information about these options
launch Yelp with the `--help' argument.</p>
