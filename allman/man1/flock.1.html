<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>flock - manage locks from shell scripts</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>flock</strong> [options] <em>file</em>|<em>directory</em>
<em>command</em> [<em>arguments</em>]</p>
<p><strong>flock</strong> [options] <em>file</em>|<em>directory</em>
<strong>-c</strong> <em>command</em></p>
<p><strong>flock</strong> [options] <em>number</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This utility manages <strong>flock</strong>(2) locks from within
shell scripts or from the command line.</p>
<p>The first and second of the above forms wrap the lock around the
execution of a <em>command</em>, in a manner similar to
<strong>su</strong>(1) or <strong>newgrp</strong>(1). They lock a
specified <em>file</em> or <em>directory</em>, which is created
(assuming appropriate permissions) if it does not already exist. By
default, if the lock cannot be immediately acquired,
<strong>flock</strong> waits until the lock is available.</p>
<p>The third form uses an open file by its file descriptor
<em>number</em>. See the examples below for how that can be used.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--command</strong> <em>command</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass a single <em>command</em>, without arguments, to the shell with
<strong>-c</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-E</strong>, <strong>--conflict-exit-code</strong>
<em>number</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exit status used when the <strong>-n</strong> option is in use,
and the conflicting lock exists, or the <strong>-w</strong> option is in
use, and the timeout is reached. The default value is
<strong>1</strong>. The <em>number</em> has to be in the range of 0 to
255.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-F</strong>, <strong>--no-fork</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not fork before executing <em>command</em>. Upon execution the
flock process is replaced by <em>command</em> which continues to hold
the lock. This option is incompatible with <strong>--close</strong> as
there would otherwise be nothing left to hold the lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-e</strong>, <strong>-x</strong>,
<strong>--exclusive</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obtain an exclusive lock, sometimes called a write lock. This is the
default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--nb</strong>,
<strong>--nonblock</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fail rather than wait if the lock cannot be immediately acquired. See
the <strong>-E</strong> option for the exit status used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-o</strong>, <strong>--close</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Close the file descriptor on which the lock is held before executing
<em>command</em>. This is useful if <em>command</em> spawns a child
process which should not be holding the lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-s</strong>, <strong>--shared</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obtain a shared lock, sometimes called a read lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-u</strong>, <strong>--unlock</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drop a lock. This is usually not required, since a lock is
automatically dropped when the file is closed. However, it may be
required in special cases, for example if the enclosed command group may
have forked a background process which should not be holding the
lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-w</strong>, <strong>--wait</strong>,
<strong>--timeout</strong> <em>seconds</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fail if the lock cannot be acquired within <em>seconds</em>. Decimal
fractional values are allowed. See the <strong>-E</strong> option for
the exit status used. The zero number of <em>seconds</em> is interpreted
as <strong>--nonblock</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Report how long it took to acquire the lock, or why the lock could
not be obtained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print version and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>The command uses &lt;sysexits.h&gt; exit status values for
everything, except when using either of the options <strong>-n</strong>
or <strong>-w</strong> which report a failure to acquire the lock with
an exit status given by the <strong>-E</strong> option, or 1 by default.
The exit status given by <strong>-E</strong> has to be in the range of 0
to 255.</p>
<p>When using the <em>command</em> variant, and executing the child
worked, then the exit status is that of the child command.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p><strong>flock</strong> does not detect deadlock. See
<strong>flock</strong>(2) for details.</p>
<p>Some file systems (e. g. NFS and CIFS) have a limited implementation
of <strong>flock</strong>(2) and flock may always fail. For details see
<strong>flock</strong>(2), <strong>nfs</strong>(5) and
<strong>mount.cifs</strong>(8). Depending on mount options, flock can
always fail there.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Note that "shell&gt; " in examples is a command line prompt.</p>
<p>shell1&gt; flock /tmp -c cat; shell2&gt; flock -w .007 /tmp -c echo;
/bin/echo $?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set exclusive lock to directory <em>/tmp</em> and the second command
will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>shell1&gt; flock -s /tmp -c cat; shell2&gt; flock -s -w .007 /tmp -c
echo; /bin/echo $?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set shared lock to directory <em>/tmp</em> and the second command
will not fail. Notice that attempting to get exclusive lock with second
command would fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>shell&gt; flock -x local-lock-file echo 'a b c'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grab the exclusive lock "local-lock-file" before running echo with 'a
b c'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(; flock -n 9 || exit 1; # ... commands executed under lock ...; )
9&gt;/var/lock/mylockfile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The form is convenient inside shell scripts. The mode used to open
the file doesn’t matter to <strong>flock</strong>; using <em>&gt;</em>
or <em>&gt;&gt;</em> allows the lockfile to be created if it does not
already exist, however, write permission is required. Using
<em>&lt;</em> requires that the file already exists but only read
permission is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ "${FLOCKER}" != "$0" ] &amp;&amp; exec env FLOCKER="$0" flock -en
"$0" "$0" "$@" || :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is useful boilerplate code for shell scripts. Put it at the top
of the shell script you want to lock and it’ll automatically lock itself
on the first run. If the environment variable <strong>$FLOCKER</strong>
is not set to the shell script that is being run, then execute
<strong>flock</strong> and grab an exclusive non-blocking lock (using
the script itself as the lock file) before re-execing itself with the
right arguments. It also sets the <strong>FLOCKER</strong> environment
variable to the right value so it doesn’t run again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>shell&gt; exec 4&lt;&gt;/var/lock/mylockfile; shell&gt; flock -n
4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is convenient for locking a file without spawning a
subprocess. The shell opens the lock file for reading and writing as
file descriptor 4, then <strong>flock</strong> is used to lock the
descriptor.</p>
