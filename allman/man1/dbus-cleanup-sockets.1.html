<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dbus-cleanup-sockets - clean up leftover sockets in a directory</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>dbus-cleanup-sockets</strong> [<em>DIRECTORY</em>]<br />
</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>dbus-cleanup-sockets</strong> command cleans up unused
D-Bus connection sockets. See
<strong>http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/</strong> for more
information about the big picture.</p>
<p>If given no arguments, <strong>dbus-cleanup-sockets</strong> cleans
up sockets in the standard default socket directory for the
per-user-login-session message bus; this is usually /tmp. Optionally,
you can pass a different directory on the command line.</p>
<p>On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because D-Bus defaults
to using "abstract sockets" that exist only in memory and dont have a
corresponding file in /tmp.</p>
<p>On most other flavors of UNIX, its possible for the socket files to
leak when programs using D-Bus exit abnormally or without closing their
D-Bus connections. Thus, it might be interesting to run
dbus-cleanup-sockets in a cron job to mop up any leaked sockets. Or you
can just ignore the leaked sockets, they arent really hurting anything,
other than cluttering the output of "ls /tmp"</p>
