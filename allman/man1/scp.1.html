<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local

remote hosts. Note that, when using the legacy SCP protocol (via the</p>

<p>Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.</p>
<p>Use the legacy SCP protocol for file transfers instead of the SFTP
protocol. Forcing the use of the SCP protocol may be necessary for
servers that do not implement SFTP, for backwards-compatibility for
particular filename wildcard patterns and for expanding paths with a</p>

<p>checks that the received filenames match those requested on the
command-line to prevent the remote end from sending unexpected or
unwanted files. Because of differences in how various operating systems

of fully trusting that the server will not send unexpected

<p>Specify an option that controls aspects of SFTP protocol behaviour.
The valid options are:</p>
<p>Controls how many concurrent SFTP read or write requests may be in
progress at any point in time during a download or upload. By default 64
requests may be active concurrently.</p>
<p>Controls the maximum buffer size for a single SFTP read/write
operation used during download or upload. By default a 32KB buffer is
used.</p>

<p>source code from the Regents of the University of California.</p>
<p>Since OpenSSH 9.0,</p>

<p>The legacy SCP protocol (selected by the</p>
<p>flag) requires execution of the remote user's shell to perform</p>
<p>pattern matching. This requires careful quoting of any characters
that have special meaning to the remote shell, such as quote
characters.</p>
