<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>resize - set environment and terminal settings to current xterm
window size</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>resize</strong> [ <strong>-v</strong> | <strong>-u</strong> |
<strong>-c</strong> ] [ <strong>-s</strong> [ <em>row col</em> ] ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Resize</em> prints a shell command for setting the appropriate
environment variables to indicate the current size of <em>xterm</em>
window from which the command is run.</p>
<p><em>Resize</em> determines the command through several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>first, it finds the name of the user's shell program. It uses the
<strong>SHELL</strong> variable if set, otherwise it uses the user's
data from /etc/passwd.</p></li>
<li><p>then it decides whether to use Bourne shell syntax or C-Shell
syntax. It uses a built-in table of known shells, which can be
overridden by the <strong>-u</strong> and <strong>-c</strong>
options.</p></li>
<li><p>then <em>resize</em> asks the operating system for the terminal
settings. This is the same information which can be manipulated using
<em>stty</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>then <em>resize</em> asks the terminal for its size in
characters. Depending on whether the "<strong>-s</strong> option is
given, <em>resize</em> uses a different escape sequence to ask for this
information.</p></li>
<li><p>at this point, <em>resize</em> attempts to update the terminal
settings to reflect the terminal window's size in pixels:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if the <strong>-s</strong> option is used, <em>resize</em> then
asks the terminal for its size in pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>otherwise, <em>resize</em> asks the operating system for the
information and updates that after ensuring that the window's dimensions
are a multiple of the character height and width.</p></li>
<li><p>in either case, the updated terminal settings are done using a
different system call than used for <em>stty</em>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>then <em>resize</em> updates the terminal settings to reflect any
altered values such as its size in rows or columns. This affects the
values shown by <em>stty</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>finally, <em>resize</em> generates shell commands for setting the
environment variables, and writes that to the standard output.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>For <em>resize</em>'s output to take effect, <em>resize</em> must
either be evaluated as part of the command line (usually done with a
shell alias or function) or else redirected to a file which can then be
read in. From the C shell (usually known as <em>/bin/csh</em>), the
following alias could be defined in the user's <em>.cshrc</em>:</p>
<pre><code>        %  alias rs set noglob; eval `resize`</code></pre>
<p>After resizing the window, the user would type:</p>
<pre><code>        %  rs</code></pre>
<p>Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as
<em>/bin/sh</em>) that don't have command functions will need to send
the output to a temporary file and then read it back in with the .
command:</p>
<pre><code>        $  resize &gt; /tmp/out
        $  .â€‡/tmp/out</code></pre>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options may be used with <em>resize</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-c</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that C shell commands should be generated even
if the user's current shell does not appear to use C shell syntax.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-s [<em>rows</em> columns]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be used
instead of the VT100-style <em>xterm</em> escape codes. If <em>rows</em>
and <em>columns</em> are given, <em>resize</em> will ask the
<em>xterm</em> to resize itself using those values.</p>
<p>Both of the escape sequences used for this option (first to obtain
the window size and second to modify it) are subject to <em>xterm</em>'s
<strong>allowWindowOps</strong> resource setting. The window manager may
also choose to disallow the change.</p>
<p>The VT100-style escape sequence used to determine the screen size
always works for VT100-compatible terminals. VT100s have no
corresponding way to modify the screensize.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-u</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be generated
even if the user's current shell does not appear to use Bourne shell
syntax.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This causes <em>resize</em> to print a version number to the standard
output, and then exit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the Sun console escape sequences are recognized by XFree86
<em>xterm</em> and by <em>dtterm</em>. The <em>resize</em> program may
be installed as <em>sunsize</em>, which causes makes it assume the
<strong>-s</strong> option.</p>
<p>The <em>rows</em> and <em>columns</em> arguments must appear last;
though they are normally associated with the <strong>-s</strong> option,
they are parsed separately.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt>/etc/termcap</dt>
<dd>
<p>for the base termcap entry to modify.</p>
</dd>
<dt>~/.cshrc</dt>
<dd>
<p>user's alias for the command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt>SHELL</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unless overridden by the <strong>-c</strong> option, <em>resize</em>
determines the user's current shell by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>first checking if <strong>$SHELL</strong> is set, and using
that,</p></li>
<li><p>otherwise <em>resize</em> looks in the password file
(/etc/passwd).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally Bourne-shell variants (including <em>ksh</em>) do not
modify <strong>$SHELL</strong>, so it is possible for <em>resize</em> to
be confused if one runs <em>resize</em> from a Bourne shell spawned from
a C shell.</p>
<p>After determining the user's shell, <em>resize</em> checks the
shell's name against a table of known shell names. If it does not find
the name in its table, <em>resize</em> will use C shell syntax for the
generated commands to set environment variables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TERM</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Resize</em>'s generated shell command sets this to "xterm" if not
already set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TERMCAP</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Resize</em>'s generated shell command sets this variable on
systems using termcap, e.g., when <em>resize</em> is linked with the
<em>termcap</em> library rather than a <em>terminfo</em> library. The
latter does not provide the complete text for a termcap entry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>COLUMNS, LINES</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Resize</em>'s generated shell command sets these variables on
systems using terminfo. Many applications (including the curses library)
use those variables when set to override their screensize.</p>
</dd>
