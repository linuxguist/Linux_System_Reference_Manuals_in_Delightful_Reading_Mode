<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>zmore - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>zmore</strong> [ name ... ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>zmore</em> command is a filter which allows examination of
compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy
terminal. The <strong>zmore</strong> command works on files compressed
with <strong>compress</strong>, <strong>pack</strong> or
<strong>gzip</strong>, and also on uncompressed files. If a file does
not exist, <strong>zmore</strong> looks for a file of the same name with
the addition of a .gz, .z or .Z suffix.</p>
<p>The <strong>zmore</strong> command normally pauses after each
screenful, printing --More-- at the bottom of the screen. If the user
then types a carriage return, one more line is displayed. If the user
hits a space, another screenful is displayed. Other possibilities are
enumerated later.</p>
<p>The <strong>zmore</strong> command looks in the file
<em>/etc/termcap</em> to determine terminal characteristics, and to
determine the default window size. On a terminal capable of displaying
24 lines, the default window size is 22 lines. To use a pager other than
the default <strong>more</strong>, set environment variable PAGER to the
name of the desired program, such as <strong>less</strong>.</p>
<p>Other sequences which may be typed when <strong>zmore</strong>
pauses, and their effects, are as follows (<em>i</em> is an optional
integer argument, defaulting to 1) :</p>
<dl>
<dt>i &lt;space&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>display <em>i</em> more lines, (or another screenful if no argument
is given)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>^D</dt>
<dd>
<p>display 11 more lines (a ``scroll''). If <em>i</em> is given, then
the scroll size is set to <em>i</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li><p>same as ^D (control-D)</p></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>i z</dt>
<dd>
<p>same as typing a space except that <em>i</em>, if present, becomes
the new window size.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>i s</dt>
<dd>
<p>skip <em>i</em> lines and print a screenful of lines</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>i f</dt>
<dd>
<p>skip <em>i</em> screenfuls and print a screenful of lines</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>q or Q</dt>
<dd>
<p>Quit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>=</dt>
<dd>
<p>Display the current line number.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>i/expr</dt>
<dd>
<p>search for the <em>i </em>-th occurrence of the regular expression
<em>expr.</em> The user's erase and kill characters may be used to edit
the regular expression. Erasing back past the first column cancels the
search command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>i n</dt>
<dd>
<p>search for the <em>i </em>-th occurrence of the last regular
expression entered.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>!command</dt>
<dd>
<p>invoke a shell with <em>command</em>. The character `!' in "command"
is replaced with the previous shell command. The sequence "\!" is
replaced by "!".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>:q or :Q</dt>
<dd>
<p>Quit (same as q or Q).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>.</dt>
<dd>
<p>(dot) repeat the previous command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not necessary to
type a carriage return. Up to the time when the command character itself
is given, the user may hit the line kill character to cancel the
numerical argument being formed. In addition, the user may hit the erase
character to redisplay the --More-- message.</p>
<p>At any time when output is being sent to the terminal, the user can
hit the quit key (normally control-\). The <em>zmore</em> command will
stop sending output, and will display the usual --More-- prompt. The
user may then enter one of the above commands in the normal manner.
Unfortunately, some output is lost when this is done, due to the fact
that any characters waiting in the terminal's output queue are flushed
when the quit signal occurs.</p>
<p>The terminal is set to <em>noecho</em> mode by this program so that
the output can be continuous. What you type will thus not show on your
terminal, except for the / and ! commands.</p>
<p>If the standard output is not a teletype, then <strong>zmore</strong>
acts just like <strong>zcat</strong>, except that a header is printed
before each file if there is more than one file.</p>
