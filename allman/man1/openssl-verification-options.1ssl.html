<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>openssl-verification-options - generic X.509 certificate verification
options</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>openssl</strong> <em>command</em> [ <em>options</em> ... ] [
<em>parameters</em> ... ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>There are many situations where X.509 certificates are verified
within the OpenSSL libraries and in various OpenSSL commands.</p>
<p>Certificate verification is implemented by
<strong>X509_verify_cert</strong> (3). It is a complicated process
consisting of a number of steps and depending on numerous options. The
most important of them are detailed in the following sections.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, a valid chain of certificates needs to be built up and
verified starting from the <em>target certificate</em> that is to be
verified and ending in a certificate that due to some policy is trusted.
Verification is done relative to the given <em>purpose</em>, which is
the intended use of the target certificate, such as SSL server, or by
default for any purpose.</p>
<p>The details of how each OpenSSL command handles errors are documented
on the specific command page.</p>
<p>DANE support is documented in <strong>openssl-s_client</strong> (1),
<strong>SSL_CTX_dane_enable</strong> (3),
<strong>SSL_set1_host</strong> (3),
<strong>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags</strong> (3), and
<strong>X509_check_host</strong> (3).</p>
<h2>Trust Anchors</h2>
<p>In general, according to RFC 4158 and RFC 5280, a <em>trust
anchor</em> is any public key and related subject distinguished name
(DN) that for some reason is considered trusted and thus is acceptable
as the root of a chain of certificates.</p>
<p>In practice, trust anchors are given in the form of certificates,
where their essential fields are the public key and the subject DN. In
addition to the requirements in RFC 5280, OpenSSL checks the validity
period of such certificates and makes use of some further fields. In
particular, the subject key identifier extension, if present, is used
for matching trust anchors during chain building.</p>
<p>In the most simple and common case, trust anchors are by default all
self-signed root CA certificates that are placed in the <em>trust
store</em>, which is a collection of certificates that are trusted for
certain uses. This is akin to what is used in the trust stores of
Mozilla Firefox, or Apple's and Microsoft's certificate stores, ...</p>
<p>From the OpenSSL perspective, a trust anchor is a certificate that
should be augmented with an explicit designation for which uses of a
target certificate the certificate may serve as a trust anchor. In PEM
encoding, this is indicated by the <code>TRUSTED CERTIFICATE</code>
string. Such a designation provides a set of positive trust attributes
explicitly stating trust for the listed purposes and/or a set of
negative trust attributes explicitly rejecting the use for the listed
purposes. The purposes are encoded using the values defined for the
extended key usages (EKUs) that may be given in X.509 extensions of
end-entity certificates. See also the Extended Key Usage section
below.</p>
<p>The currently recognized uses are <strong>clientAuth</strong> (SSL
client use), <strong>serverAuth</strong> (SSL server use),
<strong>emailProtection</strong> (S/MIME email use),
<strong>codeSigning</strong> (object signer use),
<strong>OCSPSigning</strong> (OCSP responder use), <strong>OCSP</strong>
(OCSP request use), <strong>timeStamping</strong> (TSA server use), and
<strong>anyExtendedKeyUsage</strong>. As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, the last of
these blocks all uses when rejected or enables all uses when
trusted.</p>
<p>A certificate, which may be CA certificate or an end-entity
certificate, is considered a trust anchor for the given use if and only
if all the following conditions hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is an an element of the trust store.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not have a negative trust attribute rejecting the given
use.</p></li>
<li><p>It has a positive trust attribute accepting the given use or (by
default) one of the following compatibility conditions apply: It is
self-signed or the <strong>-partial_chain</strong> option is given
(which corresponds to the <strong>X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN</strong>
flag being set).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Certification Path Building</h2>
<p>First, a certificate chain is built up starting from the target
certificate and ending in a trust anchor.</p>
<p>The chain is built up iteratively, looking up in turn a certificate
with suitable key usage that matches as an issuer of the current subject
certificate as described below. If there is such a certificate, the
first one found that is currently valid is taken, otherwise the one that
expired most recently of all such certificates. For efficiency, no
backtracking is performed, thus any further candidate issuer
certificates that would match equally are ignored.</p>
<p>When a self-signed certificate has been added, chain construction
stops. In this case it must fully match a trust anchor, otherwise chain
building fails.</p>
<p>A candidate issuer certificate matches a subject certificate if all
of the following conditions hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Its subject name matches the issuer name of the subject
certificate.</p></li>
<li><p>If the subject certificate has an authority key identifier
extension, each of its sub-fields equals the corresponding subject key
identifier, serial number, and issuer field of the candidate issuer
certificate, as far as the respective fields are present in both
certificates.</p></li>
<li><p>The certificate signature algorithm used to sign the subject
certificate is supported and equals the public key algorithm of the
candidate issuer certificate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The lookup first searches for issuer certificates in the trust store.
If it does not find a match there it consults the list of untrusted
(intermediate CA) certificates, if provided.</p>
<h2>Certification Path Validation</h2>
<p>When the certificate chain building process was successful the chain
components and their links are checked thoroughly.</p>
<p>The first step is to check that each certificate is well-formed. Part
of these checks are enabled only if the <strong>-x509_strict</strong>
option is given.</p>
<p>The second step is to check the extensions of every untrusted
certificate for consistency with the supplied purpose. If the
<strong>-purpose</strong> option is not given then no such checks are
done except for SSL/TLS connection setup, where by default
<code>sslserver</code> or <code>sslclient</code>, are checked. The
target or leaf certificate, as well as any other untrusted certificates,
must have extensions compatible with the specified purpose. All
certificates except the target or leaf must also be valid CA
certificates. The precise extensions required are described in more
detail in CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS in
<strong>openssl-x509</strong> (1).</p>
<p>The third step is to check the trust settings on the last certificate
(which typically is a self-signed root CA certificate). It must be
trusted for the given use. For compatibility with previous versions of
OpenSSL, a self-signed certificate with no trust attributes is
considered to be valid for all uses.</p>
<p>The fourth, and final, step is to check the validity of the
certificate chain. For each element in the chain, including the root CA
certificate, the validity period as specified by the
<code>notBefore</code> and <code>notAfter</code> fields is checked
against the current system time. The <strong>-attime</strong> flag may
be used to use a reference time other than now. The certificate
signature is checked as well (except for the signature of the typically
self-signed root CA certificate, which is verified only if the
<strong>-check_ss_sig</strong> option is given). When verifying a
certificate signature the keyUsage extension (if present) of the
candidate issuer certificate is checked to permit digitalSignature for
signing proxy certificates or to permit keyCertSign for signing other
certificates, respectively. If all operations complete successfully then
certificate is considered valid. If any operation fails then the
certificate is not valid.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<h2>Trusted Certificate Options</h2>
<p>The following options specify how to supply the certificates that can
be used as trust anchors for certain uses. As mentioned, a collection of
such certificates is called a <em>trust store</em>.</p>
<p>Note that OpenSSL does not provide a default set of trust anchors.
Many Linux distributions include a system default and configure OpenSSL
to point to that. Mozilla maintains an influential trust store that can
be found at
&lt;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/&gt;.</p>
<p>The certificates to add to the trust store can be specified using
following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-CAfile file</dt>
<dd>
<p>Load the specified file which contains a certificate or several of
them in case the input is in PEM or PKCS#12 format. PEM-encoded
certificates may also have trust attributes set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-no-CAfile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not load the default file of trusted certificates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-CApath dir</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use the specified directory as a collection of trusted certificates,
i.e., a trust store. Files should be named with the hash value of the
X.509 SubjectName of each certificate. This is so that the library can
extract the IssuerName, hash it, and directly lookup the file to get the
issuer certificate. See <strong>openssl-rehash</strong> (1) for
information on creating this type of directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-no-CApath</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not use the default directory of trusted certificates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-CAstore uri</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use <em>uri</em> as a store of CA certificates. The URI may indicate
a single certificate, as well as a collection of them. With URIs in the
<code>file:</code> scheme, this acts as <strong>-CAfile</strong> or
<strong>-CApath</strong>, depending on if the URI indicates a single
file or directory. See <strong>ossl_store-file</strong> (7) for more
information on the <code>file:</code> scheme. These certificates are
also used when building the server certificate chain (for example with
<strong>openssl-s_server</strong> (1)) or client certificate chain (for
example with <strong>openssl-s_time</strong> (1)).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-no-CAstore</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not use the default store of trusted CA certificates.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Verification Options</h2>
<p>The certificate verification can be fine-tuned with the following
flags.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-verbose</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print extra information about the operations being performed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-attime timestamp</dt>
<dd>
<p>Perform validation checks using time specified by <em>timestamp</em>
and not current system time. <em>timestamp</em> is the number of seconds
since January 1, 1970 (i.e., the Unix Epoch).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-no_check_time</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option suppresses checking the validity period of certificates
and CRLs against the current time. If option <strong>-attime</strong> is
used to specify a verification time, the check is not suppressed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-x509_strict</dt>
<dd>
<p>This disables non-compliant workarounds for broken certificates. Thus
errors are thrown on certificates not compliant with RFC 5280. When this
option is set, among others, the following certificate well-formedness
conditions are checked:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The basicConstraints of CA certificates must be marked
critical.</p></li>
<li><p>CA certificates must explicitly include the keyUsage
extension.</p></li>
<li><p>If a pathlenConstraint is given the key usage keyCertSign must be
allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>The pathlenConstraint must not be given for non-CA
certificates.</p></li>
<li><p>The issuer name of any certificate must not be empty.</p></li>
<li><p>The subject name of CA certs, certs with keyUsage crlSign, and
certs without subjectAlternativeName must not be empty.</p></li>
<li><p>If a subjectAlternativeName extension is given it must not be
empty.</p></li>
<li><p>The signatureAlgorithm field and the cert signature must be
consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Any given authorityKeyIdentifier and any given
subjectKeyIdentifier must not be marked critical.</p></li>
<li><p>The authorityKeyIdentifier must be given for X.509v3 certs unless
they are self-signed.</p></li>
<li><p>The subjectKeyIdentifier must be given for all X.509v3 CA
certs.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>-ignore_critical</dt>
<dd>
<p>Normally if an unhandled critical extension is present that is not
supported by OpenSSL the certificate is rejected (as required by
RFC5280). If this option is set critical extensions are ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-issuer_checks</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-crl_check</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks end entity certificate validity by attempting to look up a
valid CRL. If a valid CRL cannot be found an error occurs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-crl_check_all</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks the validity of <strong>all</strong> certificates in the chain
by attempting to look up valid CRLs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-use_deltas</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable support for delta CRLs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-extended_crl</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable extended CRL features such as indirect CRLs and alternate CRL
signing keys.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-suiteB_128_only, -suiteB_128, -suiteB_192</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable the Suite B mode operation at 128 bit Level of Security, 128
bit or 192 bit, or only 192 bit Level of Security respectively. See
RFC6460 for details. In particular the supported signature algorithms
are reduced to support only ECDSA and SHA256 or SHA384 and only the
elliptic curves P-256 and P-384.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-auth_level level</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the certificate chain authentication security level to
<em>level</em>. The authentication security level determines the
acceptable signature and public key strength when verifying certificate
chains. For a certificate chain to validate, the public keys of all the
certificates must meet the specified security <em>level</em>. The
signature algorithm security level is enforced for all the certificates
in the chain except for the chain's <em>trust anchor</em>, which is
either directly trusted or validated by means other than its signature.
See <strong>SSL_CTX_set_security_level</strong> (3) for the definitions
of the available levels. The default security level is -1, or not set.
At security level 0 or lower all algorithms are acceptable. Security
level 1 requires at least 80-bit-equivalent security and is broadly
interoperable, though it will, for example, reject MD5 signatures or RSA
keys shorter than 1024 bits.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-partial_chain</dt>
<dd>
<p>Allow verification to succeed if an incomplete chain can be built.
That is, a chain ending in a certificate that normally would not be
trusted (because it has no matching positive trust attributes and is not
self-signed) but is an element of the trust store. This certificate may
be self-issued or belong to an intermediate CA.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-check_ss_sig</dt>
<dd>
<p>Verify the signature of the last certificate in a chain if the
certificate is supposedly self-signed. This is prohibited and will
result in an error if it is a non-conforming CA certificate with key
usage restrictions not including the keyCertSign bit. This verification
is disabled by default because it doesn't add any security.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-allow_proxy_certs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Allow the verification of proxy certificates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-trusted_first</dt>
<dd>
<p>As of OpenSSL 1.1.0 this option is on by default and cannot be
disabled. When constructing the certificate chain, the trusted
certificates specified via <strong>-CAfile</strong>,
<strong>-CApath</strong>, <strong>-CAstore</strong> or
<strong>-trusted</strong> are always used before any certificates
specified via <strong>-untrusted</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-no_alt_chains</dt>
<dd>
<p>As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, since <strong>-trusted_first</strong> always on,
this option has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-trusted file</dt>
<dd>
<p>Parse <em>file</em> as a set of one or more certificates. Each of
them qualifies as trusted if has a suitable positive trust attribute or
it is self-signed or the <strong>-partial_chain</strong> option is
specified. This option implies the <strong>-no-CAfile</strong>,
<strong>-no-CApath</strong>, and <strong>-no-CAstore</strong> options
and it cannot be used with the <strong>-CAfile</strong>,
<strong>-CApath</strong> or <strong>-CAstore</strong> options, so only
certificates specified using the <strong>-trusted</strong> option are
trust anchors. This option may be used multiple times.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-untrusted file</dt>
<dd>
<p>Parse <em>file</em> as a set of one or more certificates. All
certificates (typically of intermediate CAs) are considered untrusted
and may be used to construct a certificate chain from the target
certificate to a trust anchor. This option may be used multiple
times.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-policy arg</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable policy processing and add <em>arg</em> to the
user-initial-policy-set (see RFC5280). The policy <em>arg</em> can be an
object name an OID in numeric form. This argument can appear more than
once.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-explicit_policy</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set policy variable require-explicit-policy (see RFC5280).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-policy_check</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables certificate policy processing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-policy_print</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print out diagnostics related to policy processing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-inhibit_any</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set policy variable inhibit-any-policy (see RFC5280).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-inhibit_map</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set policy variable inhibit-policy-mapping (see RFC5280).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-purpose purpose</dt>
<dd>
<p>The intended use for the certificate. Currently defined purposes are
<code>sslclient</code>, <code>sslserver</code>,
<code>nssslserver</code>, <code>smimesign</code>,
<code>smimeencrypt</code>, <code>crlsign</code>,
<code>ocsphelper</code>, <code>timestampsign</code>, and
<code>any</code>. If peer certificate verification is enabled, by
default the TLS implementation as well as the commands
<strong>s_client</strong> and <strong>s_server</strong> check for
consistency with TLS server or TLS client use, respectively. While IETF
RFC 5280 says that <strong>id-kp-serverAuth</strong> and
<strong>id-kp-clientAuth</strong> are only for WWW use, in practice they
are used for all kinds of TLS clients and servers, and this is what
OpenSSL assumes as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-verify_depth num</dt>
<dd>
<p>Limit the certificate chain to <em>num</em> intermediate CA
certificates. A maximal depth chain can have up to <em>num</em>+2
certificates, since neither the end-entity certificate nor the
trust-anchor certificate count against the
<strong>-verify_depth</strong> limit.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-verify_email email</dt>
<dd>
<p>Verify if <em>email</em> matches the email address in Subject
Alternative Name or the email in the subject Distinguished Name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-verify_hostname hostname</dt>
<dd>
<p>Verify if <em>hostname</em> matches DNS name in Subject Alternative
Name or Common Name in the subject certificate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-verify_ip ip</dt>
<dd>
<p>Verify if <em>ip</em> matches the IP address in Subject Alternative
Name of the subject certificate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-verify_name name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use default verification policies like trust model and required
certificate policies identified by <em>name</em>. The trust model
determines which auxiliary trust or reject OIDs are applicable to
verifying the given certificate chain. They can be given using the
<strong>-addtrust</strong> and <strong>-addreject</strong> options for
<strong>openssl-x509</strong> (1). Supported policy names include:
<strong>default</strong>, <strong>pkcs7</strong>,
<strong>smime_sign</strong>, <strong>ssl_client</strong>,
<strong>ssl_server</strong>. These mimics the combinations of purpose
and trust settings used in SSL, CMS and S/MIME. As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, the
trust model is inferred from the purpose when not specified, so the
<strong>-verify_name</strong> options are functionally equivalent to the
corresponding <strong>-purpose</strong> settings.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Extended Verification Options</h2>
<p>Sometimes there may be more than one certificate chain leading to an
end-entity certificate. This usually happens when a root or intermediate
CA signs a certificate for another a CA in other organization. Another
reason is when a CA might have intermediates that use two different
signature formats, such as a SHA-1 and a SHA-256 digest.</p>
<p>The following options can be used to provide data that will allow the
OpenSSL command to generate an alternative chain.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-xkey infile, -xcert infile, -xchain</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify an extra certificate, private key and certificate chain.
These behave in the same manner as the <strong>-cert</strong>,
<strong>-key</strong> and <strong>-cert_chain</strong> options. When
specified, the callback returning the first valid chain will be in use
by the client.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-xchain_build</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify whether the application should build the certificate chain to
be provided to the server for the extra certificates via the
<strong>-xkey</strong>, <strong>-xcert</strong>, and
<strong>-xchain</strong> options.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-xcertform DER|PEM|P12</dt>
<dd>
<p>The input format for the extra certificate. This option has no effect
and is retained for backward compatibility only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-xkeyform DER|PEM|P12</dt>
<dd>
<p>The input format for the extra key. This option has no effect and is
retained for backward compatibility only.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Certificate Extensions</h2>
<p>Options like <strong>-purpose</strong> lead to checking the
certificate extensions, which determine what the target certificate and
intermediate CA certificates can be used for.</p>
<p><em>Basic Constraints</em></p>
<p>The basicConstraints extension CA flag is used to determine whether
the certificate can be used as a CA. If the CA flag is true then it is a
CA, if the CA flag is false then it is not a CA. <strong>All</strong>
CAs should have the CA flag set to true.</p>
<p>If the basicConstraints extension is absent, which includes the case
that it is an X.509v1 certificate, then the certificate is considered to
be a possible CA and other extensions are checked according to the
intended use of the certificate. The treatment of certificates without
basicConstraints as a CA is presently supported, but this could change
in the future.</p>
<p><em>Key Usage</em></p>
<p>If the keyUsage extension is present then additional restraints are
made on the uses of the certificate. A CA certificate
<strong>must</strong> have the keyCertSign bit set if the keyUsage
extension is present.</p>
<p><em>Extended Key Usage</em></p>
<p>The extKeyUsage (EKU) extension places additional restrictions on the
certificate uses. If this extension is present (whether critical or not)
the key can only be used for the purposes specified.</p>
<p>A complete description of each check is given below. The comments
about basicConstraints and keyUsage and X.509v1 certificates above apply
to <strong>all</strong> CA certificates.</p>
<dl>
<dt>SSL Client</dt>
<dd>
<p>The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
client authentication OID. The keyUsage extension must be absent or it
must have the digitalSignature bit set. The Netscape certificate type
must be absent or it must have the SSL client bit set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SSL Client CA</dt>
<dd>
<p>The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
client authentication OID. The Netscape certificate type must be absent
or it must have the SSL CA bit set. This is used as a work around if the
basicConstraints extension is absent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SSL Server</dt>
<dd>
<p>The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
server authentication and/or one of the SGC OIDs. The keyUsage extension
must be absent or it must have the digitalSignature, the keyEncipherment
set or both bits set. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or
have the SSL server bit set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SSL Server CA</dt>
<dd>
<p>The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
server authentication and/or one of the SGC OIDs. The Netscape
certificate type must be absent or the SSL CA bit must be set. This is
used as a work around if the basicConstraints extension is absent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Netscape SSL Server</dt>
<dd>
<p>For Netscape SSL clients to connect to an SSL server it must have the
keyEncipherment bit set if the keyUsage extension is present. This isn't
always valid because some cipher suites use the key for digital signing.
Otherwise it is the same as a normal SSL server.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Common S/MIME Client Tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the email
protection OID. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or should
have the S/MIME bit set. If the S/MIME bit is not set in the Netscape
certificate type then the SSL client bit is tolerated as an alternative
but a warning is shown. This is because some Verisign certificates don't
set the S/MIME bit.</p>
</dd>
<dt>S/MIME Signing</dt>
<dd>
<p>In addition to the common S/MIME client tests the digitalSignature
bit or the nonRepudiation bit must be set if the keyUsage extension is
present.</p>
</dd>
<dt>S/MIME Encryption</dt>
<dd>
<p>In addition to the common S/MIME tests the keyEncipherment bit must
be set if the keyUsage extension is present.</p>
</dd>
<dt>S/MIME CA</dt>
<dd>
<p>The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the email
protection OID. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or must
have the S/MIME CA bit set. This is used as a work around if the
basicConstraints extension is absent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>CRL Signing</dt>
<dd>
<p>The keyUsage extension must be absent or it must have the CRL signing
bit set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>CRL Signing CA</dt>
<dd>
<p>The normal CA tests apply. Except in this case the basicConstraints
extension must be present.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>The issuer checks still suffer from limitations in the underlying
X509_LOOKUP API. One consequence of this is that trusted certificates
with matching subject name must appear in a file (as specified by the
<strong>-CAfile</strong> option), a directory (as specified by
<strong>-CApath</strong>), or a store (as specified by
<strong>-CAstore</strong>). If there are multiple such matches, possibly
in multiple locations, only the first one (in the mentioned order of
locations) is recognised.</p>
