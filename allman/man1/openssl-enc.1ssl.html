<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The symmetric cipher commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted
using various block and stream ciphers using keys based on passwords or
explicitly provided. Base64 encoding or decoding can also be performed
either by itself or in addition to the encryption or decryption.</p>

<p>Same as <strong>-a</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt>-A</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the <strong>-a</strong> option is set then base64 process the data
on one line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-k password</dt>
<dd>
<p>The password to derive the key from. This is for compatibility with
previous versions of OpenSSL. Superseded by the <strong>-pass</strong>
argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-kfile filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>Read the password to derive the key from the first line of
<em>filename</em>. This is for compatibility with previous versions of
OpenSSL. Superseded by the <strong>-pass</strong> argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-md digest</dt>

</dd>
<dt>-iter count</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use a given number of iterations on the password in deriving the

</dd>
<dt>-K key</dt>
<dd>
<p>The actual key to use: this must be represented as a string comprised
only of hex digits. If only the key is specified, the IV must
additionally specified using the <strong>-iv</strong> option. When both
a key and a password are specified, the key given with the

<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The program can be called either as
<code>openssl </code><em><code>cipher</code></em> or
<code>openssl enc -</code><em><code>cipher</code></em>. The first form
doesn't work with engine-provided ciphers, because this form is
processed before the configuration file is read and any ENGINEs loaded.
Use the <strong>openssl-list</strong> (1) command to get a list of
supported ciphers.</p>
<p>Engines which provide entirely new encryption algorithms (such as the
ccgost engine which provides gost89 algorithm) should be configured in
the configuration file. Engines specified on the command line using
<strong>-engine</strong> option can only be used for hardware-assisted
implementations of ciphers which are supported by the OpenSSL core or
another engine specified in the configuration file.</p>
<p>When the enc command lists supported ciphers, ciphers provided by
engines, specified in the configuration files are listed too.</p>
<p>A password will be prompted for to derive the key and IV if
necessary.</p>
<p>The <strong>-salt</strong> option should <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be
used if the key is being derived from a password unless you want
compatibility with previous versions of OpenSSL.</p>
<p>Without the <strong>-salt</strong> option it is possible to perform
efficient dictionary attacks on the password and to attack stream cipher
encrypted data. The reason for this is that without the salt the same
password always generates the same encryption key.</p>
<p>When the salt is generated at random (that means when encrypting
using a passphrase without explicit salt given using <strong>-S</strong>
option), the first bytes of the encrypted data are reserved to store the
salt for later decrypting.</p>
<p>Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security
implications if not used correctly. A beginner is advised to just use a
strong block cipher, such as AES, in CBC mode.</p>
<p>All the block ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding, also known as
standard block padding. This allows a rudimentary integrity or password
check to be performed. However, since the chance of random data passing
the test is better than 1 in 256 it isn't a very good test.</p>
<p>If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the
cipher block length.</p>
<p>All RC2 ciphers have the same key and effective key length.</p>
<p>Blowfish and RC5 algorithms use a 128 bit key.</p>
<p>Please note that OpenSSL 3.0 changed the effect of the
<strong>-S</strong> option. Any explicit salt value specified via this
option is no longer prepended to the ciphertext when encrypting, and
must again be explicitly provided when decrypting. Conversely, when the
<strong>-S</strong> option is used during decryption, the ciphertext is
expected to not have a prepended salt value.</p>
<p>When using OpenSSL 3.0 or later to decrypt data that was encrypted
with an explicit salt under OpenSSL 1.1.1 do not use the
<strong>-S</strong> option, the salt will then be read from the
ciphertext. To generate ciphertext that can be decrypted with OpenSSL
1.1.1 do not use the <strong>-S</strong> option, the salt will be then
be generated randomly and prepended to the output.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED CIPHERS</h1>
<p>Note that some of these ciphers can be disabled at compile time and
some are available only if an appropriate engine is configured in the
configuration file. The output when invoking this command with the
<strong>-list</strong> option (that is <code>openssl enc -list</code>)
is a list of ciphers, supported by your version of OpenSSL, including
ones provided by configured engines.</p>
<p>This command does not support authenticated encryption modes like CCM
and GCM, and will not support such modes in the future. This is due to
having to begin streaming output (e.g., to standard output when
<strong>-out</strong> is not used) before the authentication tag could
be validated. When this command is used in a pipeline, the receiving end
will not be able to roll back upon authentication failure. The AEAD
modes currently in common use also suffer from catastrophic failure of
confidentiality and/or integrity upon reuse of key/iv/nonce, and since
<strong>openssl enc</strong> places the entire burden of key/iv/nonce
management upon the user, the risk of exposing AEAD modes is too great
to allow. These key/iv/nonce management issues also affect other modes
currently exposed in this command, but the failure modes are less
extreme in these cases, and the functionality cannot be removed with a
stable release branch. For bulk encryption of data, whether using
authenticated encryption modes or other modes,
<strong>openssl-cms</strong> (1) is recommended, as it provides a
standard data format and performs the needed key/iv/nonce
management.</p>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Just base64 encode a binary file:</p>
<p>openssl base64 -in file.bin -out file.b64</p>
<p>Decode the same file</p>
<p>openssl base64 -d -in file.b64 -out file.bin</p>
<p>Encrypt a file using AES-128 using a prompted password and PBKDF2 key
derivation:</p>
<p>openssl enc -aes128 -pbkdf2 -in file.txt -out file.aes128</p>
<p>Decrypt a file using a supplied password:</p>
<p>openssl enc -aes128 -pbkdf2 -d -in file.aes128 -out file.txt \ -pass
pass:&lt;password&gt;</p>
<p>Encrypt a file then base64 encode it (so it can be sent via mail for
example) using AES-256 in CTR mode and PBKDF2 key derivation:</p>
<p>openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -a -in file.txt -out file.aes256</p>
<p>Base64 decode a file then decrypt it using a password supplied in a
file:</p>
<p>openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -d -a -in file.aes256 -out file.txt
\ -pass file:&lt;passfile&gt;</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>The <strong>-A</strong> option when used with large files doesn't
work properly.</p>
<p>The <strong>openssl enc</strong> command only supports a fixed number
of algorithms with certain parameters. So if, for example, you want to
use RC2 with a 76 bit key or RC4 with an 84 bit key you can't use this
program.</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The default digest was changed from MD5 to SHA256 in OpenSSL
1.1.0.</p>
<p>The <strong>-list</strong> option was added in OpenSSL 1.1.1e.</p>
<p>The <strong>-ciphers</strong> and <strong>-engine</strong> options
were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.</p>
