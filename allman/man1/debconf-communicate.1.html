<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>debconf-communicate - communicate with debconf</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>echo commands | debconf-communicate [options] [package]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>debconf-communicate</strong> allows you to communicate with
debconf on the fly, from the command line. The package argument is the
name of the package which you are pretending to be as you communicate
with debconf, and it may be omitted if you are lazy. It reads commands
in the form used by the debconf protocol from stdin. For documentation
on the available commands and their usage, see the debconf
specification.</p>
<p>The commands are executed in sequence. The textual return code of
each is printed out to standard output.</p>
<p>The return value of this program is the numeric return code of the
last executed command.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>echo get debconf/frontend | debconf-communicate</p>
<p>Print out the value of the debconf/frontend question.</p>
<h1>WARNING</h1>
<p>This program should never be used from a maintainer script of a
package that uses debconf! It may however, be useful in debugging.</p>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p><strong>debconf-loadtemplate</strong>â€†(1)</p>
