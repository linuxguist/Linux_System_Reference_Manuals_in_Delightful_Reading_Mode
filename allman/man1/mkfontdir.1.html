<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>mkfontdir - create an index of X font files in a directory</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>mkfontdir</strong> [<strong>-n</strong>] [<strong>-x</strong>
<em>suffix</em>] [<strong>-r</strong>] [<strong>-p</strong>
<em>prefix</em>] [<strong>-e</strong> <em>encoding-directory-name</em>]
 . . . [<strong>--</strong>] [<em>directory-name</em>  . . . ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>For each directory argument, <em>mkfontdir</em> reads all of the font
files in the directory searching for properties named "FONT", or
(failing that) the name of the file stripped of its suffix. These are
converted to lower case and used as font names, and, along with the name
of the font file, are written out to the file "fonts.dir" in the
directory. The X server and font server use "fonts.dir" to find font
files.</p>
<p>The kinds of font files read by <em>mkfontdir</em> depend on
configuration parameters, but typically include PCF (suffix ".pcf"), SNF
(suffix ".snf") and BDF (suffix ".bdf"). If a font exists in multiple
formats, <em>mkfontdir</em> will first choose PCF, then SNF and finally
BDF.</p>
<p>The first line of fonts.dir gives the number of fonts in the file.
The remaining lines list the fonts themselves, one per line, in two
fields. First is the name of the font file, followed by a space and the
name of the font.</p>
<h1>SCALABLE FONTS</h1>
<p>Because scalable font files do not usually include the X font name,
the file "fonts.scale" can be used to name the scalable fonts in the
directory. The fonts listed in it are copied to fonts.dir by
<em>mkfontdir</em>. "fonts.scale" has the same format as the "fonts.dir"
file, and can be created with the <em>mkfontscale</em>(1) program.</p>
<h1>FONT NAME ALIASES</h1>
<p>The file "fonts.alias", which can be put in any directory of the
font-path, is used to map new names to existing fonts, and should be
edited by hand. The format is two white-space separated columns, the
first containing aliases and the second containing font-name patterns.
Lines beginning with "!" are comment lines and are ignored.</p>
<p>If neither the alias nor the value specifies the size fields of the
font name, this is a scalable alias. A font name of any size that
matches this alias will be mapped to the same size of the font that the
alias resolves to.</p>
<p>When a font alias is used, the name it references is searched for in
the normal manner, looking through each font directory in turn. This
means that the aliases need not mention fonts in the same directory as
the alias file.</p>
<p>To embed white space in either name, simply enclose it in
double-quote marks; to embed double-quote marks (or any other
character), precede them with back-slash:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;magic-alias with spaces&quot;	&quot;\&quot;font name\&quot; with quotes&quot;
regular-alias			fixed</code></pre>
<p>If the string "FILE_NAMES_ALIASES" stands alone on a line, each
file-name in the directory (stripped of its suffix) will be used as an
alias for that font.</p>
<h1>ENCODING FILES</h1>
<p>The option <strong>-e</strong> can be used to specify a directory
with encoding files. Every such directory is scanned for encoding files,
the list of which is then written to an "encodings.dir" file in every
font directory. The "encodings.dir" file is used by the server to find
encoding information.</p>
<p>The "encodings.dir" file has the same format as "fonts.dir". It maps
encoding names (strings of the form
<strong>CHARSET_REGISTRY</strong><em>-</em><strong>CHARSET_ENCODING</strong>
) to encoding file names.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-e</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify a directory containing encoding files. The
<strong>-e</strong> option may be specified multiple times, and all the
specified directories will be read. The order of the entries is
significant, as encodings found in earlier directories override those in
later ones; encoding files in the same directory are discriminated by
preferring compressed versions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-n</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>do not scan for fonts, do not write font directory files. This option
is useful when generating encoding directories only.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-p</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify a prefix that is prepended to the encoding file path names
when they are written to the "encodings.dir" file. The prefix is
prepended as-is. If a `/' is required between the prefix and the path
names, it must be supplied explicitly as part of the prefix.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-r</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Keep non-absolute encoding directories in their relative form when
writing the "encodings.dir" file. The default is to convert relative
encoding directories to absolute directories by prepending the current
directory. The positioning of this options is significant, as this
option only applies to subsequent <strong>-e</strong> options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-x </strong><em>suffix</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ignore fonts files of type <em>suffix</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>End options.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>fonts.dir</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List of fonts in the directory and the files they are stored in.
Created by <em>mkfontdir</em>. Read by the X server and font server each
time the font path is set (see xset(1)).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>fonts.scale</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List of scalable fonts in the directory. Contents are copied to
fonts.dir by <em>mkfontdir</em>. Can be created with
<em>mkfontscale</em>(1).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>fonts.alias</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List of font name aliases. Read by the X server and font server each
time the font path is set (see xset(1)).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>encodings.dir</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List of known encodings and the files they are stored in. Created by
<em>mkfontdir</em>. Read by the X server and font server each time a
font with an unknown charset is opened.</p>
</dd>
