<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>unshare - run program in new namespaces</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>unshare</strong> [options] [<em>program</em>
[<em>arguments</em>]]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>unshare</strong> command creates new namespaces (as
specified by the command-line options described below) and then executes
the specified <em>program</em>. If <em>program</em> is not given, then
"${SHELL}" is run (default: <em>/bin/sh</em>).</p>
<p>By default, a new namespace persists only as long as it has member
processes. A new namespace can be made persistent even when it has no
member processes by bind mounting /proc/<em>pid</em>/ns/<em>type</em>
files to a filesystem path. A namespace that has been made persistent in
this way can subsequently be entered with <strong>nsenter</strong>(1)
even after the <em>program</em> terminates (except PID namespaces where
a permanently running init process is required). Once a persistent
namespace is no longer needed, it can be unpersisted by using
<strong>umount</strong>(8) to remove the bind mount. See the
<strong>EXAMPLES</strong> section for more details.</p>
<p><strong>unshare</strong> since util-linux version 2.36 uses
<em>/proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children</em> and
<em>/proc/[pid]/ns/time_for_children</em> files for persistent PID and
TIME namespaces. This change requires Linux kernel 4.17 or newer.</p>
<p>The following types of namespaces can be created with
<strong>unshare</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>mount namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest of the
system, except for filesystems which are explicitly marked as shared
(with <strong>mount --make-shared</strong>; see
<em>/proc/self/mountinfo</em> or <strong>findmnt -o+PROPAGATION</strong>
for the <strong>shared</strong> flags). For further details, see
<strong>mount_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
<p><strong>unshare</strong> since util-linux version 2.27 automatically
sets propagation to <strong>private</strong> in a new mount namespace to
make sure that the new namespace is really unshared. Itâ€™s possible to
disable this feature with option <strong>--propagation
unchanged</strong>. Note that <strong>private</strong> is the kernel
default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UTS namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting hostname or domainname will not affect the rest of the
system. For further details, see <strong>uts_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>IPC namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process will have an independent namespace for POSIX message
queues as well as System V message queues, semaphore sets and shared
memory segments. For further details, see
<strong>ipc_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>network namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, IP routing
tables, firewall rules, the <em>/proc/net</em> and
<em>/sys/class/net</em> directory trees, sockets, etc. For further
details, see <strong>network_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PID namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children will have a distinct set of PID-to-process mappings from
their parent. For further details, see
<strong>pid_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>cgroup namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process will have a virtualized view of
<em>/proc/self/cgroup</em>, and new cgroup mounts will be rooted at the
namespace cgroup root. For further details, see
<strong>cgroup_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>user namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and capabilities.
For further details, see <strong>user_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>time namespace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process can have a distinct view of
<strong>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</strong> and/or <strong>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</strong>
which can be changed using <em>/proc/self/timens_offsets</em>. For
further details, see <strong>time_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-i</strong>,
<strong>--ipc</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new IPC namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
<em>file</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-m</strong>,
<strong>--mount</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new mount namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at <em>file</em>.
Note that <em>file</em> must be located on a mount whose propagation
type is not <strong>shared</strong> (or an error results). Use the
command <strong>findmnt -o+PROPAGATION</strong> when not sure about the
current setting. See also the examples below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-n</strong>,
<strong>--net</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new network namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then
the namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
<em>file</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-p</strong>,
<strong>--pid</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new PID namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at <em>file</em>.
(Creation of a persistent PID namespace will fail if the
<strong>--fork</strong> option is not also specified.)</p>
<p>See also the <strong>--fork</strong> and
<strong>--mount-proc</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-u</strong>,
<strong>--uts</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new UTS namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
<em>file</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-U</strong>,
<strong>--user</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new user namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
<em>file</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-C</strong>,
<strong>--cgroup</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new cgroup namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then
the namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
<em>file</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-T</strong>,
<strong>--time</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>file</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new time namespace. If <em>file</em> is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at <em>file</em>.
The <strong>--monotonic</strong> and <strong>--boottime</strong> options
can be used to specify the corresponding offset in the time
namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-f</strong>, <strong>--fork</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fork the specified <em>program</em> as a child process of
<strong>unshare</strong> rather than running it directly. This is useful
when creating a new PID namespace. Note that when
<strong>unshare</strong> is waiting for the child process, then it
ignores <strong>SIGINT</strong> and <strong>SIGTERM</strong> and does
not forward any signals to the child. It is necessary to send signals to
the child process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--keep-caps</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the <strong>--user</strong> option is given, ensure that
capabilities granted in the user namespace are preserved in the child
process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--kill-child</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>signame</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>unshare</strong> terminates, have <em>signame</em> be
sent to the forked child process. Combined with <strong>--pid</strong>
this allows for an easy and reliable killing of the entire process tree
below <strong>unshare</strong>. If not given, <em>signame</em> defaults
to <strong>SIGKILL</strong>. This option implies
<strong>--fork</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--mount-proc</strong>[<strong>=</strong><em>mountpoint</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just before running the program, mount the proc filesystem at
<em>mountpoint</em> (default is <em>/proc</em>). This is useful when
creating a new PID namespace. It also implies creating a new mount
namespace since the <em>/proc</em> mount would otherwise mess up
existing programs on the system. The new proc filesystem is explicitly
mounted as private (with
<strong>MS_PRIVATE</strong>|<strong>MS_REC</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--map-user=</strong><em>uid|name</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the program only after the current effective user ID has been
mapped to <em>uid</em>. If this option is specified multiple times, the
last occurrence takes precedence. This option implies
<strong>--user</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--map-users=</strong><em>outeruid,inneruid,count</em>|<strong>auto</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the program only after the block of user IDs of size
<em>count</em> beginning at <em>outeruid</em> has been mapped to the
block of user IDs beginning at <em>inneruid</em>. This mapping is
created with <strong>newuidmap</strong>(1). If the range of user IDs
overlaps with the mapping specified by <strong>--map-user</strong>, then
a "hole" will be removed from the mapping. This may result in the
highest user ID of the mapping not being mapped. The special value
<strong>auto</strong> will map the first block of user IDs owned by the
effective user from <em>/etc/subuid</em> to a block starting at user ID
0. If this option is specified multiple times, the last occurrence takes
precedence. This option implies <strong>--user</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--map-group=</strong><em>gid|name</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the program only after the current effective group ID has been
mapped to <em>gid</em>. If this option is specified multiple times, the
last occurrence takes precedence. This option implies
<strong>--setgroups=deny</strong> and <strong>--user</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--map-groups=</strong><em>outergid,innergid,count</em>|<strong>auto</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the program only after the block of group IDs of size
<em>count</em> beginning at <em>outergid</em> has been mapped to the
block of group IDs beginning at <em>innergid</em>. This mapping is
created with <strong>newgidmap</strong>(1). If the range of group IDs
overlaps with the mapping specified by <strong>--map-group</strong>,
then a "hole" will be removed from the mapping. This may result in the
highest group ID of the mapping not being mapped. The special value
<strong>auto</strong> will map the first block of user IDs owned by the
effective user from <em>/etc/subgid</em> to a block starting at group ID
0. If this option is specified multiple times, the last occurrence takes
precedence. This option implies <strong>--user</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--map-auto</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Map the first block of user IDs owned by the effective user from
<em>/etc/subuid</em> to a block starting at user ID 0. In the same
manner, also map the first block of group IDs owned by the effective
group from <em>/etc/subgid</em> to a block starting at group ID 0. This
option is intended to handle the common case where the first block of
subordinate user and group IDs can map the whole user and group ID
space. This option is equivalent to specifying
<strong>--map-users=auto</strong> and
<strong>--map-groups=auto</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-r</strong>, <strong>--map-root-user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs
have been mapped to the superuser UID and GID in the newly created user
namespace. This makes it possible to conveniently gain capabilities
needed to manage various aspects of the newly created namespaces (such
as configuring interfaces in the network namespace or mounting
filesystems in the mount namespace) even when run unprivileged. As a
mere convenience feature, it does not support more sophisticated use
cases, such as mapping multiple ranges of UIDs and GIDs. This option
implies <strong>--setgroups=deny</strong> and <strong>--user</strong>.
This option is equivalent to <strong>--map-user=0
--map-group=0</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--map-current-user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs
have been mapped to the same UID and GID in the newly created user
namespace. This option implies <strong>--setgroups=deny</strong> and
<strong>--user</strong>. This option is equivalent to
<strong>--map-user=$(id -ru) --map-group=$(id -rg)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--propagation
private</strong>|<strong>shared</strong>|<strong>slave</strong>|<strong>unchanged</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recursively set the mount propagation flag in the new mount
namespace. The default is to set the propagation to <em>private</em>. It
is possible to disable this feature with the argument
<strong>unchanged</strong>. The option is silently ignored when the
mount namespace (<strong>--mount</strong>) is not requested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--setgroups allow</strong>|<strong>deny</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow or deny the <strong>setgroups</strong>(2) system call in a user
namespace.</p>
<p>To be able to call <strong>setgroups</strong>(2), the calling process
must at least have <strong>CAP_SETGID</strong>. But since Linux 3.19 a
further restriction applies: the kernel gives permission to call
<strong>setgroups</strong>(2) only after the GID map
(<strong>/proc/</strong><em>pid</em>*/gid_map*) has been set. The GID
map is writable by root when <strong>setgroups</strong>(2) is enabled
(i.e., <strong>allow</strong>, the default), and the GID map becomes
writable by unprivileged processes when <strong>setgroups</strong>(2) is
permanently disabled (with <strong>deny</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-R</strong>, <strong>--root=</strong><em>dir</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>run the command with root directory set to <em>dir</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-w</strong>, <strong>--wd=</strong><em>dir</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>change working directory to <em>dir</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-S</strong>, <strong>--setuid</strong> <em>uid</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the user ID which will be used in the entered namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-G</strong>, <strong>--setgid</strong> <em>gid</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the group ID which will be used in the entered namespace and drop
supplementary groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--monotonic</strong> <em>offset</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the offset of <strong>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</strong> which will be used
in the entered time namespace. This option requires unsharing a time
namespace with <strong>--time</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--boottime</strong> <em>offset</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the offset of <strong>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</strong> which will be used
in the entered time namespace. This option requires unsharing a time
namespace with <strong>--time</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print version and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The proc and sysfs filesystems mounting as root in a user namespace
have to be restricted so that a less privileged user cannot get more
access to sensitive files that a more privileged user made unavailable.
In short the rule for proc and sysfs is as close to a bind mount as
possible.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The following command creates a PID namespace, using
<strong>--fork</strong> to ensure that the executed command is performed
in a child process that (being the first process in the namespace) has
PID 1. The <strong>--mount-proc</strong> option ensures that a new mount
namespace is also simultaneously created and that a new
<strong>proc</strong>(5) filesystem is mounted that contains information
corresponding to the new PID namespace. When the
<strong>readlink</strong>(1) command terminates, the new namespaces are
automatically torn down.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># unshare --fork --pid --mount-proc readlink /proc/self
1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As an unprivileged user, create a new user namespace where the userâ€™s
credentials are mapped to the root IDs inside the namespace:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ id -u; id -g
1000
1000
$ unshare --user --map-root-user \
        sh -c &#39;&#39;whoami; cat /proc/self/uid_map /proc/self/gid_map&#39;&#39;
root
         0       1000          1
         0       1000          1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As an unprivileged user, create a user namespace where the first
65536 IDs are all mapped, and the userâ€™s credentials are mapped to the
root IDs inside the namespace. The map is determined by the subordinate
IDs assigned in <strong>subuid</strong>(5) and
<strong>subgid</strong>(5). Demonstrate this mapping by creating a file
with user ID 1 and group ID 1. For brevity, only the user ID mappings
are shown:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ id -u
1000
$ cat /etc/subuid
1000:100000:65536
$ unshare --user --map-auto --map-root-user
# id -u
0
# cat /proc/self/uid_map
         0       1000          1
         1     100000      65535
# touch file; chown 1:1 file
# ls -ln --time-style=+ file
-rw-r--r-- 1 1 1 0  file
# exit
$ ls -ln --time-style=+ file
-rw-r--r-- 1 100000 100000 0  file</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first of the following commands creates a new persistent UTS
namespace and modifies the hostname as seen in that namespace. The
namespace is then entered with <strong>nsenter</strong>(1) in order to
display the modified hostname; this step demonstrates that the UTS
namespace continues to exist even though the namespace had no member
processes after the <strong>unshare</strong> command terminated. The
namespace is then destroyed by removing the bind mount.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># touch /root/uts-ns
# unshare --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname FOO
# nsenter --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname
FOO
# umount /root/uts-ns</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following commands establish a persistent mount namespace
referenced by the bind mount <em>/root/namespaces/mnt</em>. In order to
ensure that the creation of that bind mount succeeds, the parent
directory (<em>/root/namespaces</em>) is made a bind mount whose
propagation type is not <strong>shared</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># mount --bind /root/namespaces /root/namespaces
# mount --make-private /root/namespaces
# touch /root/namespaces/mnt
# unshare --mount=/root/namespaces/mnt</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following commands demonstrate the use of the
<strong>--kill-child</strong> option when creating a PID namespace, in
order to ensure that when <strong>unshare</strong> is killed, all of the
processes within the PID namespace are killed.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># set +m                # Don&#39;t print job status messages


# unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc --kill-child -- \


       bash --norc -c &#39;&#39;(sleep 555 &amp;) &amp;&amp; (ps a &amp;) &amp;&amp; sleep 999&#39;&#39; &amp;
[1] 53456
#     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
      1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
      3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
      5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a

# ps h -o &#39;comm&#39; $!     # Show that background job is unshare(1)
unshare
# kill $!               # Kill unshare(1)
# pidof sleep</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>pidof</strong>(1) command prints no output, because the
<strong>sleep</strong> processes have been killed. More precisely, when
the <strong>sleep</strong> process that has PID 1 in the namespace
(i.e., the namespaceâ€™s init process) was killed, this caused all other
processes in the namespace to be killed. By contrast, a similar series
of commands where the <strong>--kill-child</strong> option is not used
shows that when <strong>unshare</strong> terminates, the processes in
the PID namespace are not killed:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc -- \


       bash --norc -c &#39;&#39;(sleep 555 &amp;) &amp;&amp; (ps a &amp;) &amp;&amp; sleep 999&#39;&#39; &amp;
[1] 53479
#     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
      1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
      3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
      5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a

# kill $!
# pidof sleep
53482 53480</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following example demonstrates the creation of a time namespace
where the boottime clock is set to a point several years in the
past:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># uptime -p             # Show uptime in initial time namespace
up 21 hours, 30 minutes
# unshare --time --fork --boottime 300000000 uptime -p
up 9 years, 28 weeks, 1 day, 2 hours, 50 minutes</code></pre>
