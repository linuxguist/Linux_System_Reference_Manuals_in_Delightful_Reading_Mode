<p>replaces the old ssh command-name as hostname handling. If you link
to this script with a hostname then executing the link is equivalent to

<p>OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release
by Tatu Ylonen. Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos,
Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer features
and created OpenSSH. Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH
protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0. Natalie Amery wrote this ssh-argv0 script
and the associated documentation.</p>
