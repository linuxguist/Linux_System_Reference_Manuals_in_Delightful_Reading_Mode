<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Ispell</em> is fashioned after the <em>spell</em> program from
ITS (called <em>ispell</em> on Twenex systems.) The most common usage is
"ispell filename". In this case, <em>ispell</em> will display each word
which does not appear in the dictionary at the top of the screen and
allow you to change it. If there are "near misses" in the dictionary
(words which differ by only a single letter, a missing or extra letter,
a pair of transposed letters, or a missing space or hyphen), then they
are also displayed on following lines. As well as "near misses", ispell
may display other guesses at ways to make the word from a known root,
with each guess preceded by question marks. Finally, the line containing
the word and the previous line are printed at the bottom of the screen.
If your terminal can display in reverse video, the word itself is
highlighted. You have the option of replacing the word completely, or
choosing one of the suggested words. Commands are single characters as
follows (case is ignored):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="18" type="A">
<li><p>Replace the misspelled word completely.</p></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>Space</dt>
<dd>
<p>Accept the word this time only.</p>

lower-case) version to the private dictionary.</p></li>

</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>If the <strong>-M</strong> switch is specified, a one-line mini-menu
at the bottom of the screen will summarize these options. Conversely,
the <strong>-N</strong> switch may be used to suppress the mini-menu.
(The minimenu is displayed by default if <em>ispell</em> was compiled
with the MINIMENU option, but these two switches will always override
the default).</p>
<p>If the <strong>-L</strong> flag is given, the specified number is
used as the number of lines of context to be shown at the bottom of the
screen (The default is to calculate the amount of context as a certain
percentage of the screen size). The amount of context is subject to a
system-imposed limit.</p>
<p>If the <strong>-V</strong> flag is given, characters that are not in
the 7-bit ANSI printable character set will always be displayed in the
style of "cat -v", even if <em>ispell</em> thinks that these characters
are valid ISO Latin-1 on your system. This is useful when working with
older terminals. Without this switch, <em>ispell</em> will display 8-bit
characters "as is" if they have been defined as string characters for
the chosen file type.</p>
<p>"Normal" mode, as well as the <strong>-l</strong>,
<strong>-a</strong>, and <strong>-A</strong> options and interactive
mode (see below) also accepts the following "common" flags on the
command line:</p>
<blockquote>

<strong>-s</strong>, but for historical reasons that flag was already
taken.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-H</strong>, <strong>-n</strong>, <strong>-t</strong>,
and <strong>-o</strong> options select whether <em>ispell</em> runs in
HTML (<strong>-H</strong>), nroff/troff (<strong>-n</strong>), TeX/LaTeX
(<strong>-t</strong>), or ordinary text (<strong>-o</strong>) input
mode. mode. (The default mode is controlled by the DEFTEXFLAG
installation option, but is normally nroff/troff mode for historical
reasons.) Unless overridden by one of the mode-selection switches,
TeX/LaTeX mode is automatically selected if an input file has the
extension ".tex", and HTML mode is automatically selected if an input
file has the extension ".html" or ".htm".</p>
<p>In HTML mode, HTML tags delimited by &lt;&gt; signs are skipped,
except that the "ALT=" construct is recognized if it appears with no
spaces around the equals sign, and the text inside is spell-checked.</p>
<p>In TeX/LaTeX mode, whenever a backslash ("\") is found,
<em>ispell</em> will skip to the next whitespace or TeX/LaTeX delimiter.
Certain commands contain arguments which should not be checked, such as
labels and reference keys as are found in the \cite command, since they
contain arbitrary, non-word arguments. Spell checking is also suppressed
when in math mode. Thus, for example, given</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\chapter {This is a Ckapter} \cite{SCH86}</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ispell</em> will find "Ckapter" but not "SCH". The
<strong>-t</strong> option does not recognize the TeX comment character
"%", so comments are also spell-checked. It also assumes correct LaTeX
syntax. Arguments to infrequently used commands and some optional
arguments are sometimes checked unnecessarily. The bibliography will not
be checked if <em>ispell</em> was compiled with
<strong>IGNOREBIB</strong> defined. Otherwise, the bibliography will be
checked but the reference key will not.</p>
<p>References for the <em>tib</em> (if available on your
system)<em>,</em> bibliography system, that is, text between a ``[.'' or
``&lt;.'' and ``.]'' or ``.&gt;'' will always be ignored in TeX/LaTeX
mode.</p>
<p>The <strong>-b</strong> and <strong>-x</strong> options control
whether <em>ispell</em> leaves a backup (.bak) file for each input file.
The .bak file contains the pre-corrected text. If there are file opening
or writing errors, the .bak file may be left for recovery purposes even
with the <strong>-x</strong> option. The default for this option is
controlled by the DEFNOBACKUPFLAG installation option.</p>
<p>The <strong>-B</strong> and <strong>-C</strong> options control how
<em>ispell</em> handles run-together words, such as "notthe" for "not
the". If <strong>-B</strong> is specified, such words will be considered
as errors, and <em>ispell</em> will list variations with an inserted
blank or hyphen as possible replacements. If <strong>-C</strong> is
specified, run-together words will be considered to be valid compounds,
so long as both components are in the dictionary, and each component is
at least as long as a language-dependent minimum (3 characters, by
default). This is useful for languages such as German and Norwegian,
where many compound words are formed by concatenation. (Note that
compounds formed from three or more root words will still be considered
errors). The default for this option is language-dependent; in a
multi-lingual installation the default may vary depending on which
dictionary you choose. <strong>Warning:</strong> the <strong>-C</strong>
option can cause <em>ispell</em> to recognize non-words and
misspellings. Use it with caution!</p>
<p>The <strong>-P</strong> and <strong>-m</strong> options control when
<em>ispell</em> automatically generates suggested root/affix
combinations for possible addition to your personal dictionary. (These
are the entries in the "guess" list which are preceded by question
marks.) If <strong>-P</strong> is specified, such guesses are displayed
only if <em>ispell</em> cannot generate any possibilities that match the
current dictionary. If <strong>-m</strong> is specified, such guesses
are always displayed. This can be useful if the dictionary has a limited
word list, or a word list with few suffixes. However, you should be
careful when using this option, as it can generate guesses that produce
invalid words. The default for this option is controlled by the
dictionary file used.</p>
<p>The <strong>-S</strong> option suppresses <em>ispell</em>'s normal
behavior of sorting the list of possible replacement words. Some people
may prefer this, since it somewhat enhances the probability that the
correct word will be low-numbered.</p>
<p>The <strong>-d</strong> option is used to specify an alternate hashed
dictionary file, other than the default. If the filename does not
contain a "/", the library directory for the default dictionary file is
prefixed; thus, to use a dictionary in the local directory "-d
./xxx.hash" must be used. This is useful to allow dictionaries for
alternate languages. Unlike previous versions of <em>ispell</em>, a
dictionary of <em>/dev/null</em> is invalid, because the dictionary
contains the affix table. If you need an effectively empty dictionary,
create a one-entry list with an unlikely string (e.g., "qqqqq").</p>
<p>The <strong>-p</strong> option is used to specify an alternate
personal dictionary file. If the file name does not begin with "/",
$HOME is prefixed. Also, the shell variable WORDLIST may be set, which
renames the personal dictionary in the same manner. The command line
overrides any WORDLIST setting. If neither the <strong>-p</strong>
switch nor the WORDLIST environment variable is given, <em>ispell</em>
will search for a personal dictionary in both the current directory and
$HOME, creating one in $HOME if none is found. The preferred name is
constructed by appending ".ispell_" to the base name of the hash file.
For example, if you use the English dictionary, your personal dictionary
would be named ".ispell_english". However, if the file ".ispell_words"
exists, it will be used as the personal dictionary regardless of the
language hash file chosen. This feature is included primarily for
backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>If the <strong>-p</strong> option is <em>not</em> specified,
<em>ispell</em> will look for personal dictionaries in both the current
directory and the home directory. If dictionaries exist in both places,
they will be merged. If any words are added to the personal dictionary,
they will be written to the current directory if a dictionary already
existed in that place; otherwise they will be written to the dictionary
in the home directory.</p>
<p>The <strong>-w</strong> option may be used to specify characters
other than alphabetics which may also appear in words. For instance,
<strong>-w</strong> "&amp;" will allow "AT&amp;T" to be picked up.
Underscores are useful in many technical documents. There is an
admittedly crude provision in this option for 8-bit international
characters. Non-printing characters may be specified in the usual way by
inserting a backslash followed by the octal character code; e.g., "\014"
for a form feed. Alternatively, if "n" appears in the character string,
the (up to) three characters following are a DECIMAL code 0â€“255, for the
character. For example, to include bells and form feeds in your words
(an admittedly silly thing to do, but aren't most pedagogical
examples):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>n007n012</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numeric digits other than the three following "n" are simply numeric
characters. Use of "n" does not conflict with anything because actual
alphabetics have no meaning - alphabetics are already accepted.
<em>Ispell</em> will typically be used with input from a file, meaning
that preserving parity for possible 8 bit characters from the input text
is OK. If you specify the -l option, and actually type text from the
terminal, this may create problems if your stty settings preserve
parity.</p>
<p>It is not possible to use <strong>-w</strong> with certain
characters. In particular, the flag-marker character for the language
(defined in the affix file, but usually "/") can never be made into a
word character.</p>
<p>The <strong>-W</strong> option may be used to change the length of
words that <em>ispell</em> always accepts as valid. Normally,
<em>ispell</em> will accept all 1-character words as valid, which is
equivalent to specifying "<strong>-W 1</strong>." (The default for this
switch is actually controlled by the MINWORD installation option, so it
may vary at your installation.) If you want all words to be checked
against the dictionary, regardless of length, you might want to specify
"<strong>-W 0</strong>". On the other hand, if your document specifies a
lot of three-letter acronyms, you would specify "<strong>-W 3</strong>"
to accept all words of three letters or less. Regardless of the setting
of this option, <em>ispell</em> will only generate words that are in the
dictionary as suggested replacements for words; this prevents the list
from becoming too long. Obviously, this option can be very dangerous,
since short misspellings may be missed. If you use this option a lot,
you should probably make a last pass without it before you publish your
document, to protect yourself against errors.</p>
<p>The <strong>-T</strong> option is used to specify a default formatter
type for use in generating string characters. This switch overrides the
default type determined from the file name. The <em>type</em> argument
may be either one of the unique names defined in the language affix file
(e.g., <strong>nroff</strong>) or a file suffix including the dot (e.g.,
<strong>.tex</strong>). If no <strong>-T</strong> option appears and no
type can be determined from the file name, the default string character
type declared in the language affix file will be used.</p>
<p>The <strong>-k</strong> option is used to enhance the behavior of
certain deformatters. The <em>name</em> parameter gives the name of a
deformatter keyword set (see below), and the <em>list</em> parameter
gives a list of one or more keywords that are to be treated specially.
If <em>list</em> begins with a plus (+) sign, it is added to the
existing keywords; otherwise it replaces the existing keyword list. For
example, <strong>-ktexskip1 +bibliographystyle</strong> adds
"bibliographystyle" to the TeX skip-1 list, while <strong>-khtmlignore
pre,strong</strong> replaces the HTML ignore list with "pre" and
"strong". The lists available are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>texskip1</dt>
<dd>
<p>TeX/LaTeX commands that take a single argument that should not be
spell-checked, such as "bibliographystyle". The default is "end",
"vspace", "hspace", "cite", "ref", "parbox", "label", "input", "nocite",
"include", "includeonly", "documentstyle", "documentclass",
"usepackage", "selectlanguage", "pagestyle", "pagenumbering",
"hyphenation", "pageref", and "psfig", plus "bibliography" in some
installations. These keywords are case-sensitive.</p>
</dd>
<dt>texskip2</dt>
<dd>
<p>TeX/LaTeX commands that take two arguments that should not be
spell-checked, such as "setlength". The default is "rule", "setcounter",
"addtocounter", "setlength", "addtolength", and "settowidth". These
keywords are case-sensitive.</p>
</dd>
<dt>htmlignore</dt>
<dd>
<p>HTML tags that delimit text that should not be spell-checked until
the matching end tag is reached. The default is "code", "samp", "kbd",
"pre", "listing", and "address". These keywords are case-insensitive.
(Note that the content inside HTML tags, such as HREF=, is not normally
checked.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>htmlcheck</dt>
<dd>
<p>Subfields that should be spell-checked even inside HTML tags. The
default is "alt", so that the ALT= portion of IMG tags will be
spell-checked. These keywords are case-insensitive.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of the above keyword lists can also be modified by environment
variables whose names are the same as above, except in uppercase, e.g.,
TEXSKIP1. The <strong>-k</strong> switch overrides (or adds to) the
environment variables, and the environment variables override or add to
the built-in defaults.</p>
<p>The <strong>-F</strong> switch specifies an external deformatter
program. This program should read data from its standard input and write
to its standard output. The program <em>must</em> produce exactly one
character of output for each character of input, or ispell will lose
synchronization and corrupt the output file. Whitespace characters
(especially blanks, tabs, and newlines) and characters that should be
spell-checked should be passed through unchanged. Characters that should
not be spell-checked should be converted into blanks or other non-word
characters. For example, an HTML deformatter might turn all HTML tags
into blanks, and also blank out all text delimited by tags such as
"code" or "kbd".</p>
<p>The <strong>-F</strong> switch is the preferred way to deformat files
for ispell, and eventually will become the only way.</p>
<p>If <em>ispell</em> is invoked without any filenames or mode switches,
it enters an interactive mode designed to let the user check the
spelling of individual words. The program repeatedly prompts on standard
output with "word:" and responds with either "ok" (possibly with
commentary), "not found", or "how about" followed by a list of
suggestions.</p>
<p>The <strong>-l</strong> or "list" option to <em>ispell</em> is used
to produce a list of misspelled words from the standard input.</p>
<p>The <strong>-a</strong> option is intended to be used from other
programs through a pipe. In this mode, <em>ispell</em> prints a one-line
version identification message, and then begins reading lines of input.
For each input line, a single line is written to the standard output for
each word checked for spelling on the line. If the word was found in the
main dictionary, or your personal dictionary, then the line contains
only a '*'. If the word was found through affix removal, then the line
contains a '+', a space, and the root word. If the word was found
through compound formation (concatenation of two words, controlled by
the <strong>-C</strong> option), then the line contains only a '-'.</p>
<p>If the word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses, then
the line contains an '&amp;', a space, the misspelled word, a space, the
number of near misses, the number of characters between the beginning of
the line and the beginning of the misspelled word, a colon, another
space, and a list of the near misses separated by commas and spaces.
Following the near misses (and identified only by the count of near
misses), if the word could be formed by adding (invalid) affixes to a
known root, is a list of suggested derivations, again separated by
commas and spaces. If there are no near misses at all, the line format
is the same, except that the '&amp;' is replaced by '?' (and the
near-miss count is always zero). The suggested derivations following the
near misses are in the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[prefix+] root [-prefix] [-suffix] [+suffix]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(e.g., "re+fry-y+ies" to get "refries") where each optional
<em>pfx</em> and <em>sfx</em> is a string. Also, each near miss or guess
is capitalized the same as the input word unless such capitalization is
invalid; in the latter case each near miss is capitalized correctly
according to the dictionary.</p>
<p>Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and there are
no near misses, then the line contains a '#', a space, the misspelled
word, a space, and the character offset from the beginning of the line.
Each sentence of text input is terminated with an additional blank line,
indicating that <em>ispell</em> has completed processing the input
line.</p>
<p>These output lines can be summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>OK:</dt>
<dd>
<p>*</p>
</dd>
<dt>Root:</dt>
<dd>
<p>+ &lt;root&gt;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Compound:</dt>
<dd>
<p>-</p>
</dd>
<dt>Miss:</dt>
<dd>
<p>&amp; &lt;original&gt; &lt;count&gt; &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;miss&gt;,
&lt;miss&gt;, ..., &lt;guess&gt;, ...</p>
</dd>
<dt>Guess:</dt>
<dd>
<p>? &lt;original&gt; 0 &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;guess&gt;, &lt;guess&gt;,
...</p>
</dd>
<dt>None:</dt>
<dd>
<p># &lt;original&gt; &lt;offset&gt;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, a dummy dictionary containing the words "fray", "Frey",
"fry", and "refried" might produce the following response to the command
"echo 'frqy refries' | ispell -a -m -d ./test.hash":</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(#) International Ispell Version 3.0.05 (beta), 08/10/91
&amp; frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry
&amp; refries 1 5: refried, re+fry-y+ies</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This mode is also suitable for interactive use when you want to
figure out the spelling of a single word.</p>
<p>The <strong>-A</strong> option works just like <strong>-a</strong>,
except that if a line begins with the string "&amp;Include_File&amp;",
the rest of the line is taken as the name of a file to read for further
words. Input returns to the original file when the include file is
exhausted. Inclusion may be nested up to five deep. The key string may
be changed with the environment variable <strong>INCLUDE_STRING</strong>
(the ampersands, if any, must be included).</p>
<p>When in the <strong>-a</strong> mode, <em>ispell</em> will also
accept lines of single words prefixed with any of '*', '&amp;', '@',
'+', '-', '~', '#', '!', '%', '`', or '^'. A line starting with '*'
tells <em>ispell</em> to insert the word into the user's dictionary
(similar to the I command). A line starting with '&amp;' tells
<em>ispell</em> to insert an all-lowercase version of the word into the
user's dictionary (similar to the U command). A line starting with '@'
causes <em>ispell</em> to accept this word in the future (similar to the
A command). A line starting with '+', followed immediately by
<strong>tex</strong> or <strong>nroff</strong> will cause
<em>ispell</em> to parse future input according the syntax of that
formatter. A line consisting solely of a '+' will place <em>ispell</em>
in TeX/LaTeX mode (similar to the <strong>-t</strong> option) and '-'
returns <em>ispell</em> to nroff/troff mode (but these commands are
obsolete). However, the string character type is <em>not</em> changed;
the '~' command must be used to do this. A line starting with '~' causes
<em>ispell</em> to set internal parameters (in particular, the default
string character type) based on the filename given in the rest of the
line. (A file suffix is sufficient, but the period must be included.
Instead of a file name or suffix, a unique name, as listed in the
language affix file, may be specified.) However, the formatter parsing
is <em>not</em> changed; the '+' command must be used to change the
formatter. A line prefixed with '#' will cause the personal dictionary
to be saved. A line prefixed with '!' will turn on <em>terse</em> mode
(see below), and a line prefixed with '%' will return <em>ispell</em> to
normal (non-terse) mode. A line prefixed with '`' will turn on
verbose-correction mode (see below); this mode can only be disabled by
turning on terse mode with '%'.</p>
<p>Any input following the prefix characters '+', '-', '#', '!', '%', or
'`' is ignored, as is any input following the filename on a '~' line. To
allow spell-checking of lines beginning with these characters, a line
starting with '^' has that character removed before it is passed to the
spell-checking code. It is recommended that programmatic interfaces
prefix every data line with an uparrow to protect themselves against
future changes in <em>ispell</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>terse</em> mode, <em>ispell</em> will not print lines
beginning with '*', '+', or '-', all of which indicate correct words.
This significantly improves running speed when the driving program is
going to ignore correct words anyway.</p>
<p>In <em>verbose-correction</em> mode, <em>ispell</em> includes the
original word immediately after the indicator character in output lines
beginning with '*', '+', and '-', which simplifies interaction for some
programs.</p>
<p>The <strong>-s</strong> option is only valid in conjunction with the
<strong>-a</strong> or <strong>-A</strong> options, and only on
BSD-derived systems. If specified, <em>ispell</em> will stop itself with
a <strong>SIGTSTP</strong> signal after each line of input. It will not
read more input until it receives a <strong>SIGCONT</strong> signal.
This may be useful for handshaking with certain text editors.</p>
<p>The <strong>-f</strong> option is only valid in conjunction with the
<strong>-a</strong> or <strong>-A</strong> options. If
<strong>-f</strong> is specified, <em>ispell</em> will write its results
to the given file, rather than to standard output.</p>
<p>The <strong>-v</strong> option causes <em>ispell</em> to print its
current version identification on the standard output and exit. If the
switch is doubled, <em>ispell</em> will also print the options that it
was compiled with.</p>
<p>The <strong>-c</strong>, <strong>-e</strong>[<strong>1\n5</strong>],
and <strong>-D</strong> options of <em>ispell</em>, are primarily
intended for use by the <em>munchlist</em> shell script. The
<strong>-c</strong> switch causes a list of words to be read from the
standard input. For each word, a list of possible root words and affixes
will be written to the standard output. Some of the root words will be
invalid and must be filtered from the output by other means; the
<em>munchlist</em> script does this. As an example, the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>echo BOTHER | ispell -c</p>
</blockquote>
<p>produces:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>BOTHER BOTHE/R BOTH/R</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-e</strong> switch is the reverse of <strong>-c</strong>;
it expands affix flags to produce a list of words. For example, the
command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>echo BOTH/R | ispell -e</p>
</blockquote>
<p>produces:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>BOTH BOTHER</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>An optional expansion level can also be specified. A level of 1
(<strong>-e1</strong>) is the same as <strong>-e</strong> alone. A level
of 2 causes the original root/affix combination to be prepended to the
line:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>BOTH/R BOTH BOTHER</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A level of 3 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each
generated word, with the original root/affix combination followed by the
word it creates:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>BOTH/R BOTH
BOTH/R BOTHER</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A level of 4 causes a floating-point number to be appended to each of
the level-3 lines, giving the ratio between the length of the root and
the total length of all generated words including the root:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>BOTH/R BOTH 2.500000
BOTH/R BOTHER 2.500000</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A level of 5 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each
generated word. If the generated word did not use any affixes, the line
is just that word. If one or more affixes were used, the original root
and the affixes actually used are printed, joined by a plus sign; then
the generated word is printed:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>BOTH
BOTH+R BOTHER</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the <strong>-D</strong> flag causes the affix tables from
the dictionary file to be dumped to standard output.</p>
<p><em>Ispell</em> is aware of the correct capitalizations of words in
the dictionary and in your personal dictionary. As well as recognizing
words that must be capitalized (e.g., George) and words that must be
all-capitals (e.g., NASA), it can also handle words with "unusual"
capitalization (e.g., "ITCorp" or "TeX"). If a word is capitalized
incorrectly, the list of possibilities will include all acceptable
capitalizations. (More than one capitalization may be acceptable; for
example, my dictionary lists both "ITCorp" and "ITcorp".)</p>
<p>Normally, this feature will not cause you surprises, but there is one
circumstance you need to be aware of. If you use "I" to add a word to
your dictionary that is at the beginning of a sentence (e.g., the first
word of this paragraph if "normally" were not in the dictionary), it
will be marked as "capitalization required". A subsequent usage of this
word without capitalization (e.g., the quoted word in the previous
sentence) will be considered a misspelling by <em>ispell</em>, and it
will suggest the capitalized version. You must then compare the actual
spellings by eye, and then type "I" to add the uncapitalized variant to
your personal dictionary. You can avoid this problem by using "U" to add
the original word, rather than "I".</p>
<p>The rules for capitalization are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Any word may appear in all capitals, as in headings.</p></li>
<li><p>Any word that is in the dictionary in all-lowercase form may
appear either in lowercase or capitalized (as at the beginning of a
sentence).</p></li>
<li><p>Any word that has "funny" capitalization (i.e., it contains both
cases and there is an uppercase character besides the first) must appear
exactly as in the dictionary, except as permitted by rule (1). If the
word is acceptable in all-lowercase, it must appear thus in a dictionary
entry.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>buildhash</h2>
<p>The <em>buildhash</em> program builds hashed dictionary files for
later use by <em>ispell.</em> The raw word list (with affix flags) is
given in <em>dict-file</em>, and the affix flags are defined by
<em>affix-file</em>. The hashed output is written to <em>hash-file</em>.
The formats of the two input files are described in <em>ispell</em>(5).
The <strong>-s</strong> (silent) option suppresses the usual status
messages that are written to the standard error device.</p>
<h2>munchlist</h2>
<p>The <em>munchlist</em> shell script is used to reduce the size of
dictionary files, primarily personal dictionary files. It is also
capable of combining dictionaries from various sources. The given
<em>files</em> are read (standard input if no arguments are given),
reduced to a minimal set of roots and affixes that will match the same
list of words, and written to standard output.</p>
<p>Input for munchlist contains of raw words (e.g from your personal
dictionary files) or root and affix combinations (probably generated in
earlier munchlist runs). Each word or root/affix combination must be on
a separate line.</p>
<p>The <strong>-D</strong> (debug) option leaves temporary files around
under standard names instead of deleting them, so that the script can be
debugged. Warning: on a multiuser system, this can be a security hole.
To avoid possible destruction of important files, don't run the script
as root, and set MUNCHDEBUGDIR to the name of a directory that only you
can access.</p>
<p>The <strong>-v</strong> (verbose) option causes progress messages to
be reported to stderr so you won't get nervous that <em>munchlist</em>
has hung.</p>
<p>If the <strong>-s</strong> (strip) option is specified, words that
are in the specified <em>hash-file</em> are removed from the word list.
This can be useful with personal dictionaries.</p>
<p>The <strong>-l</strong> option can be used to specify an alternate
<em>affix-file</em> for munching dictionaries in languages other than
English.</p>
<p>The <strong>-c</strong> option can be used to convert dictionaries
that were built with an older affix file, without risk of accidentally
introducing unintended affix combinations into the dictionary.</p>
<p>The <strong>-T</strong> option allows dictionaries to be converted to
a canonical string-character format. The suffix specified is looked up
in the affix file (<strong>-l</strong> switch) to determine the
string-character format used for the input file; the output always uses
the canonical string-character format. For example, a dictionary
collected from TeX source files might be converted to canonical format
by specifying <strong>-T tex</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>-w</strong> option is passed on to <em>ispell</em>.</p>
<h2>findaffix</h2>
<p>The <em>findaffix</em> shell script is an aid to writers of new
language descriptions in choosing affixes. The given dictionary
<em>files</em> (standard input if none are given) are examined for
possible prefixes (<strong>-p</strong> switch) or suffixes
(<strong>-s</strong> switch, the default). Each commonly-occurring affix
is presented along with a count of the number of times it appears and an
estimate of the number of bytes that would be saved in a dictionary hash
file if it were added to the language table. Only affixes that generate
valid roots (found in the original input) are listed.</p>
<p>If the "-c" option is not given, the output lines are in the
following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>strip/add/count/bytes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>strip</em> is the string that should be stripped from a
root word before adding the affix, <em>add</em> is the affix to be
added, <em>count</em> is a count of the number of times that this
<em>strip</em>/<em>add</em> combination appears, and <em>bytes</em> is
an estimate of the number of bytes that might be saved in the raw
dictionary file if this combination is added to the affix file. The
field separator in the output will be the tab character specified by the
<strong>-t</strong> switch; the default is a slash ("/").</p>
<p>If the <strong>-c</strong> ("clean output") option is given, the
appearance of the output is made visually cleaner (but harder to
post-process) by changing it to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-strip+add&lt;tab&gt;count&lt;tab&gt;bytes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>strip</em>, <em>add</em>, <em>count</em>, and
<em>bytes</em> are as before, and <em>&lt;tab&gt;</em> represents the
ASCII tab character.</p>
<p>The method used to generate possible affixes will also generate
longer affixes which have common headers or trailers. For example, the
two words "moth" and "mother" will generate not only the obvious
substitution "+er" but also "-h+her" and "-th+ther" (and possibly even
longer ones, depending on the value of <em>min</em>). To prevent
cluttering the output with such affixes, any affix pair that shares a
common header (or, for prefixes, trailer) string longer than
<em>elim</em> characters (default 1) will be suppressed. You may want to
set "elim" to a value greater than 1 if your language has string
characters; usually the need for this parameter will become obvious when
you examine the output of your <em>findaffix</em> run.</p>
<p>Normally, the affixes are sorted according to the estimate of bytes
saved. The <strong>-f</strong> switch may be used to cause the affixes
to be sorted by frequency of appearance.</p>
<p>To save output file space, affixes which occur fewer than 10 times
are eliminated; this limit may be changed with the <strong>-l</strong>
switch. The <strong>-M</strong> switch specifies a maximum affix length
(default 8). Affixes longer than this will not be reported. (This saves
on temporary disk space and makes the script run faster.)</p>
<p>Affixes which generate stems shorter than 3 characters are
suppressed. (A stem is the word after the <em>strip</em> string has been
removed, and before the <em>add</em> string has been added.) This
reduces both the running time and the size of the output file. This
limit may be changed with the <strong>-m</strong> switch. The minimum
stem length should only be set to 1 if you have a <em>lot</em> of free
time and disk space (in the range of many days and hundreds of
megabytes).</p>
<p>The <em>findaffix</em> script requires a non-blank field-separator
character for internal use. Normally, this character is a slash ("/"),
but if the slash appears as a character in the input word list, a
different character can be specified with the <strong>-t</strong>
switch.</p>
<p>Ispell dictionaries should be expanded before being fed to
<em>findaffix</em>; in addition, characters that are not in the English
alphabet (if any) should be translated to lowercase.</p>
<h2>tryaffix</h2>
<p>The <em>tryaffix</em> shell script is used to estimate the
effectiveness of a proposed prefix (<strong>-p</strong> switch) or
suffix (<strong>-s</strong> switch, the default) with a given
<em>expanded-file</em>. Only one affix can be tried with each execution
of <em>tryaffix</em>, although multiple arguments can be used to
describe varying forms of the same affix flag (e.g., the
<strong>D</strong> flag for English can add either <em>D</em> or
<em>ED</em> depending on whether a trailing E is already present). Each
word in the expanded dictionary that ends (or begins) with the chosen
suffix (or prefix) has that suffix (prefix) removed; the dictionary is
then searched for root words that match the stripped word. Normally, all
matching roots are written to standard output, but if the
<strong>-c</strong> (count) flag is given, only a statistical summary of
the results is written. The statistics given are a count of words the
affix potentially applies to and an estimate of the number of dictionary
bytes that a flag using the affix would save. The estimate will be high
if the flag generates words that are currently generated by other affix
flags (e.g., in English, <em>bathers</em> can be generated by either
<em>bath/X</em> or <em>bather/S</em>).</p>
<p>The dictionary file, <em>expanded-file</em>, must already be expanded
(using the <strong>-e</strong> switch of <em>ispell</em>) and sorted,
and things will usually work best if uppercase has been folded to lower
with 'tr'.</p>
<p>The <em>affix</em> arguments are things to be stripped from the
dictionary file to produce trial roots: for English, <em>con</em>
(prefix) and <em>ing</em> (suffix) are examples. The <em>addition</em>
parts of the argument are letters that would have been stripped off the
root before adding the affix. For example, in English the affix
<em>ing</em> normally strips <em>e</em> for words ending in that letter
(e.g., <em>like</em> becomes <em>liking</em>) so we might run:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>tryaffix ing ing+e</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>to cover both cases.</p>
<p>All of the shell scripts contain documentation as commentary at the
beginning; sometimes these comments contain useful information beyond
the scope of this manual page.</p>
<p>It is possible to install <em>ispell</em> in such a way as to only
support ASCII range text if desired.</p>
<h2>icombine</h2>
<p>The <em>icombine</em> program is a helper for <em>munchlist</em>. It
reads a list of words in dictionary format (roots plus flags) from the
standard input, and produces a reduced list on standard output which
combines common roots found on adjacent entries. Identical roots which
have differing flags will have their flags combined, and roots which
have differing capitalizations will be combined in a way which only
preserves important capitalization information. The optional
<em>aff-file</em> specifies a language file which defines the character
sets used and the meanings of the various flags. The <strong>-T</strong>
switch can be used to select among alternative string character types by
giving a dummy suffix that can be found in an
<strong>altstringtype</strong> statement. The <strong>-w</strong> switch
is identical to the same switch in <em>ispell</em>.</p>
<h2>ijoin</h2>
<p>The <em>ijoin</em> program is a re-implementation of <em>join</em>(1)
which handles long lines and 8-bit characters correctly. The
<strong>-s</strong> switch specifies that the <em>sort</em>(1) program
used to prepare the input to <em>ijoin</em> uses signed comparisons on
8-bit characters; the <strong>-u</strong> switch specifies that
<em>sort</em>(1) uses unsigned comparisons. All other options and
behaviors of <em>join</em>(1) are duplicated as exactly as possible
based on the manual page, except that <em>ijoin</em> will not handle
newline as a field separator. See the <em>join</em>(1) manual page for
more information.</p>

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p><em>Ispell</em> should understand more <em>troff</em> syntax, and
deal more intelligently with contractions.</p>
<p>Although small personal dictionaries are sorted before they are
written out, the order of capitalizations of the same word is somewhat
random.</p>
<p>When the <strong>-x</strong> flag is specified, <em>ispell</em> will
unlink any existing .bak file.</p>
<p>There are too many flags, and many of them have non-mnemonic
names.</p>
<p>The <strong>-e</strong> flag should accept mnemonic arguments instead
of numeric ones.</p>
<p><em>Munchlist</em> does not deal very gracefully with dictionaries
which contain "non-word" characters. Such characters ought to be deleted
from the dictionary with a warning message.</p>
