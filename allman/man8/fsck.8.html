<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>fsck - check and repair a Linux filesystem</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>fsck</strong> [<strong>-lsAVRTMNP</strong>]
[<strong>-r</strong> [<em>fd</em>]] [<strong>-C</strong> [<em>fd</em>]]
[<strong>-t</strong> <em>fstype</em>] [<em>filesystem</em>...]
[<strong>--</strong>] [<em>fs-specific-options</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>fsck</strong> is used to check and optionally repair one or
more Linux filesystems. <em>filesystem</em> can be a device name (e.g.,
<em>/dev/hdc1</em>, <em>/dev/sdb2</em>), a mount point (e.g.,
<em>/</em>, <em>/usr</em>, <em>/home</em>), or an filesystem label or
UUID specifier (e.g., UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or
LABEL=root). Normally, the <strong>fsck</strong> program will try to
handle filesystems on different physical disk drives in parallel to
reduce the total amount of time needed to check all of them.</p>
<p>If no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the
<strong>-A</strong> option is not specified, <strong>fsck</strong> will
default to checking filesystems in <em>/etc/fstab</em> serially. This is
equivalent to the <strong>-As</strong> options.</p>
<p>The exit status returned by <strong>fsck</strong> is the sum of the
following conditions:</p>
<p><strong>0</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No errors</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filesystem errors corrected</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>System should be rebooted</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filesystem errors left uncorrected</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operational error</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>16</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usage or syntax error</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>32</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Checking canceled by user request</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>128</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shared-library error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exit status returned when multiple filesystems are checked is the
bit-wise OR of the exit statuses for each filesystem that is
checked.</p>
<p>In actuality, <strong>fsck</strong> is simply a front-end for the
various filesystem checkers (<strong>fsck</strong>.<em>fstype</em>)
available under Linux. The filesystem-specific checker is searched for
in the <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable. If the
<strong>PATH</strong> is undefined then fallback to <em>/sbin</em>.</p>
<p>Please see the filesystem-specific checker manual pages for further
details.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-l</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an exclusive <strong>flock</strong>(2) lock file
(<em>/run/fsck/&lt;diskname&gt;.lock</em>) for whole-disk device. This
option can be used with one device only (this means that
<strong>-A</strong> and <strong>-l</strong> are mutually exclusive).
This option is recommended when more <strong>fsck</strong> instances are
executed in the same time. The option is ignored when used for multiple
devices or for non-rotating disks. <strong>fsck</strong> does not lock
underlying devices when executed to check stacked devices (e.g. MD or
DM) - this feature is not implemented yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-r</strong> [<em>fd</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Report certain statistics for each fsck when it completes. These
statistics include the exit status, the maximum run set size (in
kilobytes), the elapsed all-clock time and the user and system CPU time
used by the fsck run. For example:</p>
<p><strong>/dev/sda1: status 0, rss 92828, real 4.002804, user 2.677592,
sys 0.86186</strong></p>
<p>GUI front-ends may specify a file descriptor <em>fd</em>, in which
case the progress bar information will be sent to that file descriptor
in a machine parsable format. For example:</p>
<p><strong>/dev/sda1 0 92828 4.002804 2.677592 0.86186</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-s</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serialize <strong>fsck</strong> operations. This is a good idea if
you are checking multiple filesystems and the checkers are in an
interactive mode. (Note: <strong>e2fsck</strong>(8) runs in an
interactive mode by default. To make <strong>e2fsck</strong>(8) run in a
non-interactive mode, you must either specify the <strong>-p</strong> or
<strong>-a</strong> option, if you wish for errors to be corrected
automatically, or the <strong>-n</strong> option if you do not.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-t</strong> <em>fslist</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the type(s) of filesystem to be checked. When the
<strong>-A</strong> flag is specified, only filesystems that match
<em>fslist</em> are checked. The <em>fslist</em> parameter is a
comma-separated list of filesystems and options specifiers. All of the
filesystems in this comma-separated list may be prefixed by a negation
operator '<strong>no</strong>' or '<strong>!</strong>', which requests
that only those filesystems not listed in <em>fslist</em> will be
checked. If none of the filesystems in <em>fslist</em> is prefixed by a
negation operator, then only those listed filesystems will be
checked.</p>
<p>Options specifiers may be included in the comma-separated
<em>fslist</em>. They must have the format
<strong>opts=</strong><em>fs-option</em>. If an options specifier is
present, then only filesystems which contain <em>fs-option</em> in their
mount options field of <em>/etc/fstab</em> will be checked. If the
options specifier is prefixed by a negation operator, then only those
filesystems that do not have <em>fs-option</em> in their mount options
field of <em>/etc/fstab</em> will be checked.</p>
<p>For example, if <strong>opts=ro</strong> appears in <em>fslist</em>,
then only filesystems listed in <em>/etc/fstab</em> with the
<strong>ro</strong> option will be checked.</p>
<p>For compatibility with Mandrake distributions whose boot scripts
depend upon an unauthorized UI change to the <strong>fsck</strong>
program, if a filesystem type of <strong>loop</strong> is found in
<em>fslist</em>, it is treated as if <strong>opts=loop</strong> were
specified as an argument to the <strong>-t</strong> option.</p>
<p>Normally, the filesystem type is deduced by searching for
<em>filesys</em> in the <em>/etc/fstab</em> file and using the
corresponding entry. If the type cannot be deduced, and there is only a
single filesystem given as an argument to the <strong>-t</strong>
option, <strong>fsck</strong> will use the specified filesystem type. If
this type is not available, then the default filesystem type (currently
ext2) is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-A</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walk through the <em>/etc/fstab</em> file and try to check all
filesystems in one run. This option is typically used from the
<em>/etc/rc</em> system initialization file, instead of multiple
commands for checking a single filesystem.</p>
<p>The root filesystem will be checked first unless the
<strong>-P</strong> option is specified (see below). After that,
filesystems will be checked in the order specified by the
<em>fs_passno</em> (the sixth) field in the <em>/etc/fstab</em> file.
Filesystems with a <em>fs_passno</em> value of 0 are skipped and are not
checked at all. Filesystems with a <em>fs_passno</em> value of greater
than zero will be checked in order, with filesystems with the lowest
<em>fs_passno</em> number being checked first. If there are multiple
filesystems with the same pass number, <strong>fsck</strong> will
attempt to check them in parallel, although it will avoid running
multiple filesystem checks on the same physical disk.</p>
<p><strong>fsck</strong> does not check stacked devices (RAIDs,
dm-crypt, ...) in parallel with any other device. See below for
<strong>FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL</strong> setting. The <em>/sys</em>
filesystem is used to determine dependencies between devices.</p>
<p>Hence, a very common configuration in <em>/etc/fstab</em> files is to
set the root filesystem to have a <em>fs_passno</em> value of 1 and to
set all other filesystems to have a <em>fs_passno</em> value of 2. This
will allow <strong>fsck</strong> to automatically run filesystem
checkers in parallel if it is advantageous to do so. System
administrators might choose not to use this configuration if they need
to avoid multiple filesystem checks running in parallel for some reason
- for example, if the machine in question is short on memory so that
excessive paging is a concern.</p>
<p><strong>fsck</strong> normally does not check whether the device
actually exists before calling a filesystem specific checker. Therefore
non-existing devices may cause the system to enter filesystem repair
mode during boot if the filesystem specific checker returns a fatal
error. The <em>/etc/fstab</em> mount option <strong>nofail</strong> may
be used to have <strong>fsck</strong> skip non-existing devices.
<strong>fsck</strong> also skips non-existing devices that have the
special filesystem type <strong>auto</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-C</strong> [<em>fd</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display completion/progress bars for those filesystem checkers
(currently only for ext[234]) which support them. <strong>fsck</strong>
will manage the filesystem checkers so that only one of them will
display a progress bar at a time. GUI front-ends may specify a file
descriptor <em>fd</em>, in which case the progress bar information will
be sent to that file descriptor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-M</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not check mounted filesystems and return an exit status of 0 for
mounted filesystems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-N</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donâ€™t execute, just show what would be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-P</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the <strong>-A</strong> flag is set, check the root filesystem
in parallel with the other filesystems. This is not the safest thing in
the world to do, since if the root filesystem is in doubt things like
the <strong>e2fsck</strong>(8) executable might be corrupted! This
option is mainly provided for those sysadmins who donâ€™t want to
repartition the root filesystem to be small and compact (which is really
the right solution).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-R</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When checking all filesystems with the <strong>-A</strong> flag, skip
the root filesystem. (This is useful in case the root filesystem has
already been mounted read-write.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-T</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donâ€™t show the title on startup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-V</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Produce verbose output, including all filesystem-specific commands
that are executed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-?</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display version information and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>Options which are not understood by fsck are passed to the
filesystem-specific checker!</strong></p>
<p>These options <strong>must</strong> not take arguments, as there is
no way for <strong>fsck</strong> to be able to properly guess which
options take arguments and which donâ€™t.</p>
<p>Options and arguments which follow the <strong>--</strong> are
treated as filesystem-specific options to be passed to the
filesystem-specific checker.</p>
<p>Please note that <strong>fsck</strong> is not designed to pass
arbitrarily complicated options to filesystem-specific checkers. If
youâ€™re doing something complicated, please just execute the
filesystem-specific checker directly. If you pass <strong>fsck</strong>
some horribly complicated options and arguments, and it doesnâ€™t do what
you expect, <strong>donâ€™t bother reporting it as a bug.</strong> Youâ€™re
almost certainly doing something that you shouldnâ€™t be doing with
<strong>fsck</strong>. Options to different filesystem-specific fsckâ€™s
are not standardized.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>The <strong>fsck</strong> programâ€™s behavior is affected by the
following environment variables:</p>
<p><strong>FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>fsck</strong> will
attempt to check all of the specified filesystems in parallel,
regardless of whether the filesystems appear to be on the same device.
(This is useful for RAID systems or high-end storage systems such as
those sold by companies such as IBM or EMC.) Note that the
<em>fs_passno</em> value is still used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FSCK_MAX_INST</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This environment variable will limit the maximum number of filesystem
checkers that can be running at one time. This allows configurations
which have a large number of disks to avoid <strong>fsck</strong>
starting too many filesystem checkers at once, which might overload CPU
and memory resources available on the system. If this value is zero,
then an unlimited number of processes can be spawned. This is currently
the default, but future versions of <strong>fsck</strong> may attempt to
automatically determine how many filesystem checks can be run based on
gathering accounting data from the operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PATH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable is used to find
filesystem checkers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FSTAB_FILE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This environment variable allows the system administrator to override
the standard location of the <em>/etc/fstab</em> file. It is also useful
for developers who are testing <strong>fsck</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LIBBLKID_DEBUG=all</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>enables libblkid debug output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LIBMOUNT_DEBUG=all</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>enables libmount debug output.</p>
