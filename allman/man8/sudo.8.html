policy. The invoking user's real</p>
<p>user-ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the
security policy.</p>
<p>supports a plugin architecture for security policies, auditing, and
input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own
plugins to work seamlessly with the</p>
<p>front-end. The default security policy is</p>
<p>which is configured via the file</p>
<p>or via LDAP. See the</p>
<p>section for more information.</p>
<p>The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to
run</p>
<p>The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a
password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is
required,</p>
<p>will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable
time limit. This limit is policy-specific; the default password prompt
timeout for the</p>
<p>security policy is 0 minutes.</p>
<p>Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to
run</p>
<p>again for a period of time without requiring authentication. By
default, the</p>
<p>policy caches credentials on a per-terminal basis for 15 minutes. See
the</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>options in</p>
<p>for more information. By running</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>option, a user can update the cached credentials without running
a</p>
<p>On systems where</p>
<p>is the primary method of gaining superuser privileges, it is
imperative to avoid syntax errors in the security policy configuration
files. For the default security policy,</p>
<p>changes to the configuration files should be made using the</p>
<p>utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are introduced.</p>
<p>When invoked as</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>option (described below), is implied.</p>
<p>Security policies and audit plugins may log successful and failed
attempts to run</p>
<p>If an I/O plugin is configured, the running</p>
<p>input and output may be logged as well.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>Normally, if</p>
<p>requires a password, it will read it from the user's terminal. If
the</p>
<p>option is specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is
executed to read the user's password and output the password to the
standard output. If the</p>
<p>environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the helper
program. Otherwise, if</p>
<p>contains a line specifying the askpass program, that value will be
used. For example:</p>
<p># Path to askpass helper program Path askpass
/usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass</p>
<p>If no askpass program is available,</p>
<p>will exit with an error.</p>
<p>Ring the bell as part of the password prompt when a terminal is
present. This option has no effect if an askpass program is used.</p>

manipulate background processes started by</p>

standard output, and standard error when executing a</p>
<p>The security policy may restrict the user's ability to use this
option. The</p>
<p>policy only permits use of the</p>
<p>option when the administrator has enabled the</p>
<p>option.</p>
<p>Run the</p>
<p>in the specified</p>
<p>instead of the current working directory. The security policy may
return an error if the user does not have permission to specify the
working directory.</p>
<p>Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve
their existing environment variables. The security policy may return an
error if the user does not have permission to preserve the
environment.</p>
<p>Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to add the
comma-separated list of environment variables to those preserved from
the user's environment. The security policy may return an error if the
user does not have permission to preserve the environment. This option
may be specified multiple times.</p>
<p>Edit one or more</p>
<p>instead of running a</p>
<p>In lieu of a path name, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting
the security policy. If the user is authorized by the policy, the
following steps are taken:</p>
<p>Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner
set to the invoking user.</p>
<p>The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the temporary
files. The</p>
<p>policy uses the</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>environment variables (in that order). If none of</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>are set, the first program listed in the</p>
<p>option is used.</p>
<p>If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to
their original location and the temporary versions are removed.</p>
<p>To help prevent the editing of unauthorized files, the following
restrictions are enforced unless explicitly allowed by the security
policy:</p>
<p>Symbolic links may not be edited (version 1.8.15 and higher).</p>
<p>Symbolic links along the path to be edited are not followed when the
parent directory is writable by the invoking user unless that user is
root (version 1.8.16 and higher).</p>
<p>Files located in a directory that is writable by the invoking user
may not be edited unless that user is root (version 1.8.16 and
higher).</p>
<p>Users are never allowed to edit device special files.</p>
<p>If the specified file does not exist, it will be created. Unlike
most</p>
<p>run by</p>
<p>the editor is run with the invoking user's environment unmodified. If
the temporary file becomes empty after editing, the user will be
prompted before it is installed. If, for some reason,</p>
<p>is unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will
receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary
file.</p>
<p>Run the</p>
<p>with the primary group set to</p>

database entry. The</p>
<p>may be either a group name or a numeric group-ID</p>
<p>prefixed with the</p>
<p>character (e.g.,</p>
<p>for GID 0). When running a</p>
<p>as a GID, many shells require that the</p>
<p>be escaped with a backslash</p>
<p>If no</p>
<p>option is specified, the</p>
<p>will be run as the invoking user. In either case, the primary group
will be set to</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>policy permits any of the target user's groups to be specified via
the</p>
<p>option as long as the</p>
<p>option is not in use.</p>
<p>Request that the security policy set the</p>
<p>environment variable to the home directory specified by the target
user's password database entry. Depending on the policy, this may be the
default behavior.</p>
<p>Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.</p>
<p>Run the</p>

<p>option to list a user's privileges for the remote host.</p>
<p>Run the shell specified by the target user's password database entry
as a login shell. This means that login-specific resource files such

<p>is specified, an interactive shell is executed.</p>
<p>attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the
shell. The</p>
<p>is run with an environment similar to the one a user would receive at
log in. Most shells behave differently when a</p>

shell's manual for details. The</p>
<p>section in the</p>
<p>manual documents how the</p>
<p>option affects the environment in which a</p>
<p>is run when the</p>
<p>policy is in use.</p>
<p>Similar to the</p>
<p>option, except that it removes every cached credential for the user,
regardless of the terminal or parent process ID. The next time</p>
<p>is run, a password must be entered if the security policy requires
authentication. It is not possible to use the</p>
<p>option in conjunction with a</p>
<p>or other option. This option does not require a password. Not all
security policies support credential caching.</p>
<p>When used without a</p>
<p>invalidates the user's cached credentials for the current session.
The next time</p>
<p>is run in the session, a password must be entered if the security
policy requires authentication. By default, the</p>
<p>policy uses a separate record in the credential cache for each
terminal (or parent process ID if no terminal is present). This prevents
the</p>
<p>option from interfering with</p>
<p>commands run in a different terminal session. See the</p>
<p>option in</p>
<p>for more information. This option does not require a password, and
was added to allow a user to revoke</p>
<p>permissions from a</p>
<p>file.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with a</p>
<p>or an option that may require a password, this option will cause</p>
<p>to ignore the user's cached credentials. As a result,</p>
<p>will prompt for a password (if one is required by the security
policy) and will not update the user's cached credentials.</p>
<p>Not all security policies support credential caching.</p>
<p>If no</p>
<p>is specified, list the privileges for the invoking user (or the</p>
<p>specified by the</p>
<p>option) on the current host. A longer list format is used if this
option is specified multiple times and the security policy supports a
verbose output format.</p>
<p>If a</p>
<p>is specified and is permitted by the security policy, the
fully-qualified path to the</p>
<p>is displayed along with any</p>
<p>If a</p>
<p>is specified but not allowed by the policy,</p>
<p>will exit with a status value of 1.</p>
<p>Do not update the user's cached credentials, even if the user
successfully authenticates. Unlike the</p>
<p>flag, existing cached credentials are used if they are valid. To
detect when the user's cached credentials are valid (or when no
authentication is required), the following can be used:</p>
<p>Not all security policies support credential caching.</p>
<p>Avoid prompting the user for input of any kind. If a password is
required for the</p>
<p>to run,</p>
<p>will display an error message and exit.</p>
<p>Preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered. By default,
the</p>
<p>policy will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the
target user is a member of. The real and effective group-IDs, however,
are still set to match the target user.</p>
<p>Use a custom password prompt with optional escape sequences. The
following percent</p>
<p>escape sequences are supported by the</p>
<p>policy:</p>
<p>expanded to the host name including the domain name (only if the
machine's host name is fully qualified or the</p>
<p>option is set in</p>
<p>expanded to the local host name without the domain name</p>

(respects the</p>
<p>and</p>

<p>option is also specified)</p>
<p>expanded to the invoking user's login name</p>
<p>two consecutive</p>
<p>characters are collapsed into a single</p>
<p>character</p>
<p>The custom prompt will override the default prompt specified by
either the security policy or the</p>
<p>environment variable. On systems that use PAM, the custom prompt will
also override the prompt specified by a PAM module unless the</p>
<p>flag is disabled in</p>
<p>Change to the specified root</p>

<p>before running the</p>
<p>The security policy may return an error if the user does not have
permission to specify the root directory.</p>
<p>Write the prompt to the standard error and read the password from the
standard input instead of using the terminal device.</p>
<p>Run the shell specified by the</p>
<p>environment variable if it is set or the shell specified by the
invoking user's password database entry. If a</p>
<p>is specified, it is passed to the shell as a simple command using

shell's manual for details.</p>
<p>Used in conjunction with the</p>
<p>option to list the privileges for</p>

listing other users' privileges. When using the</p>
<p>policy, the</p>
<p>option is restricted to the root user and users with either the</p>
<p>priviege for the specified</p>
<p>or the ability to run any</p>

<p>Used to set a timeout for the</p>

enabled.</p>

<p>Some security policies may restrict UIDs to those listed in the

match those of the target user, as specified in the password database,

<p>There are two distinct ways</p>
<p>can run a</p>
<p>If an I/O logging plugin is configured to log terminal I/O, or if the
security policy explicitly requests it, a new pseudo-terminal</p>
<p>is allocated and</p>
<p>is used to create a second</p>
<p>process, referred to as the</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>creates a new terminal session with itself as the leader and the pty
as its controlling terminal, calls</p>
<p>again, sets up the execution environment as described above, and then
uses the</p>
<p>system call to run the</p>
<p>in the child process. The</p>
<p>exists to relay job control signals between the user's terminal and
the pty the</p>
<p>is being run in. This makes it possible to suspend and resume the</p>
<p>normally. Without the</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>would be in what POSIX terms an</p>

When the</p>
<p>exits or is terminated by a signal, the</p>
<p>passes the</p>
<p>exit status to the main</p>
<p>process and exits. After receiving the</p>
<p>exit status, the main</p>
<p>process passes the</p>
<p>exit status to the security policy's close function, as well as the
close function of any configured audit plugin, and exits.</p>
<p>If no pty is used,</p>
<p>calls</p>
<p>sets up the execution environment as described above, and uses
the</p>
<p>system call to run the</p>
<p>in the child process. The main</p>
<p>process waits until the</p>
<p>has completed, then passes the</p>
<p>exit status to the security policy's close function, as well as the
close function of any configured audit plugins, and exits. As a special
case, if the policy plugin does not define a close function,</p>
<p>will execute the</p>
<p>directly instead of calling</p>
<p>first. The</p>
<p>policy plugin will only define a close function when I/O logging is
enabled, a pty is required, an SELinux role is specified, the</p>
<p>has an associated timeout, or the</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>options are enabled. Both</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>are enabled by default on systems using PAM.</p>
<p>On systems that use PAM, the security policy's close function is
responsible for closing the PAM session. It may also log the</p>

<p>from relaying the</p>
<p>signal it received back to</p>

leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user mode. Note,
however, that this check only applies to the</p>
