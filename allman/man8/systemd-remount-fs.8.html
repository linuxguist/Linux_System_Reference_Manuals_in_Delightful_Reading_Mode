<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-remount-fs.service, systemd-remount-fs - Remount root and
kernel file systems</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-remount-fs.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-remount-fs</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-remount-fs.service is an early boot service that applies
mount options listed in <strong>fstab</strong>(5), or gathered from the
partition table (when <strong>systemd-gpt-auto-generator</strong>(8) is
active) to the root file system, the /usr/ file system, and the kernel
API file systems. This is required so that the mount options of these
file systems — which are pre-mounted by the kernel, the initrd,
container environments or system manager code — are updated to those
configured in /etc/fstab and the other sources. This service ignores
normal file systems and only changes the root file system (i.e. /),
/usr/, and the virtual kernel API file systems such as /proc/, /sys/ or
/dev/. This service executes no operation if no configuration is found
(/etc/fstab does not exist or lists no entries for the mentioned file
systems, or the partition table does not contain relevant entries).</p>
<p>For a longer discussion of kernel API file systems see <strong>API
File Systems</strong>[1].</p>
<p>Note: systemd-remount-fs.service is usually pulled in by
<strong>systemd-fstab-generator</strong>(8), hence it is also affected
by the kernel command line option <em>fstab=</em>, which may be used to
disable the generator. It may also pulled in by
<strong>systemd-gpt-auto-generator</strong>(8), which is affected by
<em>systemd.gpt_auto</em> and other options.</p>
