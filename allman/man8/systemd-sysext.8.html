<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-sysext, systemd-sysext.service - Activates System Extension
Images</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-sysext</strong> [OPTIONS...] COMMAND</p>
<pre><code>systemd-sysext.service</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-sysext</strong> activates/deactivates system
extension images. System extension images may – dynamically at runtime —
extend the /usr/ and /opt/ directory hierarchies with additional files.
This is particularly useful on immutable system images where a /usr/
and/or /opt/ hierarchy residing on a read-only file system shall be
extended temporarily at runtime without making any persistent
modifications.</p>
<p>System extension images should contain files and directories similar
in fashion to regular operating system tree. When one or more system
extension images are activated, their /usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies are
combined via "overlayfs" with the same hierarchies of the host OS, and
the host /usr/ and /opt/ overmounted with it ("merging"). When they are
deactivated, the mount point is disassembled — again revealing the
unmodified original host version of the hierarchy ("unmerging"). Merging
thus makes the extensions resources suddenly appear below the /usr/ and
/opt/ hierarchies as if they were included in the base OS image itself.
Unmerging makes them disappear again, leaving in place only the files
that were shipped with the base OS image itself.</p>
<p>Files and directories contained in the extension images outside of
the /usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies are <em>not</em> merged, and hence have
no effect when included in a system extension image. In particular,
files in the /etc/ and /var/ included in a system extension image will
<em>not</em> appear in the respective hierarchies after activation.</p>
<p>System extension images are strictly read-only, and the host /usr/
and /opt/ hierarchies become read-only too while they are activated.</p>
<p>System extensions are supposed to be purely additive, i.e. they are
supposed to include only files that do not exist in the underlying basic
OS image. However, the underlying mechanism (overlayfs) also allows
overlaying or removing files, but it is recommended not to make use of
this.</p>
<p>System extension images may be provided in the following formats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Plain directories or btrfs subvolumes containing the OS tree</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Disk images with a GPT disk label, following the <strong>Discoverable
Partitions Specification</strong>[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Disk images lacking a partition table, with a naked Linux file system
(e.g. squashfs or ext4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These image formats are the same ones that
<strong>systemd-nspawn</strong>(1) supports via its
<strong>--directory=</strong>/<strong>--image=</strong> switches and
those that the service manager supports via
<strong>RootDirectory=</strong>/<strong>RootImage=</strong>. Similar to
them they may optionally carry Verity authentication information.</p>
<p>System extensions are automatically looked for in the directories
/etc/extensions/, /run/extensions/, /var/lib/extensions/,
/usr/lib/extensions/ and /usr/local/lib/extensions/. The first two
listed directories are not suitable for carrying large binary images,
however are still useful for carrying symlinks to them. The primary
place for installing system extensions is /var/lib/extensions/. Any
directories found in these search directories are considered directory
based extension images, any files with the .raw suffix are considered
disk image based extension images.</p>
<p>During boot OS extension images are activated automatically, if the
systemd-sysext.service is enabled. Note that this service runs only
after the underlying file systems where system extensions may be located
have been mounted. This means they are not suitable for shipping
resources that are processed by subsystems running in earliest boot.
Specifically, OS extension images are not suitable for shipping system
services or <strong>systemd-sysusers</strong>(8) definitions. See
<strong>Portable Services</strong>[2] for a simple mechanism for
shipping system services in disk images, in a similar fashion to OS
extensions. Note the different isolation on these two mechanisms: while
system extension directly extend the underlying OS image with additional
files that appear in a way very similar to as if they were shipped in
the OS image itself and thus imply no security isolation, portable
services imply service level sandboxing in one way or another. The
systemd-sysext.service service is guaranteed to finish start-up before
basic.target is reached; i.e. at the time regular services initialize
(those which do not use <em>DefaultDependencies=no</em>), the files and
directories system extensions provide are available in /usr/ and /opt/
and may be accessed.</p>
<p>Note that there is no concept of enabling/disabling installed system
extension images: all installed extension images are automatically
activated at boot. However, you can place an empty directory named like
the extension (no .raw) in /etc/extensions/ to "mask" an extension with
the same name in a system folder with lower precedence.</p>
<p>A simple mechanism for version compatibility is enforced: a system
extension image must carry a
/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<em>$name</em> file,
which must match its image name, that is compared with the host
os-release file: the contained <em>ID=</em> fields have to match unless
"_any" is set for the extension. If the extension <em>ID=</em> is not
"_any", the <em>SYSEXT_LEVEL=</em> field (if defined) has to match. If
the latter is not defined, the <em>VERSION_ID=</em> field has to match
instead. If the extension defines the <em>ARCHITECTURE=</em> field and
the value is not "_any" it has to match the kernels architecture
reported by <strong>uname</strong>(2) but the used architecture
identifiers are the same as for <em>ConditionArchitecture=</em>
described in <strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5). System extensions should
not ship a /usr/lib/os-release file (as that would be merged into the
host /usr/ tree, overriding the host OS version data, which is not
desirable). The extension-release file follows the same format and
semantics, and carries the same content, as the os-release file of the
OS, but it describes the resources carried in the extension image.</p>
<h1>USES</h1>
<p>The primary use case for system images are immutable environments
where debugging and development tools shall optionally be made
available, but not included in the immutable base OS image itself (e.g.
<strong>strace</strong>(1) and <strong>gdb</strong>(1) shall be an
optionally installable addition in order to make debugging/development
easier). System extension images should not be misunderstood as a
generic software packaging framework, as no dependency scheme is
available: system extensions should carry all files they need
themselves, except for those already shipped in the underlying host
system image. Typically, system extension images are built at the same
time as the base OS image — within the same build system.</p>
<p>Another use case for the system extension concept is temporarily
overriding OS supplied resources with newer ones, for example to install
a locally compiled development version of some low-level component over
the immutable OS image without doing a full OS rebuild or modifying the
nominally immutable image. (e.g. "install" a locally built package with
<strong>DESTDIR=/var/lib/extensions/mytest make install &amp;&amp;
systemd-sysext refresh</strong>, making it available in /usr/ as if it
was installed in the OS image itself.) This case works regardless if the
underlying host /usr/ is managed as immutable disk image or is a
traditional package manager controlled (i.e. writable) tree.</p>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<p>The following commands are understood:</p>
<p><strong>status</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When invoked without any command verb, or when
<strong>status</strong> is specified the current merge status is shown,
separately for both /usr/ and /opt/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>merge</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Merges all currently installed system extension images into /usr/ and
/opt/, by overmounting these hierarchies with an "overlayfs" file system
combining the underlying hierarchies with those included in the
extension images. This command will fail if the hierarchies are already
merged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>unmerge</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unmerges all currently installed system extension images from /usr/
and /opt/, by unmounting the "overlayfs" file systems created by
<strong>merge</strong> prior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>refresh</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A combination of <strong>unmerge</strong> and <strong>merge</strong>:
if already mounted the existing "overlayfs" instance is unmounted
temporarily, and then replaced by a new version. This command is useful
after installing/removing system extension images, in order to update
the "overlayfs" file system accordingly. If no system extensions are
installed when this command is executed, the equivalent of
<strong>unmerge</strong> is executed, without establishing any new
"overlayfs" instance. Note that currently theres a brief moment where
neither the old nor the new "overlayfs" file system is mounted. This
implies that all resources supplied by a system extension will briefly
disappear — even if it exists continuously during the refresh
operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A brief list of installed extension images is shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>--root=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operate relative to the specified root directory, i.e. establish the
"overlayfs" mount not on the top-level host /usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies,
but below some specified root directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--force</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When merging system extensions into /usr/ and /opt/, ignore version
incompatibilities, i.e. force merging regardless of whether the version
information included in the extension images matches the host or
not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-legend</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with
hints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--json=</strong><em>MODE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the
shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace or line
breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>On success, 0 is returned.</p>
