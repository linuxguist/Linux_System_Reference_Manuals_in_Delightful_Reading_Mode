<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>mkfs.exfat - create an exFAT filesystem</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>mkfs.exfat</strong> [ <strong>-b</strong>
<em>boundary_alignment</em> ] [ <strong>-c</strong>
<em>cluster_size</em> ] [ <strong>-f</strong> ] [ <strong>-h</strong> ]
[ <strong>-L</strong> <em>volume_label</em> ] [
<strong>--pack-bitmap</strong> ] [ <strong>-v</strong> ]
<em>device</em><br />
<strong>mkfs.exfat -V</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>mkfs.exfat</strong> creates an exFAT filesystem by writing on
a special file using the values found in the arguments of the command
line. It is invoked automatically by <strong>mkfs</strong>(8) when it is
given the <strong>-t exfat</strong> option.</p>
<p>As an example, to make a filesystem on the first partition on the
first SCSI disk, use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mkfs.exfat /dev/sda1</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-b</strong>,
<strong>--boundary-align</strong>=<em>alignment</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the alignment for the FAT and the start of the cluster
heap. The <em>alignment</em> argument is specified in bytes or may be
specified with <strong>m</strong>/<strong>M</strong> suffix for
mebibytes or <strong>k</strong>/<strong>K</strong> suffix for kibibytes
and should be a power of two. Some media like SD cards need this for
optimal performance and endurance, in which case <em>alignment</em>
should be set to half of the card's native boundary unit size. If the
card's native boundary unit size is not known, refer to the following
table of boundary unit sizes recommended by the SD Card Association.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>TABLE</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-c</strong>,
<strong>--cluster-size</strong>=<em>size</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the cluster size of the exFAT file system. The
<em>size</em> argument is specified in bytes or may be specified with
<strong>m</strong>/<strong>M</strong> suffix for mebibytes or
<strong>k</strong>/<strong>K</strong> suffix for kibibytes and must be a
power of two.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-f</strong>, <strong>--full-format</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs a full format. This zeros the entire disk device while
creating the exFAT filesystem.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the help and exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-L</strong>,
<strong>--volume-label</strong>=<em>label</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the volume label to be associated with the exFAT
filesystem.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--pack-bitmap</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Attempts to relocate the exFAT allocation bitmap so that it ends at
the alignment boundary immediately following the FAT rather than
beginning at that boundary. This strictly violates the SD card
specification but may improve performance and endurance on SD cards and
other flash media not designed for use with exFAT by allowing
file-system metadata updates to touch fewer flash allocation units.
Furthermore, many SD cards and other flash devices specially optimize
the allocation unit where the FAT resides so as to support tiny writes
with reduced write amplification but expect only larger writes in
subsequent allocation units â€” where the exFAT bitmap would be placed by
default. Specifying <strong>--pack-bitmap</strong> attempts to avoid the
potential problems associated with issuing many small writes to the
bitmap by making it share an allocation unit with the FAT. If there is
insufficient space for the bitmap there, then this option will have no
effect, and the bitmap will be aligned at the boundary as by
default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong>, <strong>--verbose</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints verbose debugging information while creating the exFAT
filesystem.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the version number and exits.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
