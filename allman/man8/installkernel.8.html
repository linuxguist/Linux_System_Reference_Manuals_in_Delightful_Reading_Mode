<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>installkernel - install a new kernel image</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>installkernel </strong><em>version zImage System.map
[directory]</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>installkernel</strong> installs a new kernel image onto the
system from the Linux source tree. It is called by the Linux kernel
makefiles when <strong>make install</strong> is invoked there.</p>
<p>The new kernel is installed into
<em>{directory}/vmlinuz-{version}</em>. If a symbolic link
<em>{directory}/vmlinuz</em> already exists, it is refreshed by making a
link from <em>{directory}/vmlinuz</em> to the new kernel, and the
previously installed kernel is available as
<em>{directory}/vmlinuz.old</em>.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p><strong>installkernel</strong> resides in /sbin only because the
Linux kernel makefiles call it from there. It should really be in
/usr/sbin. It isn't needed to boot a system.</p>
