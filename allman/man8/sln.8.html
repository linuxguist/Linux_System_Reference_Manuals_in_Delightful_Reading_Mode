<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sln - create symbolic links</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>sln source dest
sln filelist</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sln</strong> program creates symbolic links. Unlike the
<strong>ln</strong>(1) program, it is statically linked. This means that
if for some reason the dynamic linker is not working,
<strong>sln</strong> can be used to make symbolic links to dynamic
libraries.</p>
<p>The command line has two forms. In the first form, it creates
<em>dest</em> as a new symbolic link to <em>source</em>.</p>
<p>In the second form, <em>filelist</em> is a list of space-separated
pathname pairs, and the effect is as if <strong>sln</strong> was
executed once for each line of the file, with the two pathnames as the
arguments.</p>
<p>The <strong>sln</strong> program supports no command-line
options.</p>

<strong>ldconfig</strong>(8)</p>
