<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dpkg-fsys-usrunmess - undoes the merged-/usr-via-aliased-dirs
mess</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>dpkg-fsys-usrunmess</strong> [<strong>option</strong>...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>dpkg-fsys-usrunmess</strong> is a tool to fix up filesystems
that have been installed anew with recent installers with unfortunate
defaults or migrated to the broken merged /usr via aliased directories
layout, which is <strong>not</strong> supported by dpkg. See the dpkg
FAQ.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In Debian its tech-ctte has decreed that on
the release after bookworm the non-usrmerged layout is not going to be
supported, and thus some of its maintainers might not fix issues or
intentionally remove non-usrmerged support, so you will need decide and
pick your poison.</p>
<p>The program will perform the following overall actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check whether the system needs to be switched, otherwise do
nothing,</p></li>
<li><p>Check for dpkg database consistency and otherwise abort.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate and install a regression prevention package, if
requested on the command-line or otherwise on the prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the list of files and alternatives that need to be
restored.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for untracked kernel modules files that need to be moved
too.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a shadow hierarchy under <em>/.usrunmess</em>, by creating
the directories symlinks or hardlinking or copying the files as
needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt for confirmation before proceeding, if requested on the
command-line.</p></li>
<li><p>Lock the dpkg database.</p></li>
<li><p>Mark all packages as half-configured to force running maintainer
scripts that might need to recreate files.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the aliased directories with the shadow ones, by creating
a backup of the old symlinked directories and renaming the shadow ones
over.</p></li>
<li><p>Relabel MAC information for directories and symlinks if
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove backup symlinks.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove old moved objects, but defer directory removal.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove old deferred directories that are not referenced by
dpkg-query.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove shadow root directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Register a <strong>policy-rc.d</strong> to disallow service
actions, which means that services might need to be restarted
afterwards, ideally via a reboot.</p></li>
<li><p>Reconfigure all packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Unregister the <strong>policy-rc.d</strong> and restore the
alternatives state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When running the program from some shells such
as <strong>bash</strong> (1) or <strong>zsh</strong> (1), after
executing it, you might need to request the shell to forget all
remembered executable locations with for example
<code>hash -r</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some directories might linger after the
migration in case they contain untracked files. A list is printed once
the script has finished for further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Note that this operation has the potential
to render the system unusable or broken in case of a sudden crash or
reboot, unexpected state of the system, or possible bugs in the script.
Be prepared with recovery media and consider doing backups
beforehand.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-p, --prompt</dt>
<dd>
<p>Prompt at the time of no return, so that the debug output or the
shadow hierarchy can be evaluated before proceeding.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--prevention</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--no-prevention</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Enables or disables generating and installing a regression prevention
package into the system. If no option has been specified, the action to
take will be prompted. The generated package contains the
<strong>Protected</strong> field set to <strong>yes</strong> to protect
against accidental removal of the package.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-n, --no-act</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>--dry-run</dt>
<dd>

<p>This option enables the dry-run mode, where no destructive action
takes place, only the preparatory part.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-?, --help</dt>
<dd>
<p>Show the usage message and exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--version</dt>
<dd>
<p>Show the version and exit.</p>
