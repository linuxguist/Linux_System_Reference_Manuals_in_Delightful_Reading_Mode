<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pppoe-discovery - perform PPPoE discovery</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> [ <em>options</em> ]<br />
<strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> { <strong>-V</strong> |
<strong>-h</strong> }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> performs the same discovery process
as <strong>pppoe</strong>, but does not initiate a session. It sends a
PADI packet and then prints the names of access concentrators in each
PADO packet it receives.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-I</strong><em> interface</em></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-I</strong> option specifies the Ethernet interface to
use. Under Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1. The interface should be
“up” before you start <strong>pppoe-discovery</strong>, but should
<em>not</em> be configured to have an IP address. The default interface
is eth0.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-D</strong><em> file_name</em></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-D</strong> option causes every packet to be dumped to
the specified <em>file_name</em>. This is intended for debugging
only.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-U</strong></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Causes <strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> to use the Host-Uniq tag in
its discovery packets. The value of the tag is derived from the
process's PID number. This lets you run multiple instances of
<strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> and/or <strong>pppd</strong> without
having their discovery packets interfere with one another. You must
supply this option to <em>all</em> instances that you intend to run
simultaneously. This option is mutually exclusive with
<strong>-W</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-W</strong><em> value</em></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Causes <strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> to use the Host-Uniq tag in
its discovery packets. The value of the tag is taken from the option
argument, encoded as a string of hexadecimal digits. This lets you run
multiple instances of <strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> and/or
<strong>pppd</strong> without having their discovery packets interfere
with one another. You must supply this option to <em>all</em> instances
that you intend to run simultaneously. This option is mutually exclusive
with <strong>-U</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-S</strong><em> service_name</em></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the desired service name. <strong>pppoe-discovery</strong>
will only accept access concentrators which can provide the specified
service. In most cases, you should <em>not</em> specify this option. Use
it only if you know that there are multiple access concentrators or know
that you need a specific service name.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-C</strong><em> ac_name</em></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the desired access concentrator name.
<strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> will only accept the specified access
concentrator. In most cases, you should <em>not</em> specify this
option. Use it only if you know that there are multiple access
concentrators. If both the <strong>-S</strong> and <strong>-C</strong>
options are specified, they must <em>both</em> match.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-Q</strong></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Causes <strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> to avoid printing discovered
access concentrator names. This can be useful in scripts, which can use
the exit code of the program to determine whether any matching access
concentrators were discovered.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-t</strong><em> timeout</em></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes the discovery timeout for PADI requests, in seconds. The
default value is 5 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-a</strong><em> attempts</em></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes the number of PADI discovery attempts made. By default, 3
attempts are made to discover access concentrators before giving up.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V</strong> | <strong>-h</strong></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Either of these options causes <strong>pppoe-discovery</strong> to
print its version number and usage information, then exit.</p>
