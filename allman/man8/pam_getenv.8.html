<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pam_getenv - get environment variables from /etc/environment</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>pam_getenv <strong>[-l] [-s]</strong> <em>env_var</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This tool will print out the value of <em>env_var</em> from
<em>/etc/environment</em>. It will attempt to expand environment
variable references in the definition of <em>env_var</em> but will fail
if PAM items are expanded.</p>
<p>The <strong>-l</strong> option indicates the script should return an
environment variable related to default locale information.</p>
<p>The <strong>-s</strong> option indicates that the script should
return an system default environment variable.</p>
<p>Currently neither the <strong>-l</strong> or <strong>-s</strong>
options do anything. They are included because future versions of Debian
may have a separate repository for the initial environment used by init
scripts and for system locale information. These options will allow this
script to be a stable interface even in that environment.</p>
