<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>e2scrub_all - check all mounted ext[234] file systems for errors.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>e2scrub_all [OPTION]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Searches the system for all LVM logical volumes containing an ext2,
ext3, or ext4 file system, and checks them for problems. The checking is
performed by invoking the <strong>e2scrub</strong> tool, which will look
for corruptions. Corrupt file systems will be tagged as having errors so
that fsck will be invoked before the next mount. If no errors are
encountered, <strong>fstrim</strong> will be called on the file system
if it is mounted. See the <strong>e2scrub</strong> manual page for more
information about how the checking is performed.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-n</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print what commands <strong>e2scrub_all</strong> would execute to
initiate the e2scrub operations. (Note: these commands will not actually
be executed; however, since <strong>e2scrub_all</strong> needs to run
some additional, privileged commands to query the system to determine
which <strong>e2scrub</strong> commands would be executed, it still
needs to be run as root.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-r</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove e2scrub snapshots but do not check anything.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-A</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Scrub all ext[234] file systems even if they are not mounted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print version information and exit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
