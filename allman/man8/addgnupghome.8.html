<h1>NAME</h1>
<p><strong>addgnupghome</strong> - Create .gnupg home directories</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>addgnupghome</strong> <em>account_1</em>
<em>account_2</em>...<em>account_n</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>If GnuPG is installed on a system with existing user accounts, it is
sometimes required to populate the GnuPG home directory with existing
files. Especially a ‘<em>trustlist.txt</em>’ and a keybox with some
initial certificates are often desired. This script helps to do this by
copying all files from ‘<em>/etc/skel/.gnupg</em>’ to the home
directories of the accounts given on the command line. It takes care not
to overwrite existing GnuPG home directories.</p>
<p><strong>addgnupghome</strong> is invoked by root as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>addgnupghome account1 account2 ... accountn</code></pre>
</blockquote>
