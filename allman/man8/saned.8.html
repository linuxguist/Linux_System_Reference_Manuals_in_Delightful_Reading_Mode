<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>saned - SANE network daemon</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>saned</strong> <strong>[ -a</strong> <em>[ username ]</em>
<strong>]</strong> <strong>[ -u</strong> <em>username</em>
<strong>]</strong> <strong>[ -b</strong> <em>address</em>
<strong>]</strong> <strong>[ -p</strong> <em>port</em>
<strong>]</strong> <strong>[ -l ]</strong> <strong>[ -D ]</strong>
<strong>[ -o ]</strong> <strong>[ -d</strong> <em>n</em>
<strong>]</strong> <strong>[ -e ]</strong> <strong>[ -h ]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>saned</strong> is the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) daemon
that allows remote clients to access image acquisition devices available
on the local host.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>saned</strong> recognises the following options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-a</strong> <em>[username]</em>,
<strong>--alone</strong>[=<em>username]</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>is equivalent to the combination of <strong>-l -D -u</strong>
<em>username</em> options. However, <em>username</em> is optional and
running user will only be set when specified.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-u</strong> <em>username</em>,
<strong>--user</strong>=<em>username</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>requests that <strong>saned</strong> drop root privileges and run as
the user (and group) associated with <em>username</em> after
binding.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-b</strong> <em>address</em>,
<strong>--bind</strong>=<em>address</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>tells <strong>saned</strong> to bind to the <em>address</em>
given.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-p</strong> <em>port</em>,
<strong>--port=<em>port</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>tells <strong>saned</strong> to listen on the <em>port</em> given. A
value of 0 tells <strong>saned</strong> to pick an unused port. The
default is the <strong>sane-port (6566).</strong></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-l</strong>, <strong>--listen</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>requests that <strong>saned</strong> run in standalone daemon mode.
In this mode, <strong>saned</strong> will listen for incoming client
connections; <strong>inetd</strong>(8) is not required for
<strong>saned</strong> operations in this mode.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-D</strong>, <strong>--daemonize</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>will request <strong>saned</strong> to detach from the console and
run in the background.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-o</strong>, <strong>--once</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>requests that <strong>saned</strong> exits after the first client
disconnects. This is useful for debugging.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-d</strong> <em>n</em>,
<strong>--debug</strong>=<em>n</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the level of <strong>saned</strong> debug output to <em>n</em>.
When compiled with debugging enabled, this flag may be followed by a
number to request more or less debug info. The larger the number, the
more verbose the debug output. E.g., <strong>-d128</strong> will request
output of all debug info. A level of 0 produces no output at all. The
default value is 2.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-e</strong>, <strong>--stderr</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>will divert <strong>saned</strong> debug output to stderr instead of
the syslog default.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>displays a short help message.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <strong>saned</strong> is run from other programs such as
<strong>inetd</strong>(8), <strong>xinetd</strong>(8) and
<strong>systemd</strong>(1), check that program's documentation on how
to pass command-line options.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>First and foremost: <strong>saned</strong> is not intended to be
exposed to the internet or other non-trusted networks. Make sure that
access is limited by tcpwrappers and/or a firewall setup. Don't depend
only on <strong>saned</strong>'s own authentication. Don't run
<strong>saned</strong> as root if it's not necessary. And do
<strong>not</strong> install <strong>saned</strong> as setuid root.</p>
<p>The <em>saned.conf</em> configuration file contains both options for
the daemon and the access list.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>data_portrange</strong> = <em>min_port</em> -
<em>max_port</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the port range to use for the data connection. Pick a port
range between 1024 and 65535; don't pick a too large port range, as it
may have performance issues. Use this option if your
<strong>saned</strong> server is sitting behind a firewall. If that
firewall is a Linux machine, we strongly recommend using the Netfilter
<em>nf_conntrack_sane</em> module instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>data_connect_timeout</strong> = <em>timeout</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the time in milliseconds that <strong>saned</strong> will
wait for a data connection. Without this option, if the data connection
is not done before the scanner reaches the end of scan, the scanner will
continue to scan past the end and may damage it depending on the
backend. Specify zero to have the old behavior. The default is
4000ms.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The access list is a list of host names, IP addresses or IP subnets
(CIDR notation) that are permitted to use local SANE devices. IPv6
addresses must be enclosed in brackets, and should always be specified
in their compressed form. Connections from localhost are always
permitted. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. A line containing the single character ``+'' is interpreted to
match any hostname. This allows any remote machine to use your scanner
and may present a security risk, so this shouldn't be used unless you
know what you're doing.</p>
<p>A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># Daemon options<br />
data_portrange = 10000 - 10100<br />
# Access list<br />
scan-client.somedomain.firm<br />
# this is a comment<br />
192.168.0.1<br />
192.168.2.12/29<br />
[::1]<br />
[2001:db8:185e::42:12]/64</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case of the host names does not matter, so AHost.COM is
considered identical to ahost.com.</p>
<h1>SERVER DAEMON CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>For <strong>saned</strong> to work properly in its default mode of
operation, it is also necessary to add the appropriate configuration for
<strong>xinetd</strong>(8), <strong>inetd</strong>(8) or
<strong>systemd</strong>(1) (see below). Note that your
<strong>inetd</strong>(8) must support IPv6 if you want to connect to
<strong>saned</strong> over IPv6; <strong>xinetd</strong>(8),
<strong>openbsd-inetd</strong>(8) and <strong>systemd</strong>(1) are
known to support IPv6, check the documentation for your
<strong>inetd</strong>(8) daemon.</p>
<p>In the sections below the configuration for
<strong>inetd</strong>(8), <strong>xinetd</strong>(8) and
<strong>systemd</strong>(1) are described in more detail.</p>
<p>For the configurations below it is necessary to add a line of the
following form to <em>/etc/services</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official IANA short name for port 6566 is "sane-port". The older
name "sane" is now deprecated.</p>
<h1>INETD CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>It is required to add a single line to the <strong>inetd</strong>(8)
configuration file <em>(/etc/inetd.conf)</em></p>
<p>The configuration line normally looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sane-port stream tcp nowait saned.saned /usr/sbin/saned saned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if your system uses <strong>tcpd</strong>(8) for additional
security screening, you may want to disable <strong>saned</strong>
access control by putting ``+'' in <em>saned.conf</em> and use a line of
the following form in <em>/etc/inetd.conf</em> instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sane-port stream tcp nowait saned.saned /usr/sbin/tcpd
/usr/sbin/saned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that both examples assume that there is a <strong>saned</strong>
group and a <strong>saned</strong> user. If you follow this example,
please make sure that the access permissions on the special device are
set such that <strong>saned</strong> can access the scanner (the program
generally needs read and write access to scanner devices).</p>
<h1>XINETD CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>If <strong>xinetd</strong>(8) is installed on your system instead of
<strong>inetd</strong>(8) the following example for
<em>/etc/xinetd.conf</em> may be helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># default: off
# description: The sane server accepts requests
# for network access to a local scanner via the
# network.
service sane-port
{
   port        = 6566
   socket_type = stream
   wait        = no
   user        = saned
   group       = saned
   server      = /usr/sbin/saned
}</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>SYSTEMD CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p><strong>saned</strong> can be compiled with explicit
<strong>systemd</strong>(1) support. This will allow logging debugging
information to be forwarded to the <strong>systemd</strong>(1) journal.
The <strong>systemd</strong>(1) support requires compilation with the
systemd-devel package installed on the system. This is the preferred
option.</p>
<p><strong>saned</strong> can be used with <strong>systemd</strong>(1)
without the <strong>systemd</strong>(1) integration compiled in, but
then logging of debug information is not supported.</p>
<p>The <strong>systemd</strong>(1) configuration is different for the 2
options, so both are described below.</p>
<h1>Systemd configuration for saned with systemd support compiled
in</h1>
<p>For <strong>systemd</strong>(1) configuration we need to add 2
configuration files in <em>/etc/systemd/system</em>.</p>
<p>The first file we need to add here is called <em>saned.socket.</em>
It shall have the following contents:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=saned incoming socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=6566
Accept=yes
MaxConnections=1

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The second file to be added is <em>saned@.service</em> with the
following contents:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Scanner Service
Requires=saned.socket

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/saned
User=saned
Group=saned
StandardInput=null
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
Environment=SANE_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/sane.d
# If you need to debug your configuration uncomment the next line and
# change it as appropriate to set the desired debug options
# Environment=SANE_DEBUG_DLL=255 SANE_DEBUG_BJNP=5

[Install]
Also=saned.socket</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to set an environment variable for
<strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> pointing to the directory where
<strong>saned</strong> can find its configuration files. You will have
to remove the # on the last line and set the variables for the desired
debugging information if required. Multiple variables can be set by
separating the assignments by spaces as shown in the example above.</p>
<p>Unlike <strong>xinetd</strong>(8) and <strong>inetd</strong>(8),
<strong>systemd</strong>(1) allows debugging output from backends set
using <strong>SANE_DEBUG_XXX</strong> to be captured. See the man-page
for your backend to see what options are supported. With the service
unit as described above, the debugging output is forwarded to the system
log.</p>
<h1>Systemd configuration when saned is compiled without systemd
support</h1>
<p>This configuration will also work when <strong>saned</strong> is
compiled WITH <strong>systemd</strong>(1) integration support, but it
does not allow debugging information to be logged.</p>
<p>For <strong>systemd</strong>(1) configuration for
<strong>saned</strong>, we need to add 2 configuration files in
<em>/etc/systemd/system</em>.</p>
<p>The first file we need to add here is called <em>saned.socket.</em>
It is identical to the version for <strong>systemd</strong>(1) with the
support compiled in. It shall have the following contents:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=saned incoming socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=6566
Accept=yes
MaxConnections=1

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The second file to be added is <em>saned@.service</em>. This one
differs from the version with <strong>systemd</strong>(1) integration
compiled in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Scanner Service
Requires=saned.socket

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/saned
User=saned
Group=saned
StandardInput=socket

Environment=SANE_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/sane.d

[Install]
Also=saned.socket</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/hosts.equiv</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The hosts listed in this file are permitted to access all local SANE
devices. Caveat: this file imposes serious security risks and its use is
not recommended.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/saned.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains a list of hosts permitted to access local SANE devices (see
also description of <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/saned.users</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this file contains lines of the form</p>
<p>user:password:backend</p>
<p>access to the listed backends is restricted. A backend may be listed
multiple times for different user/password combinations. The server uses
MD5 hashing if supported by the client.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in <em>/etc/sane.d</em>. If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories <em>tmp/config</em>,
<em>.</em>, and <em>/etc/sane.d</em> being searched (in this order).</p>
