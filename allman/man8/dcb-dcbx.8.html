<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dcb-dcbx - show / manipulate port DCBX (Data Center Bridging
eXchange)</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>dcb</strong> [ <em>OPTIONS</em> ] <strong>dcbx</strong> {
<em>COMMAND</em> | <em>help</em> }</p>
<p><strong>dcb dcbx show dev</strong> DEV</p>
<p><strong>dcb dcbx set dev</strong> DEV [ <strong>host</strong> ] [
<strong>lld-managed</strong> ] [ <strong>cee</strong> ] [
<strong>ieee</strong> ] [ <strong>static</strong> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Data Center Bridging eXchange (DCBX) is a protocol used by DCB
devices to exchange configuration information with directly connected
peers. The Linux DCBX object is a 1-byte bitfield of flags that
configure whether DCBX is implemented in the device or in the host, and
which version of the protocol should be used. <strong>dcb dcbx</strong>
is used to access the per-port Linux DCBX object.</p>
<p>There are two principal modes of operation: in <strong>host</strong>
mode, DCBX protocol is implemented by the host LLDP agent, and the DCB
interfaces are used to propagate the negotiate parameters to capable
devices. In <strong>lld-managed</strong> mode, the configuration is
handled by the device, and DCB interfaces are used for inspection of
negotiated parameters, and can also be used to set initial
parameters.</p>
<h1>PARAMETERS</h1>
<p>When used with <strong>dcb dcbx set,</strong> the following keywords
enable the corresponding configuration. The keywords that are not
mentioned on the command line are considered disabled. When used with
<strong>show,</strong> each enabled feature is shown by its
corresponding keyword.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>host</strong><br />
<strong>lld-managed</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The device is in the host mode of operation and, respectively, the
lld-managed mode of operation, as described above. In principle these
two keywords are mutually exclusive, but <strong>dcb dcbx</strong>
allows setting both and lets the driver handle it as appropriate.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>cee</strong><br />
<strong>ieee</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The device supports CEE (Converged Enhanced Ethernet) and,
respectively, IEEE version of the DCB specification. Typically only one
of these will be set, but <strong>dcb dcbx</strong> does not mandate
this.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>static</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>indicates the engine supports static configuration. No actual
negotiation is performed, negotiated parameters are always the initial
configuration.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p>Put the DCB engine into the "host" mode of operation, and use
IEEE-standardized DCB interfaces:</p>
<p># dcb dcbx set dev eth0 host ieee</p>
<p>Show what was set:</p>
<p># dcb dcbx show dev eth0<br />
host ieee</p>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer upon
failure.</p>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p><strong>dcb</strong>(8)</p>
<h1>REPORTING BUGS</h1>
<p>Report any bugs to the Network Developers mailing list
<strong>&lt;netdev@vger.kernel.org&gt;</strong> where the development
and maintenance is primarily done. You do not have to be subscribed to
the list to send a message there.</p>
