<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>kernel-install - Add and remove kernel and initrd images to and from
/boot</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>kernel-install</strong> [OPTIONS...] COMMAND
<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em> <em>KERNEL-IMAGE</em>
[<em>INITRD-FILE</em>...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>kernel-install</strong> is used to install and remove kernel
and initrd images [1] to and from the boot loader partition, referred to
as <em>$BOOT</em> here. It will usually be one of /boot/, /efi/, or
/boot/efi/, see below.</p>
<p><strong>kernel-install</strong> will run the executable files
("plugins") located in the directory /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/ and the
local administration directory /etc/kernel/install.d/. All files are
collectively sorted and executed in lexical order, regardless of the
directory in which they live. However, files with identical filenames
replace each other. Files in /etc/kernel/install.d/ take precedence over
files with the same name in /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/. This can be used
to override a system-supplied executables with a local file if needed; a
symbolic link in /etc/kernel/install.d/ with the same name as an
executable in /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/, pointing to /dev/null,
disables the executable entirely. Executables must have the extension
".install"; other extensions are ignored.</p>
<p>An executable placed in these directories should return
<strong>0</strong> on success. It may also return <strong>77</strong> to
cause the whole operation to terminate (executables later in lexical
order will be skipped).</p>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<p>The following commands are understood:</p>
<p><strong>add</strong> <em>KERNEL-VERSION</em> <strong></strong>
<em>KERNEL-IMAGE</em> <strong>[</strong><em>INITRD-FILE</em>
<strong>...]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This command expects a kernel version string and a path to a kernel
image file as arguments. Optionally, one or more initrd images may be
specified as well (note that plugins might generate additional ones).
<strong>kernel-install</strong> calls the executable files from
/usr/lib/kernel/install.d/*.install and /etc/kernel/install.d/*.install
(i.e. the plugins) with the following arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add KERNEL-VERSION $BOOT/ENTRY-TOKEN/KERNEL-VERSION/ KERNEL-IMAGE [INITRD-FILE ...]</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The third argument directly refers to the path where to place kernel
images, initrd images and other resources for <strong>Boot Loader
Specification</strong>[2] Type #1 entries (the "entry directory"). If
other boot loader schemes are used the parameter may be ignored. The
<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em> string is typically the machine ID and is supposed
to identify the local installation on the system. For details see
below.</p>
<p>Two default plugins execute the following operations in this
case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>kernel-install</strong> creates
$BOOT/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>/<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>, if enabled (see
<em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>50-depmod.install runs <strong>depmod</strong>(8) for the
<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>90-loaderentry.install copies <em>KERNEL-IMAGE</em> to
$BOOT/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>/<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>/linux. If
<em>INITRD-FILE</em>s are provided, it also copies them to
$BOOT/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>/<em>KERNEL_VERSION</em>/<em>INITRD-FILE</em>.
It also creates a boot loader entry according to the <strong>Boot Loader
Specification</strong>[2] (Type #1) in
$BOOT/loader/entries/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>-<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>.conf.
The title of the entry is the <em>PRETTY_NAME</em> parameter specified
in /etc/os-release or /usr/lib/os-release (if the former is missing), or
"Linux <em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>", if unset.</p>
<p>If <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT</em> is not "bls", this plugin does
nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>remove</strong> <em>KERNEL-VERSION</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This command expects a kernel version string as single argument. This
calls executables from /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/*.install and
/etc/kernel/install.d/*.install with the following arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>remove KERNEL-VERSION $BOOT/ENTRY-TOKEN/KERNEL-VERSION/</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Afterwards, <strong>kernel-install</strong> removes the entry
directory $BOOT/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>/<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>/ and its
contents, if it exists.</p>
<p>Two default plugins execute the following operations in this
case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>50-depmod.install removes the files generated by
<strong>depmod</strong> for this kernel again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>90-loaderentry.install removes the file
$BOOT/loader/entries/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>-<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>.conf.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>inspect</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows the various paths and parameters configured or auto-detected.
In particular shows the values of the various <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_*</em>
environment variables listed below.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>THE FI$BOOTFR PARTITION</h1>
<p>The partition where the kernels and <strong>Boot Loader
Specification</strong>[2] snippets are located is called <em>$BOOT</em>.
<strong>kernel-install</strong> determines the location of this
partition by checking /efi/, /boot/, and /boot/efi/ in turn. The first
location where $BOOT/loader/entries/ or $BOOT/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>/
exists is used.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p><strong>-v</strong>, <strong>--verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output additional information about operations being performed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h1>
<h2>Environment variables exported for plugins</h2>
<p>If <strong>--verbose</strong> is used,
<em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_VERBOSE=1</em> will be exported for plugins. They
may output additional logs in this case.</p>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</em> is set for the plugins to the
desired machine-id to use. Its always a 128-bit ID. Normally its read
from /etc/machine-id, but it can also be overridden via
<em>$MACHINE_ID</em> (see below). If not specified via these methods a
fallback value will generated by <strong>kernel-install</strong>, and
used only for a single invocation.</p>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_ENTRY_TOKEN</em> is set for the plugins to the
desired entry "token" to use. Its an identifier that shall be used to
identify the local installation, and is often the machine ID, i.e. same
as <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</em>, but might also be a different
type of identifier, for example a fixed string or the <em>ID=</em>,
<em>IMAGE_ID=</em> values from /etc/os-release. The string passed here
will be used to name Boot Loader Specification entries, or the
directories the kernel image and initial RAM disk images are placed
into.</p>
<p>Note that while <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_ENTRY_TOKEN</em> and
<em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</em> are often set to the same value, the
latter is guaranteed to be a valid 32 character ID in lowercase
hexadecimals while the former can be any short string. The entry token
to use is read from /etc/kernel/entry-token, if it exists. Otherwise a
few possible candidates below <em>$BOOT</em> are checked for Boot Loader
Specification Type 1 entry directories, and if found the entry token is
derived from that. If that is not successful,
<em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</em> is used as fallback.</p>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_BOOT_ROOT</em> is set for the plugins to the
absolute path of the root directory (mount point, usually) of the
hierarchy where boot loader entries, kernel images, and associated
resources should be placed. This usually is the path where the XBOOTLDR
partition or the ESP (EFI System Partition) are mounted, and also
conceptually referred to as <em>$BOOT</em>. Can be overridden by setting
<em>$BOOT_ROOT</em> (see below).</p>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT=bls|other|...</em> is set for the plugins
to specify the installation layout. Defaults to <strong>bls</strong> if
$BOOT/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em> exists, or <strong>other</strong> otherwise.
Additional layout names may be defined by convention. If a plugin uses a
special layout, its encouraged to declare its own layout name and
configure <em>layout=</em> in install.conf upon initial installation.
The following values are currently understood:</p>
<p>bls</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Standard <strong>Boot Loader Specification</strong>[2] Type #1
layout, compatible with <strong>systemd-boot</strong>(7): entries in
$BOOT/loader/entries/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>-<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>[+<em>TRIES</em>].conf,
kernel and initrds under
$BOOT/<em>ENTRY-TOKEN</em>/<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>/</p>
<p>Implemented by 90-loaderentry.install.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>other</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some other layout not understood natively by
<strong>kernel-install</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_INITRD_GENERATOR</em> is set for plugins to
select the initrd generator. This may be configured as
<em>initrd_generator=</em> in install.conf, see below.</p>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_STAGING_AREA</em> is set for plugins to a path to
a directory. Plugins may drop files in that directory, and they will be
installed as part of the loader entry, based on the file name and
extension.</p>
<h2>Environment variables understood by kernel-install</h2>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</em> can be set to override the
location of the configuration files read by
<strong>kernel-install</strong>. When set, install.conf, entry-token,
and other files will be read from this directory.</p>
<p><em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_PLUGINS</em> can be set to override the list of
plugins executed by <strong>kernel-install</strong>. The argument is a
whitespace-separated list of paths. "KERNEL_INSTALL_PLUGINS=:" may be
used to prevent any plugins from running.</p>
<p><em>$MACHINE_ID</em> can be set for <strong>kernel-install</strong>
to override <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</em>, the machine ID.</p>
<p><em>$BOOT_ROOT</em> can be set for <strong>kernel-install</strong> to
override <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_BOOT_ROOT</em>, the installation location
for boot entries.</p>
<p>The last two variables may also be set in install.conf. Variables set
in the environment take precedence over the values specified in the
config file.</p>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>If every executable returns 0 or 77, 0 is returned, and a non-zero
failure code otherwise.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>/usr/lib/kernel/install.d/*.install
/etc/kernel/install.d/*.install</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drop-in files which are executed by kernel-install.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/usr/lib/kernel/cmdline /etc/kernel/cmdline /proc/cmdline</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read by 90-loaderentry.install. The content of the file
/etc/kernel/cmdline specifies the kernel command line to use. If that
file does not exist, /usr/lib/kernel/cmdline is used. If that also does
not exist, /proc/cmdline is used. <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</em> may
be used to override the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/etc/kernel/tries</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read by 90-loaderentry.install. If this file exists a numeric value
is read from it and the naming of the generated entry file is slightly
altered to include it as
$BOOT/loader/entries/<em>MACHINE-ID</em>-<em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>+<em>TRIES</em>.conf.
This is useful for boot loaders such as <strong>systemd-boot</strong>(7)
which implement boot attempt counting with a counter embedded in the
entry file name. <em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</em> may be used to
override the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/etc/kernel/entry-token</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this file exists it is read and used as "entry token" for this
system, i.e. is used for naming Boot Loader Specification entries, see
<em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_ENTRY_TOKEN</em> above for details.
<em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</em> may be used to override the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/etc/machine-id</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The content of this file specifies the machine identification
<em>MACHINE-ID</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/etc/os-release /usr/lib/os-release</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read by 90-loaderentry.install. If available, <em>PRETTY_NAME=</em>
is read from these files and used as the title of the boot menu entry.
Otherwise, "Linux <em>KERNEL-VERSION</em>" will be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/usr/lib/kernel/install.conf /etc/kernel/install.conf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configuration options for <strong>kernel-install</strong>, as a
series of <em>KEY=VALUE</em> assignments, compatible with shell syntax,
following the same rules as described in <strong>os-release</strong>(5).
/etc/kernel/install.conf will be read if present, and
/usr/lib/kernel/install.conf otherwise. This file is optional.
<em>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</em> may be used to override the path.</p>
<p>Currently, the following keys are supported: <em>MACHINE_ID=</em>,
<em>BOOT_ROOT=</em>, <em>layout=</em>, <em>initrd_generator=</em>. See
the Environment variables section above for details.</p>
