<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>start-stop-daemon - start and stop system daemon programs</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> [<em>option</em>...]
<em>command</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> is used to control the creation
and termination of system-level processes. Using one of the matching
options, <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> can be configured to find
existing instances of a running process.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unless <strong>--pid</strong> or
<strong>--pidfile</strong> are specified,
<strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> behaves similar to
<strong>killall</strong>(1). <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> will
scan the process table looking for any processes which match the process
name, parent pid, uid, and/or gid (if specified). Any matching process
will prevent <strong>--start</strong> from starting the daemon. All
matching processes will be sent the TERM signal (or the one specified
via <strong>--signal</strong> or <strong>--retry</strong>) if
<strong>--stop</strong> is specified. For daemons which have long-lived
children which need to live through a <strong>--stop</strong>, you must
specify a pidfile.</p>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-S, --start [--] arguments</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check for the existence of a specified process. If such a process
exists, <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> does nothing, and exits with
error status 1 (0 if <strong>--oknodo</strong> is specified). If such a
process does not exist, it starts an instance, using either the
executable specified by <strong>--exec</strong> or, if specified, by
<strong>--startas</strong>. Any arguments given after
<strong>--</strong> on the command line are passed unmodified to the
program being started.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-K, --stop</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks for the existence of a specified process. If such a process
exists, <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> sends it the signal specified
by <strong>--signal</strong>, and exits with error status 0. If such a
process does not exist, <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> exits with
error status 1 (0 if <strong>--oknodo</strong> is specified). If
<strong>--retry</strong> is specified, then
<strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> will check that the process(es) have
terminated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-T, --status</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check for the existence of a specified process, and returns an exit
status code, according to the LSB Init Script Actions (since version
1.16.1).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-H, --help</dt>
<dd>
<p>Show usage information and exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-V, --version</dt>
<dd>
<p>Show the program version and exit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<h2>Matching options</h2>
<dl>
<dt>--pid pid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check for a process with the specified <em>pid</em> (since version
1.17.6). The <em>pid</em> must be a number greater than 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--ppid ppid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check for a process with the specified parent pid <em>ppid</em>
(since version 1.17.7). The <em>ppid</em> must be a number greater than
0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-p, --pidfile pidfile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check whether a process has created the file <em>pidfile</em>.
<strong>Note:</strong> Using this matching option alone might cause
unintended processes to be acted on, if the old process terminated
without being able to remove the <em>pidfile</em>.
<strong>Warning:</strong> Using this match option with a world-writable
pidfile or using it alone with a daemon that writes the pidfile as an
unprivileged (non-root) user will be refused with an error (since
version 1.19.3) as this is a security risk, because either any user can
write to it, or if the daemon gets compromised, the contents of the
pidfile cannot be trusted, and then a privileged runner (such as an init
script executed as root) would end up acting on any system process.
Using <em>/dev/null</em> is exempt from these checks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-x, --exec executable</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check for processes that are instances of this <em>executable</em>.
The <em>executable</em> argument should be an absolute pathname.
<strong>Note:</strong> This might not work as intended with interpreted
scripts, as the executable will point to the interpreter. Take into
account processes running from inside a chroot will also be matched, so
other match restrictions might be needed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-n, --name process-name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check for processes with the name <em>process-name</em>. The
<em>process-name</em> is usually the process filename, but it could have
been changed by the process itself. <strong>Note:</strong> On most
systems this information is retrieved from the process comm name from
the kernel, which tends to have a relatively short length limit
(assuming more than 15 characters is non-portable).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-u, --user username|uid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check for processes owned by the user specified by <em>username</em>
or <em>uid</em>. <strong>Note:</strong> Using this matching option alone
will cause all processes matching the user to be acted on.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Generic options</h2>
<dl>
<dt>-g, --group group|gid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Change to <em>group</em> or <em>gid</em> when starting the
process.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-s, --signal signal</dt>
<dd>
<p>With <strong>--stop</strong>, specifies the signal to send to
processes being stopped (default TERM).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-R, --retry timeout|schedule</dt>
<dd>
<p>With <strong>--stop</strong>, specifies that
<strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> is to check whether the process(es)
do finish. It will check repeatedly whether any matching processes are
running, until none are. If the processes do not exit it will then take
further action as determined by the schedule. If <em>timeout</em> is
specified instead of <em>schedule</em>, then the schedule
<em>signal</em><strong>/</strong><em>timeout</em><strong>/KILL/</strong><em>timeout</em>
is used, where <em>signal</em> is the signal specified with
<strong>--signal</strong>. <em>schedule</em> is a list of at least two
items separated by slashes (<strong>/</strong>); each item may be
<strong>-</strong><em>signal-number</em> or
[<strong>-</strong>]<em>signal-name</em>, which means to send that
signal, or <em>timeout</em>, which means to wait that many seconds for
processes to exit, or <strong>forever</strong>, which means to repeat
the rest of the schedule forever if necessary. If the end of the
schedule is reached and <strong>forever</strong> is not specified, then
<strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> exits with error status 2. If a
schedule is specified, then any signal specified with
<strong>--signal</strong> is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-a, --startas pathname</dt>
<dd>
<p>With <strong>--start</strong>, start the process specified by
<em>pathname</em>. If not specified, defaults to the argument given to
<strong>--exec</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-t, --test</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print actions that would be taken and set appropriate return value,
but take no action.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-o, --oknodo</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return exit status 0 instead of 1 if no actions are (would be)
taken.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-q, --quiet</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not print informational messages; only display error messages.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-c, --chuid username|uid[:group|gid]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Change to this username/uid before starting the process. You can also
specify a group by appending a <strong>:</strong>, then the group or gid
in the same way as you would for the <strong>chown</strong>(1) command
(<em>user</em><strong>:</strong><em>group</em>). If a user is specified
without a group, the primary GID for that user is used. When using this
option you must realize that the primary and supplemental groups are set
as well, even if the <strong>--group</strong> option is not specified.
The <strong>--group</strong> option is only for groups that the user
isn't normally a member of (like adding per process group membership for
generic users like <strong>nobody</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-r, --chroot root</dt>
<dd>
<p>Change directory and chroot to <em>root</em> before starting the
process. Please note that the pidfile is also written after the
chroot.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-d, --chdir path</dt>
<dd>
<p>Change directory to <em>path</em> before starting the process. This
is done after the chroot if the
<strong>-r</strong>|<strong>--chroot</strong> option is set. When not
specified, <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> will change directory to
the root directory before starting the process.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-b, --background</dt>
<dd>
<p>Typically used with programs that don't detach on their own. This
option will force <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> to fork before
starting the process, and force it into the background. <strong>Warning:
start-stop-daemon</strong> cannot check the exit status if the process
fails to execute for <strong>any</strong> reason. This is a last resort,
and is only meant for programs that either make no sense forking on
their own, or where it's not feasible to add the code for them to do
this themselves.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--notify-await</dt>
<dd>
<p>Wait for the background process to send a readiness notification
before considering the service started (since version 1.19.3). This
implements parts of the systemd readiness protocol, as specified in the
<strong>sd_notify</strong>(3) man page. The following variables are
supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>READY=1</dt>
<dd>
<p>The program is ready to give service, so we can exit safely.</p>
</dd>
<dt>EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=number</dt>
<dd>
<p>The program requests to extend the timeout by <em>number</em>
microseconds. This will reset the current timeout to the specified
value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ERRNO=number</dt>
<dd>
<p>The program is exiting with an error. Do the same and print the
user-friendly string for the <strong>errno</strong> value.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>--notify-timeout timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set a timeout for the <strong>--notify-await</strong> option (since
version 1.19.3). When the timeout is reached,
<strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> will exit with an error code, and no
readiness notification will be awaited. The default is
<strong>60</strong> seconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-C, --no-close</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not close any file descriptor when forcing the daemon into the
background (since version 1.16.5). Used for debugging purposes to see
the process output, or to redirect file descriptors to log the process
output. Only relevant when using <strong>--background</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-O, --output pathname</dt>
<dd>
<p>Redirect <strong>stdout</strong> and <strong>stderr</strong> to
<em>pathname</em> when forcing the daemon into the background (since
version 1.20.6). Only relevant when using
<strong>--background</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-N, --nicelevel int</dt>
<dd>
<p>This alters the priority of the process before starting it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-P, --procsched policy:priority</dt>
<dd>
<p>This alters the process scheduler policy and priority of the process
before starting it (since version 1.15.0). The priority can be
optionally specified by appending a <strong>:</strong> followed by the
value. The default <em>priority</em> is 0. The currently supported
policy values are <strong>other</strong>, <strong>fifo</strong> and
<strong>rr</strong>. This option might do nothing on some systems, where
POSIX process scheduling is not supported.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-I, --iosched class:priority</dt>
<dd>
<p>This alters the IO scheduler class and priority of the process before
starting it (since version 1.15.0). The priority can be optionally
specified by appending a <strong>:</strong> followed by the value. The
default <em>priority</em> is 4, unless <em>class</em> is
<strong>idle</strong>, then <em>priority</em> will always be 7. The
currently supported values for <em>class</em> are <strong>idle</strong>,
<strong>best-effort</strong> and <strong>real-time</strong>. This option
might do nothing on some systems, where Linux IO scheduling is not
supported.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-k, --umask mask</dt>
<dd>
<p>This sets the umask of the process before starting it (since version
1.13.22).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-m, --make-pidfile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Used when starting a program that does not create its own pid file.
This option will make <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> create the file
referenced with <strong>--pidfile</strong> and place the pid into it
just before executing the process. Note, the file will only be removed
when stopping the program if <strong>--remove-pidfile</strong> is used.
<strong>Note:</strong> This feature may not work in all cases. Most
notably when the program being executed forks from its main process.
Because of this, it is usually only useful when combined with the
<strong>--background</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--remove-pidfile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Used when stopping a program that does not remove its own pid file
(since version 1.17.19). This option will make
<strong>start-stop-daemon</strong> remove the file referenced with
<strong>--pidfile</strong> after terminating the process.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-v, --verbose</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print verbose informational messages.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>The requested action was performed. If <strong>--oknodo</strong>
was specified, it's also possible that nothing had to be done. This can
happen when <strong>--start</strong> was specified and a matching
process was already running, or when <strong>--stop</strong> was
specified and there were no matching processes.</p></li>
<li><p>If <strong>--oknodo</strong> was not specified and nothing was
done.</p></li>
<li><p>If <strong>--stop</strong> and <strong>--retry</strong> were
specified, but the end of the schedule was reached and the processes
were still running.</p></li>
<li><p>Any other error.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When using the <strong>--status</strong> command, the following
status codes are returned:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>Program is running.</p></li>
<li><p>Program is not running and the pid file exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Program is not running.</p></li>
<li><p>Unable to determine program status.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Start the <strong>food</strong> daemon, unless one is already running
(a process named food, running as user food, with pid in food.pid):
start-stop-daemon --start --oknodo --user food --name food \ --pidfile
/run/food.pid --startas /usr/sbin/food \ --chuid food -- --daemon</p>
<p>Send <strong>SIGTERM</strong> to <strong>food</strong> and wait up to
5 seconds for it to stop: start-stop-daemon --stop --oknodo --user food
--name food \ --pidfile /run/food.pid --retry 5</p>
<p>Demonstration of a custom schedule for stopping
<strong>food</strong>: start-stop-daemon --stop --oknodo --user food
--name food \ --pidfile /run/food.pid --retry=TERM/30/KILL/5</p>
