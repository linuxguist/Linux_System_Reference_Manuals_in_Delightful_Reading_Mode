<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-udev-settle.service - Wait for all pending udev events to be
handled</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-udev-settle.service</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This service calls <strong>udevadm settle</strong> to wait until all
events that have been queued by <strong>udev</strong>(7) have been
processed. It is a crude way to wait until "all" hardware has been
discovered. Services may pull in this service and order themselves after
it to wait for the udev queue to be empty.</p>
<p><em>Using this service is not recommended.</em> There can be no
guarantee that hardware is fully discovered at any specific time,
because the kernel does hardware detection asynchronously, and certain
buses and devices take a very long time to become ready, and also
additional hardware may be plugged in at any time. Instead, services
should subscribe to udev events and react to any new hardware as it is
discovered. Services that, based on configuration, expect certain
devices to appear, may warn or report failure after a timeout. This
timeout should be tailored to the hardware type. Waiting for
systemd-udev-settle.service usually slows boot significantly, because it
means waiting for all unrelated events too.</p>
