<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-suspend.service, systemd-hibernate.service,
systemd-hybrid-sleep.service, systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service,
systemd-sleep - System sleep state logic</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-suspend.service</p>
<p>systemd-hibernate.service</p>
<p>systemd-hybrid-sleep.service</p>
<p>systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/system-sleep</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-suspend.service is a system service that is pulled in by
suspend.target and is responsible for the actual system suspend.
Similarly, systemd-hibernate.service is pulled in by hibernate.target to
execute the actual hibernation. Finally, systemd-hybrid-sleep.service is
pulled in by hybrid-sleep.target to execute hybrid hibernation with
system suspend and pulled in by suspend-then-hibernate.target to execute
system suspend with a timeout that will activate hibernate later.</p>
<p>Immediately before entering system suspend and/or hibernation
systemd-suspend.service (and the other mentioned units, respectively)
will run all executables in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ and pass two
arguments to them. The first argument will be "pre", the second either
"suspend", "hibernate", "hybrid-sleep", or "suspend-then-hibernate"
depending on the chosen action. An environment variable called
"SYSTEMD_SLEEP_ACTION" will be set and contain the sleep action that is
processing. This is primarily helpful for "suspend-then-hibernate" where
the value of the variable will be "suspend", "hibernate", or
"suspend-after-failed-hibernate" in cases where hibernation has failed.
Immediately after leaving system suspend and/or hibernation the same
executables are run, but the first argument is now "post". All
executables in this directory are executed in parallel, and execution of
the action is not continued until all executables have finished.</p>
<p>Note that scripts or binaries dropped in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/
are intended for local use only and should be considered hacks. If
applications want to react to system suspend/hibernation and resume,
they should rather use the <strong>Inhibitor interface</strong>[1].</p>
<p>Note that systemd-suspend.service, systemd-hibernate.service,
systemd-hybrid-sleep.service, and systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service
should never be executed directly. Instead, trigger system sleep with a
command such as <strong>systemctl suspend</strong> or <strong>systemctl
hibernate</strong>.</p>
<p>Internally, this service will echo a string like "mem" into
/sys/power/state, to trigger the actual system suspend. What exactly is
written where can be configured in the [Sleep] section of
/etc/systemd/sleep.conf or a sleep.conf.d file. See
<strong>systemd-sleep.conf</strong>(5).</p>
