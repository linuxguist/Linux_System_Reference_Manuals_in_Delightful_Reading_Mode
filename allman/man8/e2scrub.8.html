<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>e2scrub - check the contents of a mounted ext[234] file system</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>e2scrub [OPTION] MOUNTPOINT | DEVICE</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>e2scrub</strong> attempts to check (but not repair) all
metadata in a mounted ext[234] file system if the file system resides on
an LVM logical volume. The block device of the LVM logical volume can
also be passed in.</p>
<p>This program snapshots the volume and runs a file system check on the
snapshot to look for corruption errors. The LVM volume group must have
at least 256MiB of unallocated space to dedicate to the snapshot or the
logical volume will be skipped. The snapshot will be named
<em>lvname</em>.e2scrub and <strong>udev</strong> will not create
symbolic links to it under <em>/dev/disk</em>. Every attempt will be
made to remove the snapshots prior to running <strong>e2scrub</strong>,
but in a dire situation it may be necessary to remove the snapshot
manually.</p>
<p>If no errors are found, <strong>fstrim</strong> can be called on the
file system if it is mounted. If errors are found, the file system will
be marked as having errors. The file system should be taken offline and
<strong>e2fsck</strong> run as soon as possible, because
<strong>e2scrub</strong> does not fix corruptions. If the file system is
not repaired, <strong>e2fsck</strong> will be run before the next
mount.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-n</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print what commands <strong>e2scrub</strong> would execute to check
the file system. (Note: the commands will not actually be executed;
however, since <strong>e2scrub</strong> needs to run some commands to
query the system to determine what commands would be executed, it still
needs to be run as root.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-r</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove the e2scrub snapshot and exit without checking anything.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-t</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run <strong>fstrim(1)</strong> on the mounted file system if no
errors are found.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print version information and exit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXIT CODE</h1>
<p>The exit codes are the same as in <strong>e2fsck</strong>(8)</p>
