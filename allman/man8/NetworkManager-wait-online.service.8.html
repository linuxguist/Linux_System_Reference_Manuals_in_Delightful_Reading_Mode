<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>NetworkManager-wait-online.service - Wait for the network to come
online</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The NetworkManager-wait-online service is a oneshot systemd service
that delays reaching the network-online target until NetworkManager
reports that the startup is completed on the D-Bus.</p>
<p>When the system boots, for example, remote mounts defined in
/etc/fstab, require that the network is up. For this, these systemd
units contain the After=network-online.target setting to order
themselves after this target. NetworkManager-wait-online ensures that
the network-online target is reached only after the network is
available.</p>
<p>Optimally, all services on the host react dynamically to network
changes and systemd services do not need to be configured to start after
reaching the network-online target. In this case,
NetworkManager-wait-online.service has no effect and does not delay the
boot time. On the other hand, if you encounter a long boot time due to
the delay of NetworkManager-wait-online, investigate the services that
require network access and fix them.</p>
<p>Except for the time out value in the
NetworkManager-wait-online.service unit, you cannot configure this
service. Instead, settings in NetworkManager and the connection profiles
affect the behavior:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Startup is not complete as long as NetworkManager profiles are in an
activating state. During boot, NetworkManager starts profiles with the
connection.autoconnect=yes setting. If activation fails, NetworkManager
retries the activation depending on the value of the
connection.autoconnect-retries setting.</p>
<p>NetworkManager reports startup complete when all profiles and devices
are either activated or in a disconnect state and no further events are
expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>When a device reaches the activate state depends on its
configuration. For example, with a profile that has both IPv4 and IPv6
enabled, by default, NetworkManager considers the device as fully
activated already when only one of the address families is ready.</p>
<p>The ipv4.may-fail and ipv6.may-fail settings control this behavior.
Additionally, the following settings influence when the two address
families complete: ipv4.required-timeout, ipv6.required-timeout,
ipv4.dhcp-timeout, and ipv6.ra-timeout. For details, see
<strong>nm-settings-nmcli</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>NetworkManager cannot set IP addresses on bridge and bond devices
that have ports that do not auto-activate. Because of this configuration
error, NetworkManager-wait-online blocks until the service reaches its
timeout value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Dispatcher scripts for the pre-up event run at a late stage during
activation of a profile. These scripts block the activation for when
NetworkManager considers the profile fully activated. For details, see
<strong>NetworkManager-dispatcher</strong>(8).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The property connection.wait-activation-delay adds an additional
delay during activation and delays startup complete. This setting works
around certain cases where a device is known to not be ready for a
certain amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The property connection.wait-device-timeout in the connection
profiles cause a delay until the waiting devices appear. This is useful
if the driver takes a longer time to detect the networking interfaces.
This setting is similar to the connection.gateway-ping-timeout
property.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>With Wi-Fi devices, NetworkManager needs to wait for the first scan
result to know which networks are available. That adds a delay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>With Ethernet devices, NetworkManager waits for the carrier until the
value in [device*].carrier-wait-timeout is reached. This is because some
devices take a long time to detect the carrier. Consequently, booting
with cable unplugged, unnecessarily delays
NetworkManager-wait-online.service.</p>
