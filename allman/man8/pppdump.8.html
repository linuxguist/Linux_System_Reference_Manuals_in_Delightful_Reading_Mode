<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pppdump - convert PPP record file to readable format</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pppdump</strong> [ <strong>-h</strong> | <strong>-p</strong>
[ <strong>-d</strong> ]] [ <strong>-r</strong> ] [ <strong>-a</strong> ]
[ <strong>-m <em>mru</em></strong> ] [ <em>file ...</em> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>pppdump</strong> utility converts the files written using
the <em>record</em> option of <strong>pppd</strong> into a
human-readable format. If one or more filenames are specified,
<strong>pppdump</strong> will read each in turn; otherwise it will read
its standard input. In each case the result is written to standard
output.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-h</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the bytes sent and received in hexadecimal. If neither this
option nor the <strong>-p</strong> option is specified, the bytes are
printed as the characters themselves, with non-printing and non-ASCII
characters printed as escape sequences.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-p</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Collects the bytes sent and received into PPP packets, interpreting
the async HDLC framing and escape characters and checking the FCS (frame
check sequence) of each packet. The packets are printed as hex values
and as characters (non-printable characters are printed as `.').</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>With the <strong>-p</strong> option, this option causes
<strong>pppdump</strong> to decompress packets which have been
compressed with the BSD-Compress or Deflate methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-r</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Reverses the direction indicators, so that `sent' is printed for
bytes or packets received, and `rcvd' is printed for bytes or packets
sent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-a</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints absolute times.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-m <em>mru</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use <em>mru</em> as the MRU (maximum receive unit) for both
directions of the link when checking for over-length PPP packets (with
the <strong>-p</strong> option).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
