<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-backlight@.service, systemd-backlight - Load and save the
display backlight brightness at boot and shutdown</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-backlight@.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight save [backlight|leds]:DEVICE</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight load [backlight|leds]:DEVICE</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-backlight@.service is a service that restores the display
backlight brightness at early boot and saves it at shutdown. On disk,
the backlight brightness is stored in /var/lib/systemd/backlight/.
During loading, if the udev property <strong>ID_BACKLIGHT_CLAMP</strong>
is not set to false, the brightness is clamped to a value of at least 1
or 5% of maximum brightness, whichever is greater. This restriction will
be removed when the kernel allows user space to reliably set a
brightness value which does not turn off the display.</p>
<h1>KERNEL COMMAND LINE</h1>
<p>systemd-backlight understands the following kernel command line
parameter:</p>
<p><em>systemd.restore_state=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. Defaults to "1". If "0", does not restore
the backlight settings on boot. However, settings will still be stored
on shutdown.</p>
</blockquote>
