<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>avahi-autoipd.action - avahi-autoipd action script</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>/etc/avahi/avahi-autoipd.action</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>avahi-autoipd.action</em> is the action script that is called
whenever an IP address has been acquired by avahi-autoipd or when it
detected an IP address conflict. The script should add or remove the
specified address from the specified network interface.</p>
<h1>PARAMETERS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>argv[1]</strong> An event string: one of BIND, CONFLICT,
UNBIND or STOP. If BIND is passed an IP address has been successfully
acquired and the script shall add it to the network interface. If
CONFLICT is passed avahi-autopid detected a IP address on the local
network, the action script should remove the configured IP address. If
UNBIND is passed the IP address should be removed from the interface,
too, because a routable address has been configured to the interface by
some other program. If STOP is passed the avahi-autoipd is being
shutdown and the action script should remove the IP address. In short:
on BIND the address should be added to the interface, on CONFLICT,
UNBIND or STOP it should be removed. </dt>

<dl>
<dt><strong>argv[2]</strong> The network interface name.</dt>
<dd>
