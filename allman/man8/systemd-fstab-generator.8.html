<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-fstab-generator - Unit generator for /etc/fstab</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-fstab-generator is a generator that translates /etc/fstab
(see <strong>fstab</strong>(5) for details) into native systemd units
early at boot and when configuration of the system manager is reloaded.
This will instantiate mount and swap units as necessary.</p>
<p>The <em>passno</em> field is treated like a simple boolean, and the
ordering information is discarded. However, if the root file system is
checked, it is checked before all the other file systems.</p>
<p>See <strong>systemd.mount</strong>(5) and
<strong>systemd.swap</strong>(5) for more information about special
/etc/fstab mount options this generator understands.</p>
<p>One special topic is handling of symbolic links. Historical init
implementations supported symlinks in /etc/fstab. Because mount units
will refuse mounts where the target is a symbolic link, this generator
will resolve any symlinks as far as possible when processing /etc/fstab
in order to enhance backwards compatibility. If a symlink target does
not exist at the time that this generator runs, it is assumed that the
symlink target is the final target of the mount.</p>
<p>systemd-fstab-generator implements
<strong>systemd.generator</strong>(7).</p>
<h1>KERNEL COMMAND LINE</h1>
<p>systemd-fstab-generator understands the following kernel command line
parameters:</p>
<p><em>fstab=</em>, <em>rd.fstab=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. Defaults to "yes". If "no", causes the
generator to ignore any mounts or swap devices configured in /etc/fstab.
<em>rd.fstab=</em> is honored only in the initrd, while <em>fstab=</em>
is honored by both the main system and the initrd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>root=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the operating systems root filesystem to mount when
running in the initrd. This accepts a device node path (usually
/dev/disk/by-uuid/... or /dev/disk/by-label/... or similar), or the
special values "gpt-auto" and "tmpfs".</p>
<p>Use "gpt-auto" to explicitly request automatic root file system
discovery via <strong>systemd-gpt-auto-generator</strong>(8).</p>
<p>Use "tmpfs" in order to mount a <strong>tmpfs</strong>(5) file system
as root file system of the OS. This is useful in combination with
<em>mount.usr=</em> (see below) in order to combine a volatile root file
system with a separate, immutable /usr/ file system. Also see
<em>systemd.volatile=</em> below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>rootfstype=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the root filesystem type that will be passed to the mount
command. <em>rootfstype=</em> is honored by the initrd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>rootflags=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the root filesystem mount options to use. <em>rootflags=</em>
is honored by the initrd.</p>
<p>Note that unlike most kernel command line options this setting does
not override settings made in configuration files (specifically: the
mount option string in /etc/fstab). See
<strong>systemd-remount-fs.service</strong>(8).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>mount.usr=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the /usr/ filesystem to be mounted by the initrd. If
<em>mount.usrfstype=</em> or <em>mount.usrflags=</em> is set, then
<em>mount.usr=</em> will default to the value set in <em>root=</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this parameter defaults to the /usr/ entry found in
/etc/fstab on the root filesystem.</p>
<p><em>mount.usr=</em> is honored by the initrd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>mount.usrfstype=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the /usr/ filesystem type that will be passed to the mount
command. If <em>mount.usr=</em> or <em>mount.usrflags=</em> is set, then
<em>mount.usrfstype=</em> will default to the value set in
<em>rootfstype=</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this value will be read from the /usr/ entry in /etc/fstab
on the root filesystem.</p>
<p><em>mount.usrfstype=</em> is honored by the initrd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>mount.usrflags=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the /usr/ filesystem mount options to use. If
<em>mount.usr=</em> or <em>mount.usrfstype=</em> is set, then
<em>mount.usrflags=</em> will default to the value set in
<em>rootflags=</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this value will be read from the /usr/ entry in /etc/fstab
on the root filesystem.</p>
<p><em>mount.usrflags=</em> is honored by the initrd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>roothash=</em>, <em>usrhash=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These options are primarily read by
<strong>systemd-veritysetup-generator</strong>(8). When set this
indicates that the root file system (or /usr/) shall be mounted from
Verity volumes with the specified hashes. If these kernel command line
options are set the root (or /usr/) file system is thus mounted from a
device mapper volume /dev/mapper/root (or /dev/mapper/usr).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>systemd.volatile=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls whether the system shall boot up in volatile mode. Takes a
boolean argument or the special value <strong>state</strong>.</p>
<p>If false (the default), this generator makes no changes to the mount
tree and the system is booted up in normal mode.</p>
<p>If true the generator ensures
<strong>systemd-volatile-root.service</strong>(8) is run in the initrd.
This service changes the mount table before transitioning to the host
system, so that a volatile memory file system ("tmpfs") is used as root
directory, with only /usr/ mounted into it from the configured root file
system, in read-only mode. This way the system operates in fully
stateless mode, with all configuration and state reset at boot and lost
at shutdown, as /etc/ and /var/ will be served from the (initially
unpopulated) volatile memory file system.</p>
<p>If set to <strong>state</strong> the generator will leave the root
directory mount point unaltered, however will mount a "tmpfs" file
system to /var/. In this mode the normal system configuration (i.e. the
contents of "/etc/") is in effect (and may be modified during system
runtime), however the system state (i.e. the contents of "/var/") is
reset at boot and lost at shutdown.</p>
<p>If this setting is set to "overlay" the root file system is set up as
"overlayfs" mount combining the read-only root directory with a writable
"tmpfs", so that no modifications are made to disk, but the file system
may be modified nonetheless with all changes being lost at reboot.</p>
<p>Note that in none of these modes the root directory, /etc/, /var/ or
any other resources stored in the root file system are physically
removed. Its thus safe to boot a system that is normally operated in
non-volatile mode temporarily into volatile mode, without losing
data.</p>
<p>Note that with the exception of "overlay" mode, enabling this setting
will only work correctly on operating systems that can boot up with only
/usr/ mounted, and are able to automatically populate /etc/, and also
/var/ in case of "systemd.volatile=yes".</p>
<p>Also see <em>root=tmpfs</em> above, for a method to combine a "tmpfs"
file system with a regular /usr/ file system (as configured via
<em>mount.usr=</em>). The main distinction between
<em>systemd.volatile=yes</em>, and <em>root=tmpfs</em> in combination
<em>mount.usr=</em> is that the former operates on top of a regular root
file system and temporarily obstructs the files and directories above
its /usr/ subdirectory, while the latter does not hide any files, but
simply mounts a unpopulated tmpfs as root file system and combines it
with a user picked /usr/ file system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>systemd.swap=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without
an argument. If disabled, causes the generator to ignore any swap
devices configured in /etc/fstab. Defaults to enabled.</p>
