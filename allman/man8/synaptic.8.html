<h1>AUTHORS</h1>
<p>Synaptic was originally developed by Alfredo K. Kojima
&lt;kojima@conectiva.com.br&gt;. His last official release was 0.16.
Michael Vogt &lt;mvo@debian.org&gt; took over his CVS version, that
already included a nearly complete port to Gtk+. Michael completed the
port and added new features. See the <em>NEWS</em> file for the user
visible changes from that point on. Conectiva is still involved in the
development of synaptic. Gustavo Niemeyer &lt;niemeyer@conectiva.com&gt;
is doing a great deal of work.</p>
<p>All development is done at
