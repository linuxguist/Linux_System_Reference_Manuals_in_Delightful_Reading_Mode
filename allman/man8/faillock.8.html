<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>faillock - Tool for displaying and modifying the authentication
failure record files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>faillock</strong> [--dir <em>/path/to/tally-directory</em>]
[--user <em>username</em>] [--reset]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>pam_faillock.so</em> module maintains a list of failed
authentication attempts per user during a specified interval and locks
the account in case there were more than <em>deny</em> consecutive
failed authentications. It stores the failure records into per-user
files in the tally directory.</p>
<p>The <strong>faillock</strong> command is an application which can be
used to examine and modify the contents of the tally files. It can
display the recent failed authentication attempts of the
<em>username</em> or clear the tally files of all or individual
<em>usernames</em>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>--user</strong> <em>username</em></p>
<blockquote>
