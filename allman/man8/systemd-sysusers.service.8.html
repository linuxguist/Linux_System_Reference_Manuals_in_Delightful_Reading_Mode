<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-sysusers, systemd-sysusers.service - Allocate system users
and groups</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-sysusers</strong> [OPTIONS...]
[<em>CONFIGFILE</em>...]</p>
<p>systemd-sysusers.service</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-sysusers</strong> creates system users and groups,
based on files in the format described in
<strong>sysusers.d</strong>(5).</p>
<p>If invoked with no arguments, it applies all directives from all
files found in the directories specified by
<strong>sysusers.d</strong>(5). When invoked with positional arguments,
if option <strong>--replace=</strong><em>PATH</em> is specified,
arguments specified on the command line are used instead of the
configuration file <em>PATH</em>. Otherwise, just the configuration
specified by the command line arguments is executed. The string "-" may
be specified instead of a filename to instruct
<strong>systemd-sysusers</strong> to read the configuration from
standard input. If the argument is a relative path, all configuration
directories are searched for a matching file and the file found that has
the highest priority is executed. If the argument is an absolute path,
that file is used directly without searching of the configuration
directories.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p><strong>--root=</strong><em>root</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be prefixed
with the given alternate <em>root</em> path, including config search
paths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--image=</strong><em>image</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If specified
all operations are applied to file system in the indicated disk image.
This is similar to <strong>--root=</strong> but operates on file systems
stored in disk images or block devices. The disk image should either
contain just a file system or a set of file systems within a GPT
partition table, following the <strong>Discoverable Partitions
Specification</strong>[1]. For further information on supported disk
images, see <strong>systemd-nspawn</strong>(1)s switch of the same
name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--replace=</strong><em>PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this option is given, one or more positional arguments must be
specified. All configuration files found in the directories listed in
<strong>sysusers.d</strong>(5) will be read, and the configuration given
on the command line will be handled instead of and with the same
priority as the configuration file <em>PATH</em>.</p>
<p>This option is intended to be used when package installation scripts
are running and files belonging to that package are not yet available on
disk, so their contents must be given on the command line, but the admin
configuration might already exist and should be given higher
priority.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1. RPM installation script for radvd</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>echo u radvd - &quot;radvd daemon&quot; | \
          systemd-sysusers --replace=/usr/lib/sysusers.d/radvd.conf -</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will create the radvd user as if /usr/lib/sysusers.d/radvd.conf
was already on disk. An admin might override the configuration specified
on the command line by placing /etc/sysusers.d/radvd.conf or even
/etc/sysusers.d/00-overrides.conf.</p>
<p>Note that this is the expanded form, and when used in a package, this
would be written using a macro with "radvd" and a file containing the
configuration line as arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--dry-run</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Process the configuration and figure out what entries would be
created, but dont actually write anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--inline</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treat each positional argument as a separate configuration line
instead of a file name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--cat-config</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copy the contents of config files to standard output. Before each
file, the filename is printed as a comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>CREDENTIALS</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-sysusers</strong> supports the service credentials
logic as implemented by <em>LoadCredential=</em>/<em>SetCredential=</em>
(see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(1) for details). The following
credentials are used when passed in:</p>
<p>"passwd.hashed-password.<em>user</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A UNIX hashed password string to use for the specified user, when
creating an entry for it. This is particularly useful for the "root"
user as it allows provisioning the default root password to use via a
unit file drop-in or from a container manager passing in this
credential. Note that setting this credential has no effect if the
specified user account already exists. This credential is hence
primarily useful in first boot scenarios or systems that are fully
stateless and come up with an empty /etc/ on every boot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"passwd.plaintext-password.<em>user</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to "passwd.hashed-password.<em>user</em>" but expect a
literal, plaintext password, which is then automatically hashed before
used for the user account. If both the hashed and the plaintext
credential are specified for the same user the former takes precedence.
Its generally recommended to specify the hashed version; however in test
environments with weaker requirements on security it might be easier to
pass passwords in plaintext instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"passwd.shell.<em>user</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the shell binary to use for the specified account when
creating it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"sysusers.extra"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contents of this credential may contain additional lines to
operate on. The credential contents should follow the same format as any
other sysusers.d/ drop-in. If this credential is passed it is processed
after all of the drop-in files read from the file system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that by default the systemd-sysusers.service unit file is set up
to inherit the "passwd.hashed-password.root",
"passwd.plaintext-password.root", "passwd.shell.root" and
"sysusers.extra" credentials from the service manager. Thus, when
invoking a container with an unpopulated /etc/ for the first time it is
possible to configure the root users password to be "systemd" like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># systemd-nspawn --image=... --set-credential=passwd.hashed-password.root:$y$j9T$yAuRJu1o5HioZAGDYPU5d.$F64ni6J2y2nNQve90M/p0ZP0ECP/qqzipNyaY9fjGpC ...</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note again that the data specified in this credential is consulted
only when creating an account for the first time, it may not be used for
changing the password or shell of an account that already exists.</p>
<p>Use <strong>mkpasswd</strong>(1) for generating UNIX password hashes
from the command line.</p>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.</p>
