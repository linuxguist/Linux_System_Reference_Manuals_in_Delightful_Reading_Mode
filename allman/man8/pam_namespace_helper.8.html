<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pam_namespace_helper - Helper binary that creates home
directories</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pam_namespace_helper</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>pam_namespace_helper</em> is a helper program for the
<em>pam_namespace</em> module that sets up a private namespace for a
session with polyinstantiated directories. The helper ensures that the
namespace mount points exist before they are started to be used for the
polyinstantiated directories. Mount points for home directories (lines
with $HOME) are not created.</p>
<p><em>pam_namespace_helper</em> should be run by systemd at system
startup. It should also be run by the administrator after defining the
polyinstantiated directories but before enabling them.</p>
