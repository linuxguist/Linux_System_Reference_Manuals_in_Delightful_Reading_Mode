<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-quotacheck.service, systemd-quotacheck - File system quota
checker logic</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-quotacheck.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-quotacheck</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-quotacheck.service is a service responsible for file system
quota checks. It is run once at boot after all necessary file systems
are mounted. It is pulled in only if at least one file system has quotas
enabled.</p>
<h1>KERNEL COMMAND LINE</h1>
<p>systemd-quotacheck understands one kernel command line parameter:</p>
<p><em>quotacheck.mode=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of "auto", "force", "skip". Controls the mode of operation. The
default is "auto", and ensures that file system quota checks are done
when the file system quota checker deems them necessary. "force"
unconditionally results in full file system quota checks. "skip" skips
any file system quota checks.</p>
