<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pppstats - print PPP statistics</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pppstats</strong> [ <strong>-a</strong> ] [
<strong>-d</strong> ] [ <strong>-v</strong> ] [ <strong>-r</strong> ] [
<strong>-z</strong> ] [ <strong>-c</strong> <em>&lt;count&gt;</em> ] [
<strong>-w</strong> <em>&lt;secs&gt;</em> ] [ <em>interface</em> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>pppstats</strong> utility reports PPP-related statistics
at regular intervals for the specified PPP interface. If the interface
is unspecified, it will default to ppp0. The display is split
horizontally into input and output sections containing columns of
statistics describing the properties and volume of packets received and
transmitted by the interface.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-a</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display absolute values rather than deltas. With this option, all
reports show statistics for the time since the link was initiated.
Without this option, the second and subsequent reports show statistics
for the time since the last report.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Show data rate (kB/s) instead of bytes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-c <em>count</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Repeat the display <em>count</em> times. If this option is not
specified, the default repeat count is 1 if the <strong>-w</strong>
option is not specified, otherwise infinity.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-r</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display additional statistics summarizing the compression ratio
achieved by the packet compression algorithm in use.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display additional statistics relating to the performance of the Van
Jacobson TCP header compression algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-w <em>wait</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Pause <em>wait</em> seconds between each display. If this option is
not specified, the default interval is 5 seconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-z</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Instead of the standard display, show statistics indicating the
performance of the packet compression algorithm in use.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following fields are printed on the input side when the
<strong>-z</strong> option is not used:</p>
<dl>

<p>The total number of bytes received by this interface.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong>VJCOMP</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of header-compressed TCP packets received by this
interface.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>VJUNC</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of header-uncompressed TCP packets received by this
interface. Not reported when the <strong>-r</strong> option is
specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>VJERR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of corrupted or bogus header-compressed TCP packets
received by this interface. Not reported when the <strong>-r</strong>
option is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>VJTOSS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of VJ header-compressed TCP packets dropped on reception
by this interface because of preceding errors. Only reported when the
<strong>-v</strong> option is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NON-VJ</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The total number of non-TCP packets received by this interface. Only
reported when the <strong>-v</strong> option is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>RATIO</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The compression ratio achieved for received packets by the packet
compression scheme in use, defined as the uncompressed size divided by
the compressed size. Only reported when the <strong>-r</strong> option
is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>UBYTE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The total number of bytes received, after decompression of compressed
packets. Only reported when the <strong>-r</strong> option is
specified.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following fields are printed on the output side:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>OUT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The total number of bytes transmitted from this interface.</p>

Not reported when the <strong>-r</strong> option is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>VJSRCH</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of searches for the cached header entry for a VJ header
compressed TCP packet. Only reported when the <strong>-v</strong> option
is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>VJMISS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of failed searches for the cached header entry for a VJ
header compressed TCP packet. Only reported when the <strong>-v</strong>
option is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>RATIO</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The compression ratio achieved for transmitted packets by the packet
compression scheme in use, defined as the size before compression
divided by the compressed size. Only reported when the
<strong>-r</strong> option is specified.</p>

option is specified.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the <strong>-z</strong> option is specified,
<strong>pppstats</strong> instead displays the following fields,
relating to the packet compression algorithm currently in use. If packet
compression is not in use, these fields will all display zeroes. The
