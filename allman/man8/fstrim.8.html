<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>fstrim - discard unused blocks on a mounted filesystem</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>fstrim</strong> [<strong>-Aa</strong>] [<strong>-o</strong>
<em>offset</em>] [<strong>-l</strong> <em>length</em>]
[<strong>-m</strong> <em>minimum-size</em>] [<strong>-v</strong>
<em>mountpoint</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>fstrim</strong> is used on a mounted filesystem to discard
(or "trim") blocks which are not in use by the filesystem. This is
useful for solid-state drives (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.</p>
<p>By default, <strong>fstrim</strong> will discard all unused blocks in
the filesystem. Options may be used to modify this behavior based on
range or size, as explained below.</p>
<p>The <em>mountpoint</em> argument is the pathname of the directory
where the filesystem is mounted.</p>
<p>Running <strong>fstrim</strong> frequently, or even using
<strong>mount -o discard</strong>, might negatively affect the lifetime
of poor-quality SSD devices. For most desktop and server systems a
sufficient trimming frequency is once a week. Note that not all devices
support a queued trim, so each trim command incurs a performance penalty
on whatever else might be trying to use the disk at the time.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The <em>offset</em>, <em>length</em>, and <em>minimum-size</em>
arguments may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024),
MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the
"iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the
suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB
and YB.</p>
<p><strong>-A, --fstab</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trim all mounted filesystems mentioned in <em>/etc/fstab</em> on
devices that support the discard operation. The root filesystem is
determined from kernel command line if missing in the file. The other
supplied options, like <strong>--offset</strong>,
<strong>--length</strong> and <strong>--minimum</strong>, are applied to
all these devices. Errors from filesystems that do not support the
discard operation, read-only devices, autofs and read-only filesystems
are silently ignored. Filesystems with "X-fstrim.notrim" mount option
are skipped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-a, --all</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trim all mounted filesystems on devices that support the discard
operation. The other supplied options, like <strong>--offset</strong>,
<strong>--length</strong> and <strong>--minimum</strong>, are applied to
all these devices. Errors from filesystems that do not support the
discard operation, read-only devices and read-only filesystems are
silently ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-n, --dry-run</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option does everything apart from actually call
<strong>FITRIM</strong> ioctl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-o, --offset</strong> <em>offset</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Byte offset in the filesystem from which to begin searching for free
blocks to discard. The default value is zero, starting at the beginning
of the filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-l, --length</strong> <em>length</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of bytes (after the starting point) to search for free
blocks to discard. If the specified value extends past the end of the
filesystem, <strong>fstrim</strong> will stop at the filesystem size
boundary. The default value extends to the end of the filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-I, --listed-in</strong> <em>list</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a colon-separated list of files in fstab or kernel
mountinfo format. All missing or empty files are silently ignored. The
evaluation of the <em>list</em> stops after first non-empty file. For
example:</p>
<p><strong>--listed-in /etc/fstab:/proc/self/mountinfo</strong>.</p>
<p>Filesystems with "X-fstrim.notrim" mount option in fstab are
skipped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-m, --minimum</strong> <em>minimum-size</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimum contiguous free range to discard, in bytes. (This value is
internally rounded up to a multiple of the filesystem block size.) Free
ranges smaller than this will be ignored and <strong>fstrim</strong>
will adjust the minimum if it’s smaller than the device’s minimum, and
report that (fstrim_range.minlen) back to userspace. By increasing this
value, the <strong>fstrim</strong> operation will complete more quickly
for filesystems with badly fragmented freespace, although not all blocks
will be discarded. The default value is zero, discarding every free
block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-v, --verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Verbose execution. With this option <strong>fstrim</strong> will
output the number of bytes passed from the filesystem down the block
stack to the device for potential discard. This number is a maximum
discard amount from the storage device’s perspective, because
<em>FITRIM</em> ioctl called repeated will keep sending the same sectors
for discard repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>fstrim</strong> will report the same potential discard bytes
each time, but only sectors which had been written to between the
discards would actually be discarded by the storage device. Further, the
kernel block layer reserves the right to adjust the discard ranges to
fit raid stripe geometry, non-trim capable devices in a LVM setup, etc.
These reductions would not be reflected in fstrim_range.len (the
<strong>--length</strong> option).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--quiet-unsupported</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress error messages if trim operation (ioctl) is unsupported.
This option is meant to be used in <strong>systemd</strong> service file
or in <strong>cron</strong>(8) scripts to hide warnings that are result
of known problems, such as NTFS driver reporting <em>Bad file
descriptor</em> when device is mounted read-only, or lack of file system
support for ioctl <em>FITRIM</em> call. This option also cleans exit
status when unsupported filesystem specified on <strong>fstrim</strong>
command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print version and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>0</p>
<blockquote>
<p>success</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>failure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>32</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all failed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>64</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some filesystem discards have succeeded, some failed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The command <strong>fstrim --all</strong> returns 0 (all succeeded),
32 (all failed) or 64 (some failed, some succeeded).</p>
