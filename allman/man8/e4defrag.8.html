<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>e4defrag - online defragmenter for ext4 file system</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>e4defrag</strong> [ <strong>-c</strong> ] [
<strong>-v</strong> ] <em>target</em> ...</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>e4defrag</strong> reduces fragmentation of extent based file.
The file targeted by <strong>e4defrag</strong> is created on ext4 file
system made with "-O extent" option (see <strong>mke2fs</strong>(8)).
The targeted file gets more contiguous blocks and improves the file
access speed.</p>
<p><em>target</em> is a regular file, a directory, or a device that is
mounted as ext4 file system. If <em>target</em> is a directory,
<strong>e4defrag</strong> reduces fragmentation of all files in it. If
<em>target</em> is a device, <strong>e4defrag</strong> gets the mount
point of it and reduces fragmentation of all files in this mount
point.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-c</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Get a current fragmentation count and an ideal fragmentation count,
and calculate fragmentation score based on them. By seeing this score,
we can determine whether we should execute <strong>e4defrag</strong> to
<em>target</em>. When used with <strong>-v</strong> option, the current
fragmentation count and the ideal fragmentation count are printed for
each file.</p>
<p>Also this option outputs the average data size in one extent. If you
see it, you'll find the file has ideal extents or not. Note that the
maximum extent size is 131072KB in ext4 file system (if block size is
4KB).</p>
<p>If this option is specified, <em>target</em> is never
defragmented.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print error messages and the fragmentation count before and after
defrag for each file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p><strong>e4defrag</strong> does not support swap file, files in
lost+found directory, and files allocated in indirect blocks. When
<em>target</em> is a device or a mount point, <strong>e4defrag</strong>
doesn't defragment files in mount point of other device.</p>
<p>It is safe to run e4defrag on a file while it is actively in use by
another application. Since the contents of file blocks are copied using
the page cache, this can result in a performance slowdown to both
e4defrag and the application due to contention over the system's memory
and disk bandwidth.</p>
<p>If the file system's free space is fragmented, or if there is
insufficient free space available, e4defrag may not be able to improve
the file's fragmentation.</p>
<p>Non-privileged users can execute <strong>e4defrag</strong> to their
own file, but the score is not printed if <strong>-c</strong> option is
specified. Therefore, it is desirable to be executed by root user.</p>
