<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> and <strong>addgroup</strong> add users and
groups to the system according to command line options and configuration
information in <em>/etc/adduser.conf</em>. They are friendlier front
ends to the low level tools like <strong>useradd</strong>,
<strong>groupadd</strong> and <strong>usermod</strong> programs, by
default choosing Debian policy conformant UID and GID values, creating a
home directory with skeletal configuration, running a custom script, and
other features.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> and <strong>addgroup</strong> are intended
as a policy layer, making it easier for package maintainers and local
administrators to create local system accounts in the way Debian expects
them to be created, taking the burden to adapt to the probably changing
specifications of Debian policy. <strong>adduser --system</strong> takes
special attention on just needing a single call in the package
maintainer scripts without any conditional wrappers, error suppression
or other scaffolding.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> honors the distinction between
<em>dynamically allocated system users and groups</em> and
<em>dynamically allocated user accounts</em> that is documented in
Debian Policy, Chapter 9.2.2.</p>
<p>For a full list and explanations of all options, see the OPTIONS
section.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> and <strong>addgroup</strong> can be run in
one of five modes:</p>
<h2>Add a normal user</h2>
<p>If called with one non-option argument and without the
<strong>--system</strong> or <strong>--group</strong> options,
<strong>adduser</strong> will add a normal user, that means a
<em>dynamically allocated user account</em> in the sense of Debian
Policy. This is commonly referred to in <strong>adduser</strong> as a
<em>non-system user.</em></p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> will choose the first available UID from the
range specified by <strong>FIRST_UID</strong> and
<strong>LAST_UID</strong> in the configuration file. The range may be
overridden with the <strong>--firstuid</strong> and
<strong>--lastuid</strong> options. Finally, the UID can be set fully
manually with the <strong>--uid</strong> option.</p>
<p>By default, each user is given a corresponding group with the same
name. This is commonly called <em>Usergroups</em> and allows group
writable directories to be easily maintained by placing the appropriate
users in the new group, setting the set-group-ID bit in the directory,
and ensuring that all users use a umask of 002.</p>
<p>For a usergroup, <strong>adduser</strong> will choose the first
available GID from the range specified by <strong>FIRST_GID</strong> and
<strong>LAST_GID</strong> in the configuration file. The range may be
overridden with the <strong>--firstgid</strong> and
<strong>--lastgid</strong> options. Finally, the GID can be set fully
manually with the <strong>--gid</strong> option.</p>
<p>The interaction between <strong>USERS_GID</strong>,
<strong>USERS_GROUP</strong>, and <strong>USERGROUPS</strong> is
explained in detail in <strong>adduser.conf</strong>(5).</p>
<p>Users' primary groups can also be overridden from the command line
with the <strong>--gid</strong> or <strong>--ingroup</strong> options to
set the group by id or name, respectively. Also, users can be added to
one or more supplemental groups defined as <strong>EXTRA_GROUPS</strong>
in the configuration file either by setting
<strong>ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS</strong> to 1 in the configuration file, or by
passing <strong>--add-extra-groups</strong> on the command line.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> will copy files from <em>/etc/skel</em> into
the home directory and prompt for the comment field and a password if
those functions have not been turned off / overridden from the command
line.</p>
<p>UID, comment, home directory and shell might be pre-determined with
the <strong>UID_POOL</strong> and <strong>GID_POOL</strong> option,
documented in <strong>adduser.conf</strong>(5).</p>
<h2>Add a system user</h2>
<p>If called with one non-option argument and the
<strong>--system</strong> option, <strong>adduser</strong> will add a
<em>dynamically allocated system user,</em> often abbreviated as
<em>system user</em> in the context of the <strong>adduser</strong>
package.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> will choose the first available UID from the
range specified by <strong>FIRST_SYSTEM_UID</strong> and
<strong>LAST_SYSTEM_UID</strong> in the configuration file. This can be
overridden with the <strong>--uid</strong> option.</p>
<p>By default, system users are placed in the <strong>nogroup</strong>
group. To place the new system user in an already existing group, use
the <strong>--gid</strong> or <strong>--ingroup</strong> options. If the
<strong>--group</strong> is given and the identically named group does
not already exist, it is created with the same ID.</p>
<p>If no home directory is specified, the default home directory for a
new system user is <em>/nonexistent</em>. This directory should never
exist on any Debian system, and <strong>adduser</strong> will never
create it automatically.</p>
<p>Unless a shell is explicitly set with the <strong>--shell</strong>
option, the new system user will have the shell set to
<em>/usr/sbin/nologin</em>. <strong>adduser --system</strong> does not
set a password for the new account. Skeletal configuration files are not
copied.</p>
<p>Other options will behave as for the creation of a normal user. The
files referenced by <strong>UID_POOL</strong> and
<strong>GID_POOL</strong> do also work.</p>
<h2>Add a group</h2>
<p>If <strong>adduser</strong> is called with the
<strong>--group</strong> option and without the
<strong>--system</strong> option, or <strong>addgroup</strong> is called
respectively, a user group will be added.</p>
<p>A <em>dynamically allocated system group,</em> often abbreviated as
<em>system group</em> in the context of the <strong>adduser</strong>
package, will be created if <strong>adduser</strong> is called with the
<strong>--system</strong> option.</p>
<p>A GID will be chosen from the respective range specified for GIDs in
the configuration file (<strong>FIRST_GID</strong>,
<strong>LAST_GID</strong>, <strong>FIRST_SYSTEM_GID</strong>,
<strong>LAST_SYSTEM_GID</strong>). To override that mechanism, you can
give the GID using the <strong>--gid</strong> option.</p>
<p>For non-system groups, the range specified in the configuration file
may be overridden with the <strong>--firstgid</strong> and
<strong>--lastgid</strong> options.</p>
<p>The group is created with no members.</p>
<h2>Add an existing user to an existing group</h2>
<p>If called with two non-option arguments, <strong>adduser</strong>
will add an existing user to an existing group.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Different modes of <strong>adduser</strong> allow different options.
If no valid modes are listed for a option, it is accepted in all
modes.</p>
<p>Short versions for certain options may exist for historical reasons.
They are going to stay supported, but are removed from the
documentation. Users are advised to migrate to the long version of
options.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--add-extra-groups</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add new user to extra groups defined in the configuration files'
<strong>EXTRA_GROUPS</strong> setting. The old spelling
<strong>--add_extra_groups</strong> is deprecated and will be supported
in Debian bookworm only. Valid Modes: <strong>adduser</strong>,
<strong>adduser --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--allow-all-names</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Allow any user- and groupname which is supported by the underlying
<strong>useradd</strong>(8), including names containing non-ASCII
characters. See VALID NAMES in <strong>adduser.conf</strong>(5). Valid
Modes: <strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser --system</strong>,
<strong>addgroup</strong>, <strong>addgroup --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--allow-bad-names</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable <strong>NAME_REGEX</strong> and
<strong>SYS_NAME_REGEX</strong> check of names. Only a weaker check for
validity of the name is applied. See VALID NAMES in
<strong>adduser.conf</strong>(5). Valid Modes: <strong>adduser</strong>,
<strong>adduser --system</strong>, <strong>addgroup</strong>,
<strong>addgroup --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--comment</strong><em> comment </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the comment field for the new entry generated.
<strong>adduser</strong> will not ask for the information if this option
is given. This field is also known under the name GECOS field and
contains information that is used by the <strong>finger</strong>(1)
command. This used to be the <strong>--gecos</strong> option, which is
deprecated and will be removed after Debian bookworm. Valid Modes:
<strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--conf</strong><em> file </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use <em>file</em> instead of <em>/etc/adduser.conf</em>. Multiple
<strong>--conf</strong> options can be given.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--debug</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Activate debugging code.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--disabled-login</strong><br />
<strong>--disabled-password</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not run <strong>passwd</strong>(1) to set a password. In most
situations, logins are still possible though (for example using SSH keys
or through PAM) for reasons that are beyond <strong>adduser</strong>'s
scope. <strong>--disabled-login</strong> will additionally set the shell
to <em>/usr/sbin/nologin</em>. Valid Mode: <strong>adduser</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--firstuid</strong><em> ID </em><br />
<strong>--lastuid</strong><em> ID </em><br />
<strong>--firstgid</strong><em> ID </em><br />
<strong>--lastgid</strong><em> ID </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Override the first UID / last UID / first GID / last GID in the range
that the uid is chosen from (<strong>FIRST_UID</strong>,
<strong>LAST_UID</strong>, <strong>FIRST_GID</strong> and
<strong>LAST_GID</strong>, <strong>FIRST_SYSTEM_UID</strong>,
<strong>LAST_SYSTEM_UID</strong>, <strong>FIRST_SYSTEM_GID</strong> and
<strong>LAST_SYSTEM_GID</strong> in the configuration file). If a group
is created as a usergroup, <strong>--firstgid</strong> and
<strong>--lastgid</strong> are ignored. The group gets the same ID as
the user. Valid Modes: <strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser
--system</strong>, for <strong>--firstgid</strong> and
<strong>--lastgid</strong> also <strong>addgroup</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--force-badname</strong><br />
<strong>--allow-badname</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>These are the deprecated forms of <strong>--allow-bad-names</strong>.
It will be removed during the release cycle of the Debian release after
<em>bookworm</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--gid</strong><em> ID </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When creating a group, this option sets the group ID number of the
new group to <em>GID</em>. When creating a user, this option sets the
primary group ID number of the new user to <em>GID</em>. Valid Modes:
<strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser --system</strong>,
<strong>addgroup</strong>, <strong>addgroup --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--group</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Using this option in <strong>adduser --system</strong> indicates that
the new user should get an identically named group as its primary group.
If that identically named group is not already present, it is created.
If not combined with <strong>--system</strong>, a group with the given
name is created. The latter is the default action if the program is
invoked as <strong>addgroup</strong>. Valid Modes: <strong>adduser
--system</strong>, <strong>addgroup</strong>, <strong>addgroup
--system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display brief instructions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--home</strong><em> dir </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use <em>dir</em> as the user's home directory, rather than the
default specified by the configuration file (or <em>/nonexistent</em> if
<strong>adduser --system</strong> is used). If the directory does not
exist, it is created. Valid Modes: <strong>adduser</strong>,
<strong>adduser --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--ingroup</strong><em> GROUP </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When creating a user, this option sets the primary group ID number of
the new user to the GID of the named group. Unlike with the
<strong>--gid</strong> option, the group is specified here by name
rather than by numeric ID number. The group must already exist. Valid
Modes: <strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--lastuid</strong><em> ID </em><br />
<strong>--lastgid</strong><em> ID </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Override the last UID / last GID. See
<strong>--firstuid</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--no-create-home</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not create a home directory for the new user. Note that the
pathname for the new user's home directory will still be entered in the
appropriate field in the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file. The use of this
option does not imply that this field should be empty. Rather, it
indicates to <strong>adduser</strong> that some other mechanism will be
responsible for initializing the new user's home directory. Valid Modes:
<strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--quiet</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Suppress informational messages, only show warnings and errors.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--shell</strong><em> shell </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use <em>shell</em> as the user's login shell, rather than the default
specified by the configuration file (or <em>/usr/sbin/nologin</em> if
<strong>adduser --system</strong> is used). Valid Modes:
<strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--system</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Nomally, <strong>adduser</strong> creates <em>dynamically allocated
user accounts and groups</em> as defined in Debian Policy, Chapter
9.2.2. With this option, <strong>adduser</strong> creates a
<em>dynamically allocated system user and group</em> and changes its
mode respectively. Valid Modes: <strong>adduser</strong>,
<strong>addgroup</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--uid</strong><em> ID </em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Force the new userid to be the given number. <strong>adduser</strong>
will fail if the userid is already taken. Valid Modes:
<strong>adduser</strong>, <strong>adduser --system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--verbose</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Be more verbose.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong> , <strong>--version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display version and copyright information.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXIT VALUES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>0</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Success: The user or group exists as specified. This can have 2
causes: The user or group was created by this call to
<strong>adduser</strong> or the user or group was already present on the
system as specified before <strong>adduser</strong> was invoked. If
<strong>adduser --system</strong> is invoked for a user already existing
as a system user, it will also return 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>1</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Creating the non-system user or group failed because it was already
present. The username or groupname was rejected because of a mismatch
with the configured regular expressions, see
<strong>adduser.conf</strong>(5). <strong>adduser</strong> has been
aborted by a signal.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or for many other yet undocumented reasons which are printed to
console then. You may then consider to remove <strong>--quiet</strong>
to make <strong>adduser</strong> more verbose.</p>
<h1>SECURITY</h1>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> needs root privileges and offers, via the
<strong>--conf</strong> command line option to use different
configuration files. Do not use <strong>sudo</strong>(8) or similar
tools to give partial privileges to <strong>adduser</strong> with
restricted command line parameters. This is easy to circumvent and might
allow users to create arbitrary accounts. If you want this, consider
writing your own wrapper script and giving privileges to execute that
script.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>

<strong>addgroup</strong>(8)</p>

<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, the term <em>system account</em> suffers from double
use in Debian. It both means an account for the actual Debian system,
distinguishing itself from an <em>application account</em> which might
exist in the user database of some application running on Debian. A
<em>system account</em> in this definition has the potential to log in
to the actual system, has a UID, can be member in system groups, can own
files and processes. Debian Policy, au contraire, in its Chapter 9.2.2,
makes a distinguishment of <em>dynamically allocated system users and
groups</em> and <em>dynamically allocated user accounts</em>, meaning in
both cases special instances of <em>system accounts</em>. Care must be
taken to not confuse this terminology. Since <strong>adduser</strong>
and <strong>deluser</strong>(8) never address <em>application
accounts</em> and everything in this package concerns <em>system
accounts</em> here, the usage of the terms <em>user account</em> and
<em>system account</em> is actually not ambiguous in the context of this
package. For clarity, this document uses the definition <em>local system
account or group</em> if the distinction to <em>application
accounts</em> or accounts managed in a directory service is needed.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> used to have the vision to be the universal
front end to the various directory services for creation and deletion of
regular and system accounts in Debian since the 1990ies. This vision has
been abandoned as of 2022. The rationale behind this includes: that in
practice, a small server system is not going to have write access to an
enterprise-wide directory service anyway, that locally installed
packages are hard to manage with centrally controlled system accounts,
that enterprise directory services have their own management processes
anyway and that the personpower of the <strong>adduser</strong> team is
unlikely to be ever strong enough to write and maintain support for the
plethora of directory services that need support.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> will constrict itself to being a policy
layer for the management of local system accounts, using the tools from
the <strong>password</strong> package for the actual work.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Inconsistent use of terminology around the term <em>system
account</em> in docs and code is a bug. Please report this and allow us
to improve our docs.</p>
<p><strong>adduser</strong> takes special attention to be directly
usable in Debian maintainer scripts without conditional wrappers, error
suppression and other scaffolding. The only thing that the package
maintainer should need to code is a check for the presence of the
executable in the postrm script. The <strong>adduser</strong>
maintainers consider the need for additional scaffolding a bug and
encourage their fellow Debian package maintainers to file bugs against
the <strong>adduser</strong> package in this case.</p>
