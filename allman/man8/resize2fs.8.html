<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>resize2fs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system resizer</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>resize2fs</strong> [ <strong>-fFpPMbs</strong> ] [
<strong>-d</strong> <em>debug-flags</em> ] [ <strong>-S</strong>
<em>RAID-stride</em> ] [ <strong>-z</strong> <em>undo_file</em> ]
<em>device</em> [ <em>size</em> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>resize2fs</strong> program will resize ext2, ext3, or
ext4 file systems. It can be used to enlarge or shrink an unmounted file
system located on <em>device</em>. If the file system is mounted, it can
be used to expand the size of the mounted file system, assuming the
kernel and the file system supports on-line resizing. (Modern Linux 2.6
kernels will support on-line resize for file systems mounted using ext3
and ext4; ext3 file systems will require the use of file systems with
the resize_inode feature enabled.)</p>
<p>The <em>size</em> parameter specifies the requested new size of the
file system. If no units are specified, the units of the <em>size</em>
parameter shall be the file system blocksize of the file system.
Optionally, the <em>size</em> parameter may be suffixed by one of the
following units designators: 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T' (either upper-case or
lower-case) or 's' for power-of-two kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
terabytes or 512 byte sectors respectively. The <em>size</em> of the
file system may never be larger than the size of the partition. If
<em>size</em> parameter is not specified, it will default to the size of
the partition.</p>
<p>The <strong>resize2fs</strong> program does not manipulate the size
of partitions. If you wish to enlarge a file system, you must make sure
you can expand the size of the underlying partition first. This can be
done using <strong>fdisk</strong>(8) by deleting the partition and
recreating it with a larger size or using <strong>lvextend</strong>(8),
if you're using the logical volume manager <strong>lvm</strong>(8). When
recreating the partition, make sure you create it with the same starting
disk cylinder as before! Otherwise, the resize operation will certainly
not work, and you may lose your entire file system. After running
<strong>fdisk</strong>(8), run resize2fs to resize the ext2 file system
to use all of the space in the newly enlarged partition.</p>
<p>If you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use
<strong>resize2fs</strong> to shrink the size of file system. Then you
may use <strong>fdisk</strong>(8) to shrink the size of the partition.
When shrinking the size of the partition, make sure you do not make it
smaller than the new size of the ext2 file system!</p>
<p>The <strong>-b</strong> and <strong>-s</strong> options enable and
disable the 64bit feature, respectively. The resize2fs program will, of
course, take care of resizing the block group descriptors and moving
other data blocks out of the way, as needed. It is not possible to
resize the file system concurrent with changing the 64bit status.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-b</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns on the 64bit feature, resizes the group descriptors as
necessary, and moves other metadata out of the way.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d <em>debug-flags</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns on various resize2fs debugging features, if they have been
compiled into the binary. <em>debug-flags</em> should be computed by
adding the numbers of the desired features from the following
list:<br />
2 - Debug block relocations<br />
4 - Debug inode relocations<br />
8 - Debug moving the inode table<br />
16 - Print timing information<br />
32 - Debug minimum file system size (-M) calculation</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-f</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Forces resize2fs to proceed with the file system resize operation,
overriding some safety checks which resize2fs normally enforces.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-F</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Flush the file system device's buffer caches before beginning. Only
really useful for doing <strong>resize2fs</strong> time trials.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-M</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Shrink the file system to minimize its size as much as possible,
given the files stored in the file system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-p</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print out percentage completion bars for each
<strong>resize2fs</strong> phase during an offline (non-trivial) resize
operation, so that the user can keep track of what the program is doing.
(For very fast resize operations, no progress bars may be
displayed.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-P</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print an estimate of the number of file system blocks in the file
system if it is shrunk using <strong>resize2fs</strong>'s
<strong>-M</strong> option and then exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-s</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns off the 64bit feature and frees blocks that are no longer in
use.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-S <em>RAID-stride</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>resize2fs</strong> program will heuristically determine
the RAID stride that was specified when the file system was created.
This option allows the user to explicitly specify a RAID stride setting
to be used by resize2fs instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-z</strong><em> undo_file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Before overwriting a file system block, write the old contents of the
block to an undo file. This undo file can be used with e2undo(8) to
restore the old contents of the file system should something go wrong.
If the empty string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file
will be written to a file named resize2fs-<em>device</em>.e2undo in the
directory specified via the <em>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</em> environment
variable.</p>
<p>WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a power or
system crash.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>KNOWN BUGS</h1>
<p>The minimum size of the file system as estimated by resize2fs may be
incorrect, especially for file systems with 1k and 2k blocksizes.</p>
