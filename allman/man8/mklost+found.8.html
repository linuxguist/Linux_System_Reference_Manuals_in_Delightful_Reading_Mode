<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>mklost+found - create a lost+found directory on a mounted Linux
second extended file system</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>mklost+found</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>mklost+found</strong> is used to create a <em>lost+found</em>
directory in the current working directory on a Linux second extended
file system. There is normally a <em>lost+found</em> directory in the
root directory of each file system.</p>
<p><strong>mklost+found</strong> pre-allocates disk blocks to the
<em>lost+found</em> directory so that when <strong>e2fsck</strong>(8) is
being run to recover a file system, it does not need to allocate blocks
in the file system to store a large number of unlinked files. This
ensures that <strong>e2fsck</strong> will not have to allocate data
blocks in the file system during recovery.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
