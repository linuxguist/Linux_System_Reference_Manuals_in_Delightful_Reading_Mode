<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-networkd-wait-online.service,
systemd-networkd-wait-online@.service, systemd-networkd-wait-online -
Wait for network to come online</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-networkd-wait-online.service</p>
<p>systemd-networkd-wait-online@.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> is a oneshot system
service (see <strong>systemd.service</strong>(5)), that waits for the
network to be configured. By default, it will wait for all links it is
aware of and which are managed by
<strong>systemd-networkd.service</strong>(8) to be fully configured or
failed, and for at least one link to be online. Here, online means that
the links operational state is equal or higher than "degraded". The
threshold can be configured by <strong>--operational-state=</strong>
option.</p>
<p>The service systemd-networkd-wait-online.service invokes
<strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> without any options. Thus,
it waits for all managed interfaces to be configured or failed, and for
at least one to be online.</p>
<p>The service systemd-networkd-wait-online@.service takes an interface
name, and invokes <strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> with
<strong>-i</strong> and the specified interface name. Thus, wait for the
specified interface to be configured and online. For example,
systemd-networkd-wait-online@eth0.service waits for eth0 to be
configured by <strong>systemd-networkd</strong> and online.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p><strong>-i</strong>
<em>INTERFACE</em>[:<em>MIN_OPERSTATE</em>[:<em>MAX_OPERSTATE</em>]],
<strong>--interface=</strong><em>INTERFACE</em>[:<em>MIN_OPERSTATE</em>[:<em>MAX_OPERSTATE</em>]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Network interface to wait for before deciding if the system is
online. This is useful when a system has several interfaces which will
be configured, but a particular one is necessary to access some network
resources. When used, all other interfaces are ignored. This option may
be used more than once to wait for multiple network interfaces. When
this option is specified multiple times, then
<strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> waits for all specified
interfaces to be online. Optionally, required minimum and maximum
operational states can be specified after a colon ":". Please see
<strong>networkctl</strong>(1) for possible operational states. If the
operational state is not specified here, then the value from
<em>RequiredForOnline=</em> in the corresponding .network file is used
if present, and "degraded" otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--ignore=</strong><em>INTERFACE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Network interfaces to be ignored when deciding if the system is
online. By default, only the loopback interface is ignored. This option
may be used more than once to ignore multiple network interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-o</strong> <em>MIN_OPERSTATE</em>[:<em>MAX_OPERSTATE</em>],
<strong>--operational-state=</strong><em>MIN_OPERSTATE</em>[:<em>MAX_OPERSTATE</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational
state. Please see <strong>networkctl</strong>(1) for possible
operational states. If set, the specified value overrides
<em>RequiredForOnline=</em> settings in .network files. But this does
not override operational states specified in
<strong>--interface=</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-4</strong>, <strong>--ipv4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waiting for an IPv4 address of each network interface to be
configured. If this option is specified with <strong>--any</strong>,
then <strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> exits with success
when at least one interface becomes online and has an IPv4 address. If
the required minimum operational state is below "routable", then each
link (or at least one link with <strong>--any</strong>) must have an
IPv4 link-local or routable address. If the required minimum operational
state is "routable", then each link must have an IPv4 routable
address.</p>
<p>If neither <strong>--ipv4</strong> nor <strong>--ipv6</strong> is
specified, then the value from <em>RequiredFamilyForOnline=</em> in the
corresponding .network file is used if present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-6</strong>, <strong>--ipv6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waiting for an IPv6 address of each network interface to be
configured. If this option is specified with <strong>--any</strong>,
then <strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> exits with success
when at least one interface becomes online and has an IPv6 address. If
the required minimum operational state is below "routable", then each
link (or at least one link with <strong>--any</strong>) must have an
IPv6 link-local or routable address. If the required minimum operational
state is "routable", then each link must have an IPv6 routable
address.</p>
<p>If neither <strong>--ipv4</strong> nor <strong>--ipv6</strong> is
specified, then the value from <em>RequiredFamilyForOnline=</em> in the
corresponding .network file is used if present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--any</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if several interfaces are in configuring state,
<strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> exits with success when at
least one interface becomes online. When this option is specified with
<strong>--interface=</strong>, then
<strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> waits for one of the
specified interfaces to be online. This option is useful when some
interfaces may not have carrier on boot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--timeout=</strong><em>SECS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fail the service if the network is not online by the time the timeout
elapses. A timeout of 0 disables the timeout. Defaults to 120
seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-q</strong>, <strong>--quiet</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress log messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
