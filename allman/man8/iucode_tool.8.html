<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>iucode_tool - Tool to manipulate Intel® IA-32/X86-64 microcode
bundles</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> [<em>options</em>] [[-t<em>type</em>]
<em>filename</em>|<em>dirname</em>] ...</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> is an utility that can load Intel®
processor microcode data from files in both text and binary microcode
bundle formats.</p>
<p>It can output a list of the microcodes in these files, merge them,
upload them to the kernel (to upgrade the microcode in the system
processor cores) or write some of them out to a file in binary format
for later use.</p>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> will load all microcodes in the
specified files and directories to memory, in order to process them.
Duplicated and outdated microcodes will be discarded. It can read
microcode data from standard input (<em>stdin</em>), by specifying a
file name of “-” (minus sign).</p>
<p>Microcode data files are assumed to be in .dat text format if they
have a .dat suffix, and to be in binary format otherwise. Standard input
(<em>stdin</em>) is assumed to be in .dat text format. The <em>-t</em>
option can be used to change the type of the files specified after it,
including for <em>stdin</em>.</p>
<p>If a directory is specified, all files whose names do not begin with
a dot will be loaded, in unspecified order. Nested directories are
skipped.</p>
<p>Empty files and directories are ignored, and will be skipped.</p>
<p>You can select which microcodes should be written out, listed or
uploaded to the kernel using the <em>-S</em>, <em>-s</em>,
<em>--date-before</em> and <em>--date-after</em> options. Should none of
those options be specified, all microcodes will be selected.</p>
<p>You can upload the selected microcodes to the kernel, write them out
to a file (in binary format), to a Linux early initramfs archive, to
per-processor-signature files in a directory, or to per-microcode files
in a directory using the <em>-w</em>, <em>--write-earlyfw</em>,
<em>-k</em>, <em>-K</em>, and <em>-W</em> options.</p>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> will identify microcodes in its output
and error messages using a “<em>n/k</em>” notation, where “<em>n</em>”
is the bundle number, and “<em>k</em>” is the microcode number within
that bundle. The output of the <em>--list-all</em> option when
processing multiple input files is the best example of how it works.</p>
<p>For more information about Intel processor microcodes, please read
the included documentation and the Intel manuals listed in the <em>SEE
ALSO</em> section.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> accepts the following options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-q</strong>, <strong>--quiet</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Inhibit usual output.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong>, <strong>--verbose</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print more information. Use more than once for added verbosity.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>-?</strong>,
<strong>--help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List all available options and their meanings.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--usage</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Show summary of options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Show version of program.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-t </strong><em>type</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the file type of the following files. <em>type</em> can be:</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>binary format. This is the same format used by the kernel driver
and the BIOS/EFI, which is described in detail by the <em>Intel 64 and
IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A</em>, section
9.11.</p></li>
<li><p>Intel microcode .dat text format. This is the format normally
used by Intel to distribute microcode data files.</p></li>
<li><p>recover microcode in binary format. Search uncompressed generic
binary files for microcodes in Intel microcode binary format to recover.
Note: It can find microcode that will not pass strict checks, and thus
cause <strong>iucode_tool</strong> to exit if the
<em>--no-strict-checks</em> or <em>--ignore-broken</em> options are not
in effect.</p></li>
<li><p>(default) <strong>iucode_tool</strong> will use the suffix of the
file name to select the file type: .dat text format for files that have
a <em>.dat</em> suffix, and binary type otherwise. Note that for
<em>stdin</em>, .dat text format is assumed.</p></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--downgrade</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When multiple versions of the microcode for a specific processor are
available from different files, keep the one from the file loaded last,
regardless of revision levels. Files are always loaded in the order they
were specified in the command line. This option has no effect when just
one file has been loaded.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--no-downgrade</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When multiple versions of the microcode for a specific processor are
available from different files, keep the one with the highest revision
level. This is the default mode of operation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--strict-checks</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Perform strict checks on the microcode data. It will refuse to load
microcodes and microcode data files with unexpected size and metadata.
It will also refuse to load microcode entries that have the same
metadata, but different payload. This is the default mode of
operation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--no-strict-checks</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Perform less strict checks on the microcode data. Use only if you
happen to come across a microcode data file that has microcodes with
weird sizes or incorrect non-critical metadata (such as invalid dates),
which you want to retain. If you just want to skip those, use the
<em>--ignore-broken</em> option.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--ignore-broken</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Skip broken microcode entries when loading a microcode data file,
instead of aborting program execution. If the microcode entry has an
unsupported format or had its header severely corrupted, all remaining
data in the file will have to be ignored. In that case, using a file
type of <em>recover</em> microcode in binary format (<em>-tr</em>
option) is recommended, as it can skip over badly mangled microcode
data.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--no-ignore-broken</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Abort program execution if a broken microcode is found while loading
a microcode data file. This is the default mode of operation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-s ! |
[!]</strong><em>signature</em><strong>[,[</strong><em>pf_mask</em><strong>][,[</strong><em>lt:</em><strong>|</strong><em>eq:</em><strong>|</strong><em>gt:</em><strong>]</strong><em>revision</em><strong>]]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Select microcodes by the specified <em>signature</em>, <em>processor
flags mask</em> (<em>pf_mask</em>), and <em>revision</em>.</p>
<p>If the <em>processor flags mask</em> is specified, it will select
only microcodes that are suitable for at least one of the processor flag
combinations present in the mask.</p>
<p>If the <em>revision</em> is specified, optionally prefixed by one of
the “<em>eq:</em>”, “<em>lt:</em>” or “<em>gt:</em>” operators, it will
select only microcodes that have that same <em>revision</em> (if no
operator, or if the “<em>eq:</em>” operator is used), or microcodes that
have a <em>revision</em> that is less than (“<em>lt:</em>” operator), or
greater than (“<em>gt:</em>” operator), the one specified.</p>
<p>Specify more than once to select more microcodes. This option can be
combined with the <em>--scan-system</em> option to select more
microcodes. If <em>signature</em> is prefixed with a “<em>!</em>”
(exclamation mark), it will deselect microcodes instead. Ordering
matters, with later <em>-s</em> options overriding earlier ones,
including <em>--scan-system</em>.</p>
<p>When specifying <em>signature</em> and <em>pf_mask</em>, hexadecimal
numbers must be prefixed with “<em>0x</em>”, and octal numbers with
“<em>0</em>”. Decimal numbers must not have leading zeros, otherwise
they would be interpreted as octal numbers.</p>
<p>The special notation <em>-s!</em> (with no <em>signature</em>
parameter) instructs <strong>iucode_tool</strong> to require explicit
inclusion of microcode signatures (using the non-negated form of
<em>-s</em>, or using <em>--scan-system</em>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-S</strong>,
<strong>--scan-system</strong>[=<em>mode</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Select microcodes by scanning online processors on this system for
their signatures.</p>
<p>This option can be used only once, and it can be combined with the
<em>-s</em> option to select more microcodes. The microcodes selected by
<em>--scan-system</em> can also be deselected by a later <em>-s
!signature</em> option.</p>
<p>The optional <em>mode</em> argument (accepted only by the long
version of the option) selects the strategy used to scan processors:</p>
<dl>
<dt>0 or auto</dt>
<dd>
<p>Currently the same as <strong>fast</strong>, but this might change in
future versions if Intel ever deploys multi-signature systems that go
beyond mixed-stepping. This is the default mode of operation, for
backwards compatibility with previous versions of
<strong>iucode_tool</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>1 or fast</dt>
<dd>
<p>Uses the cpuid instruction to detect the signature of the processor
<strong>iucode_tool</strong> is running on, and selects all steppings
for that processor's type, family and model. Supports mixed-stepping
systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2 or exact</dt>
<dd>
<p>Uses kernel drivers to scan the signature of every online processor
directly. This mode supports multi-signature systems. This scan mode
will be slow on large systems with many processors, and likely requires
special permissions (such as running as the root user). Should the scan
fail for any reason, as a fail-safe measure, it will issue an warning
and consider all possible steppings for every signature it did manage to
scan successfully.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--date-before</strong>=<em>YYYY-MM-DD</em> and
<strong>--date-after</strong>=<em>YYYY-MM-DD</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Limit the selected microcodes by a date range. The date must be given
in ISO format, with four digits for the year and two digits for the
month and day and “<em>-</em>” (minus sign) for the separator. Dates are
not range-checked, so you can use <em>--date-after=2000-00-00</em> to
select all microcodes dated since January 1st, 2000.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--loose-date-filtering</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a date range is specified, all revisions of the microcode will
be considered for selection (ignoring just the date range, all other
filters still apply) should any of the microcode's revisions be within
the date range.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--strict-date-filtering</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a date range is specified, select only microcodes which are
within the date range. This is the default mode of operation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-l</strong>, <strong>--list</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List selected microcode signatures to standard output
(<em>stdout</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-L</strong>, <strong>--list-all</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List all microcode signatures while they're being processed to
standard output (<em>stdout</em>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-k</strong>[<em>device</em>],
<strong>--kernel</strong>[=<em>device</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Upload selected microcodes to the kernel. Optionally, the device path
can be specified (default:
<em>/dev/cpu/microcode</em>").<em>This</em>update<em>method</em>is<em>deprecated:</em>
it will be removed eventually from the kernel and from iucode_tool.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-K</strong>[<em>directory</em>],
<strong>--write-firmware</strong>[=<em>directory</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write selected microcodes with the file names expected by the Linux
kernel firmware loader. Optionally, the destination directory can be
specified (default: <em>/lib/firmware/intel-ucode</em>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-w<em>file</em></strong>,
<strong>--write-to</strong>=<em>file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write selected microcodes to a file in binary format.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--write-earlyfw</strong>=<em>file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write selected microcodes to an early initramfs archive, which should
be prepended to the regular initramfs to allow the kernel to update
processor microcode very early during system boot.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-W<em>directory</em></strong>,
<strong>--write-named-to</strong>=<em>directory</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write selected microcodes to the specified directory, one microcode
per file, in binary format. The file names reflect the microcode
signature, processor flags mask and revision.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--write-all-named-to</strong>=<em>directory</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write every microcode to the specified directory, one microcode per
file, in binary format. The file names reflect the microcode signature,
processor flags mask and revision. This is the only way to write out
every revision of the same microcode.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--overwrite</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove the destination file before writing, if it exists and is not a
directory. The destination file is not overwritten in-place. Hardlinks
will be severed, and any existing access permissions, ACLs and other
extended attributes of the old destination file will be lost.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--no-overwrite</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Abort if the destination file already exists. This is the default
mode of operation. Do note that iucode_tool does not follow
non-directory symlinks when writing files.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--mini-earlyfw</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Optimize the early initramfs cpio container for minimal size. It will
change the cpio block size to 16 bytes, and remove header entries for
the parent directories of the microcode data file. As a result, the
microcode data file will not be available to the regular initramfs, and
tools might complain about the non-standard cpio block size.</p>
<p>This will typically reduce the early initramfs size by 736 bytes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--normal-earlyfw</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Optimize the early initramfs size for tool compatibility. This is the
default mode of operation. The microcode data file will be available
inside the regular initramfs as well.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> reads all data to memory before doing
any processing. It enforces a sanity limit of a maximum of 1GiB worth of
binary microcode data per microcode data file.</p>
<p>All informational and error messages are sent to standard error
(<em>stderr</em>), while user-requested output (such as output generated
by the list options) is sent to standard output (<em>stdout</em>).</p>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> creates files with permissions 0644
(rw-r--r--), modified by the current umask.</p>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong>'s selected microcode listing and
microcode output files are sorted first by <em>processor signature</em>
(in ascending order), and then by <em>processor flags mask</em> (in
descending order).</p>
<p>When multiple revisions of a microcode are selected, the older ones
will be skipped. Only the newest selected revision of a microcode (or
the last one in load order when the <em>--downgrade</em> option is
active) will be written to a file or uploaded to the kernel.</p>
<p>Intel microcode data files, both in binary and text formats, can be
concatenated to generate a bigger and still valid microcode data
file.</p>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> does not follow symlinks when writing
microcode data files. It will either refuse to write the file and abort
(default mode of operation), or (when the <em>--overwrite</em> option is
active) it will remove the target symlink or file (and therefore
breaking hardlinks) <em>before</em> writing the new file.</p>
<p><strong>iucode_tool</strong> does follow directory symlinks to locate
the directory to write files into.</p>
<h2>Linux Notes</h2>
<p>Before Linux v4.4, the microcode update driver was split in two
parts: the early microcode update driver (which gets microcode data from
the initramfs) and the late microcode update driver, which could be a
module and got microcode data from the firmware subsystem. The two
drivers were unified in Linux v4.4.</p>
<p>The microcode update driver needs to be present in the system at all
times to ensure microcode updates are reapplied on resume from suspend
and CPU hotplug. Do not unload the microcode module, unless you really
know better. Since Linux v4.4, the late microcode driver cannot be a
module anymore and will always be present in the system when
enabled.</p>
<p>Updating microcode early is safer. It can only be done at boot and it
requires an initramfs, but it is strongly recommended: late microcode
updates (which read microcode data from /lib/firmware) cannot safely
change visible processor features.</p>
<p>Early microcode updates are available since Linux v3.9. They can
safely change visible processor features (such as the microcode updates
that disabled Intel TSX instructions on Intel Haswell cores do). They
require an uncompressed initramfs image with the microcode update data
in <em>/kernel/x86/microcode/GenuineIntel.bin</em>. This uncompressed
initramfs image must come before any compressed initramfs image(s), and
it has an special name: <em>early initramfs</em>.</p>
<p>The microcode update data inside the early initramfs image must be
aligned to a 16-byte boundary due to a bug in several versions of the
Linux kernel early microcode update driver. This requires special steps
when creating the initramfs archive with the microcode data, and will be
handled automatically by the <strong>iucode_tool</strong>
<em>--write-earlyfw</em> option.</p>
<p>Since Linux v4.2, it is also possible to build a kernel with the
microcode update data as built-in firmware, using the
CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL facility. This feature is not yet mature as of
Linux v4.2.8, v4.4.11, v4.5.5 and v4.6, and might not work in every
case.</p>
<p>The <em>/dev/cpu/microcode</em> update interface has been deprecated
and should not be used. It has one special requirement: each write
syscall must contain whole microcode(s). It can be accessed through
<strong>iucode_tool</strong> <em>--kernel</em>.</p>
<p>Up to Linux v3.5, late microcode updates were required to be
triggered per-core, by writing the number 1 to
<em>/sys/devices/system/cpu/*/microcode/reload</em> for every cpu.
Depending on kernel version, you must either trigger it on every core to
avoid a dangerous situation where some cores are using outdated
microcode, or the kernel will accept the request only for the boot
processor and use it to trigger an update on all system processor
cores.</p>
<p>Since Linux v3.6, the late microcode update driver has a new
interface that explicitly triggers an update for every core at once when
the number 1 is written to
<em>/sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload</em>.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<h2>Updating files in <em>/lib/firmware/intel-ucode</em>:</h2>
<p>iucode_tool -K/lib/firmware/intel-ucode \<br />
/lib/firmware/intel-ucode \<br />
/tmp/file-with-new-microcodes.bin</p>
<h2>Processing several compressed files at once:</h2>
<p>zcat intel-microcode*.dat.gz | iucode_tool -l -</p>
<p>zcat intel-microcode*.bin.gz | iucode_tool -l -tb -</p>
<h2>Selecting microcodes and creating an early initramfs:</h2>
<p>iucode_tool --scan-system \<br />
--write-earlyfw=/tmp/early.cpio \<br />
/lib/firmware/intel-ucode</p>
<p>iucode_tool -s 0x106a5 -s 0x106a4 -l /lib/firmware/intel-ucode</p>
<h2>Using the recovery loader to load and to update microcode in an
early initramfs:</h2>
<p>iucode_tool -L -tr /boot/intel-ucode.img</p>
<p>iucode_tool -Ll -S --write-earlyfw=/boot/intel-ucode.img.new \<br />
-tr /boot/intel-ucode.img -tb /lib/firmware/intel-ucode &amp;&amp;
\<br />
mv /boot/intel-ucode.img.new /boot/intel-ucode.img</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Microcode with negative revision numbers is not special-cased, and
will not be preferred over regular microcode.</p>
<p>The <em>downgrade mode</em> should be used only for microcodes with
the same <em>processor flags mask</em>. It cannot handle the corner
cases where modifying a <em>processor flags mask</em> would be required
to force the kernel to load a lower revision of a microcode, and
<strong>iucode_tool</strong> will issue an warning when that happens. So
far, this has not proved to be a relevant limitation as changes to the
<em>processor flags mask</em> of post-launch, production microcode
updates are very rare.</p>
<p>The <em>loader version</em> microcode metadata field is ignored by
<strong>iucode_tool</strong>. This shouldn't cause problems as long as
the same signature never needs more than a single type of loader.</p>
<p>Files are not replaced atomically: if <strong>iucode_tool</strong> is
interrupted while writing to a file, that file will be corrupted.</p>
