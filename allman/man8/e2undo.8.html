<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>e2undo - Replay an undo log for an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>e2undo</strong> [ <strong>-f</strong> ] [ <strong>-h</strong>
] [ <strong>-n</strong> ] [ <strong>-o</strong> <em>offset</em> ] [
<strong>-v</strong> ] [ <strong>-z</strong> <em>undo_file</em> ]
<em>undo_log device</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>e2undo</strong> will replay the undo log <em>undo_log</em>
for an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system found on <em>device</em>. This can be
used to undo a failed operation by an e2fsprogs program.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-f</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Normally, <strong>e2undo</strong> will check the file system
superblock to make sure the undo log matches with the file system on the
device. If they do not match, <strong>e2undo</strong> will refuse to
apply the undo log as a safety mechanism. The <strong>-f</strong> option
disables this safety mechanism.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-h</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display a usage message.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-n</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Dry-run; do not actually write blocks back to the file system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-o</strong><em> offset</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the file system's <em>offset</em> (in bytes) from the
beginning of the device or file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Report which block we're currently replaying.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-z</strong><em> undo_file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Before overwriting a file system block, write the old contents of the
block to an undo file. This undo file can be used with e2undo(8) to
restore the old contents of the file system should something go wrong.
If the empty string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file
will be written to a file named e2undo-<em>device</em>.e2undo in the
directory specified via the <em>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</em> environment
variable.</p>
<p>WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a power or
system crash.</p>
