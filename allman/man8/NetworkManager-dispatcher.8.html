<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>NetworkManager-dispatcher - Dispatch user scripts for
NetworkManager</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>NetworkManager</strong> <strong>[OPTIONS...]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>NetworkManager-dispatcher service is a D-Bus activated service that
runs user provided scripts upon certain changes in NetworkManager.</p>
<p>NetworkManager-dispatcher will execute scripts in the
/{etc,usr/lib}/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d directory or subdirectories
in alphabetical order in response to network events. Each script should
be a regular executable file owned by root. Furthermore, it must not be
writable by group or other, and not setuid.</p>
<p>Each script receives two arguments, the first being the interface
name of the device an operation just happened on, and second the action.
For device actions, the interface is the name of the kernel interface
suitable for IP configuration. Thus it is either VPN_IP_IFACE,
DEVICE_IP_IFACE, or DEVICE_IFACE, as applicable. For the
<em>hostname</em> action the device name is always "none" and for
<em>connectivity-change</em> it is empty.</p>
<p>The actions are:</p>
<p><em>pre-up</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interface is connected to the network but is not yet fully
activated. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked into
the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d directory, and
NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before
indicating to applications that the interface is fully activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>up</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interface has been activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>pre-down</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interface will be deactivated but has not yet been disconnected
from the network. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or
symlinked into the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d
directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
before disconnecting the interface from its network. Note that this
event is not emitted for forced disconnections, like when carrier is
lost or a wireless signal fades. It is only emitted when there is an
opportunity to cleanly handle a network disconnection event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>down</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interface has been deactivated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>vpn-pre-up</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The VPN is connected to the network but is not yet fully activated.
Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d directory, and NetworkManager
will wait for script execution to complete before indicating to
applications that the VPN is fully activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>vpn-up</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A VPN connection has been activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>vpn-pre-down</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The VPN will be deactivated but has not yet been disconnected from
the network. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked
into the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d directory, and
NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before
disconnecting the VPN from its network. Note that this event is not
emitted for forced disconnections, like when the VPN terminates
unexpectedly or general connectivity is lost. It is only emitted when
there is an opportunity to cleanly handle a VPN disconnection event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>vpn-down</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A VPN connection has been deactivated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>hostname</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system hostname has been updated. Use gethostname(2) to retrieve
it. The interface name (first argument) is empty and no environment
variable is set for this action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>dhcp4-change</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DHCPv4 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>dhcp6-change</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DHCPv6 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>connectivity-change</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The network connectivity state has changed (no connectivity, went
online, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>reapply</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The connection was reapplied on the device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The environment contains more information about the interface and the
connection. The following variables are available for the use in the
dispatcher scripts:</p>
<p><em>NM_DISPATCHER_ACTION</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dispatcher action like "up" or "dhcp4-change", identical to the
first command line argument. Since NetworkManager 1.12.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CONNECTION_UUID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UUID of the connection profile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CONNECTION_ID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name (ID) of the connection profile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CONNECTION_DBUS_PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NetworkManager D-Bus path of the connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CONNECTION_FILENAME</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The backing file name of the connection profile (if any).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CONNECTION_EXTERNAL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If "1", this indicates that the connection describes a network
configuration created outside of NetworkManager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DEVICE_IFACE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interface name of the control interface of the device. Depending
on the device type, this differs from <em>DEVICE_IP_IFACE</em>. For
example for ADSL devices, this could be atm0 or for WWAN devices it
might be ttyUSB0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DEVICE_IP_IFACE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IP interface name of the device. This is the network interface on
which IP addresses and routes will be configured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP4_ADDRESS_N</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IPv4 address in the format "address/prefix gateway", where N is a
number from 0 to (# IPv4 addresses - 1). gateway item in this variable
is deprecated, use IP4_GATEWAY instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variable contains the number of IPv4 addresses the script may
expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP4_GATEWAY</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gateway IPv4 address in traditional numbers-and-dots
notation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP4_ROUTE_N</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IPv4 route in the format "address/prefix next-hop metric", where
N is a number from 0 to (# IPv4 routes - 1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP4_NUM_ROUTES</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variable contains the number of IPv4 routes the script may
expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP4_NAMESERVERS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variable contains a space-separated list of the DNS servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP4_DOMAINS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variable contains a space-separated list of the search
domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DHCP4_&lt;dhcp-option-name&gt;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the connection used DHCP for address configuration, the received
DHCP configuration is passed in the environment using standard DHCP
option names, prefixed with "DHCP4_", like "DHCP4_HOST_NAME=foobar".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IP6_&lt;name&gt; and DHCP6_&lt;name&gt;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same variables as for IPv4 are available for IPv6, but the
prefixes are IP6_ and DHCP6_ instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CONNECTIVITY_STATE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The network connectivity state, which can take the values defined by
the NMConnectivityState type, from the org.freedesktop.NetworkManager
D-Bus API: UNKNOWN, NONE, PORTAL, LIMITED or FULL. Note: this variable
will only be set for connectivity-change actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case of VPN, VPN_IP_IFACE is set, and IP4_*, IP6_* variables with
VPN prefix are exported too, like VPN_IP4_ADDRESS_0,
VPN_IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES.</p>
<p>Dispatcher scripts are run one at a time, but asynchronously from the
main NetworkManager process, and will be killed if they run for too
long. If your script might take arbitrarily long to complete, you should
spawn a child process and have the parent return immediately. Scripts
that are symbolic links pointing inside the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/no-wait.d/ directory are run
immediately, without waiting for the termination of previous scripts,
and in parallel. Also beware that once a script is queued, it will
always be run, even if a later event renders it obsolete. (Eg, if an
interface goes up, and then back down again quickly, it is possible that
one or more "up" scripts will be run after the interface has gone
down.)</p>
