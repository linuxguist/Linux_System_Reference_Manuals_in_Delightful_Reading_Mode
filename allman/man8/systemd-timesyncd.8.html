<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-timesyncd.service, systemd-timesyncd - Network Time
Synchronization</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-timesyncd.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-timesyncd</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-timesyncd is a system service that may be used to synchronize
the local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.
It also saves the local time to disk every time the clock has been
synchronized and uses this to possibly advance the system realtime clock
on subsequent reboots to ensure it (roughly) monotonically advances even
if the system lacks a battery-buffered RTC chip.</p>
<p>The systemd-timesyncd service implements SNTP only. This minimalistic
service will step the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it
for smaller deltas. Complex use cases that require full NTP support (and
where SNTP is not sufficient) are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.</p>
<p>The NTP servers contacted are determined from the global settings in
<strong>timesyncd.conf</strong>(5), the per-link static settings in
.network files, and the per-link dynamic settings received over DHCP.
See <strong>systemd.network</strong>(5) for further details.</p>
<p><strong>timedatectl</strong>(1)s <strong>set-ntp</strong> command may
be used to enable and start, or disable and stop this service.</p>
<p><strong>timedatectl</strong>(1)s <strong>timesync-status</strong> or
<strong>show-timesync</strong> command can be used to show the current
status of this service.</p>
<p>systemd-timesyncd initialization delays the start of units that are
ordered after time-set.target (see <strong>systemd.special</strong>(7)
for details) until the local time has been updated from
/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock (see below) in order to make it roughly
monotonic. It does not delay other units until synchronization with an
accurate reference time sources has been reached. Use
<strong>systemd-time-wait-sync.service</strong>(8) to achieve that,
which will delay start of units that are ordered after time-sync.target
until synchronization to an accurate reference clock is reached.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The modification time ("mtime") of this file is updated on each
successful NTP synchronization or after each <em>SaveIntervalSec=</em>
time interval, as specified in <strong>timesyncd.conf</strong>(5).</p>
<p>When initializing, the local clock is advanced to the modification
time of this file (if the file timestamp is in the past this adjustment
is not made). If the file does not exist yet, the clock is instead
advanced to the modification time of /usr/lib/clock-epoch – if it exists
– or to a time derived from the source tree at build time. This
mechanism is used to ensure that the system clock remains somewhat
reasonably initialized and roughly monotonic across reboots, in case no
battery-buffered local RTC is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/usr/lib/clock-epoch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The modification time ("mtime") of this file is used for advancing
the system clock in case /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock does not exist
yet, see above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/run/systemd/timesync/synchronized</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A file that is touched on each successful synchronization, to assist
systemd-time-wait-sync and other applications to detecting
synchronization with accurate reference clocks.</p>
