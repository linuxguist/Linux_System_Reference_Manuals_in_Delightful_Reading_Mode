<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>nss-myhostname, libnss_myhostname.so.2 - Hostname resolution for the
locally configured system hostname</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>libnss_myhostname.so.2</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>nss-myhostname</strong> is a plug-in module for the GNU Name
Service Switch (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library
(<strong>glibc</strong>), primarily providing hostname resolution for
the locally configured system hostname as returned by
<strong>gethostname</strong>(2). The precise hostnames resolved by this
module are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The local, configured hostname is resolved to all locally configured
IP addresses ordered by their scope, or — if none are configured — the
IPv4 address 127.0.0.2 (which is on the local loopback) and the IPv6
address ::1 (which is the local host).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The hostnames "localhost" and "localhost.localdomain" (as well as any
hostname ending in ".localhost" or ".localhost.localdomain") are
resolved to the IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The hostname "_gateway" is resolved to all current default routing
gateway addresses, ordered by their metric. This assigns a stable
hostname to the current gateway, useful for referencing it independently
of the current network configuration state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The hostname "_outbound" is resolved to the local IPv4 and IPv6
addresses that are most likely used for communication with other hosts.
This is determined by requesting a routing decision to the configured
default gateways from the kernel and then using the local IP addresses
selected by this decision. This hostname is only available if there is
at least one local default gateway configured. This assigns a stable
hostname to the local outbound IP addresses, useful for referencing them
independently of the current network configuration state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various software relies on an always-resolvable local hostname. When
using dynamic hostnames, this is traditionally achieved by patching
/etc/hosts at the same time as changing the hostname. This is
problematic since it requires a writable /etc/ file system and is
fragile because the file might be edited by the administrator at the
same time. With <strong>nss-myhostname</strong> enabled, changing
/etc/hosts is unnecessary, and on many systems, the file becomes
entirely optional.</p>
<p>To activate the NSS modules, add "myhostname" to the line starting
with "hosts:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.</p>
<p>It is recommended to place "myhostname" after "file" and before
"dns". This resolves well-known hostnames like "localhost" and the
machine hostnames locally. It is consistent with the behaviour of
<strong>nss-resolve</strong>, and still allows overriding via
/etc/hosts.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that <strong>nss-myhostname</strong> (and
<strong>nss-resolve</strong>) also resolve in the other direction — from
locally attached IP addresses to hostnames. If you rely on that lookup
being provided by DNS, you might want to order things differently.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Here is an example /etc/nsswitch.conf file that enables
<strong>nss-myhostname</strong> correctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>passwd:         compat systemd
group:          compat [SUCCESS=merge] systemd
shadow:         compat systemd
gshadow:        files systemd


hosts:          mymachines resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] files myhostname dns
networks:       files

protocols:      db files
services:       db files
ethers:         db files
rpc:            db files

netgroup:       nis</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To test, use <strong>glibc</strong>s <strong>getent</strong>
tool:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ getent ahosts `hostname`
::1       STREAM omega
::1       DGRAM
::1       RAW
127.0.0.2       STREAM
127.0.0.2       DGRAM
127.0.0.2       RAW</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the local hostname is <em>omega</em>.</p>
