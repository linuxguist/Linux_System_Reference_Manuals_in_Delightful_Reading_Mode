<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree,
the file hierarchy, rooted at <em>/</em>. These files can be spread out
over several devices. The <strong>mount</strong> command serves to
attach the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree.
Conversely, the <strong>umount</strong>(8) command will detach it again.
The filesystem is used to control how data is stored on the device or
provided in a virtual way by network or other services.</p>
<p>The standard form of the <strong>mount</strong> command is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount -t</strong> <em>type device dir</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on
<em>device</em> (which is of type <em>type</em>) at the directory
<em>dir</em>. The option <strong>-t</strong> <em>type</em> is optional.
The <strong>mount</strong> command is usually able to detect a
filesystem. The root permissions are necessary to mount a filesystem by
default. See section "Non-superuser mounts" below for more details. The
previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of <em>dir</em> become
invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted, the pathname
<em>dir</em> refers to the root of the filesystem on
<em>device</em>.</p>
<p>If only the directory or the device is given, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount</strong> <em>/dir</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then <strong>mount</strong> looks for a mountpoint (and if not found
then for a device) in the <em>/etc/fstab</em> file. It’s possible to use
the <strong>--target</strong> or <strong>--source</strong> options to
avoid ambiguous interpretation of the given argument. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount --target</strong> <em>/mountpoint</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same filesystem may be mounted more than once, and in some cases
(e.g., network filesystems) the same filesystem may be mounted on the
same mountpoint multiple times. The <strong>mount</strong> command does
not implement any policy to control this behavior. All behavior is
controlled by the kernel and it is usually specific to the filesystem
driver. The exception is <strong>--all</strong>, in this case already
mounted filesystems are ignored (see <strong>--all</strong> below for
more details).</p>
<h2>Listing the mounts</h2>
<p>The listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility only.</p>
<p>For more robust and customizable output use
<strong>findmnt</strong>(8), <strong>especially in your
scripts</strong>. Note that control characters in the mountpoint name
are replaced with '?'.</p>
<p>The following command lists all mounted filesystems (of type
<em>type</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount</strong> [<strong>-l</strong>] [<strong>-t</strong>
<em>type</em>]<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The option <strong>-l</strong> adds labels to this listing. See
below.</p>
<h2>Indicating the device and filesystem</h2>
<p>Most devices are indicated by a filename (of a block special device),
like <em>/dev/sda1</em>, but there are other possibilities. For example,
in the case of an NFS mount, <em>device</em> may look like
<em>knuth.cwi.nl:/dir</em>.</p>
<p>The device names of disk partitions are unstable; hardware
reconfiguration, and adding or removing a device can cause changes in
names. This is the reason why it’s strongly recommended to use
filesystem or partition identifiers like UUID or LABEL. Currently
supported identifiers (tags):</p>
<p>LABEL=<em>label</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human readable filesystem identifier. See also
<strong>-L</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UUID=<em>uuid</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filesystem universally unique identifier. The format of the UUID is
usually a series of hex digits separated by hyphens. See also
<strong>-U</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>mount</strong> uses UUIDs as strings. The UUIDs
from the command line or from <strong>fstab</strong>(5) are not
converted to internal binary representation. The string representation
of the UUID should be based on lower case characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PARTLABEL=<em>label</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human readable partition identifier. This identifier is independent
on filesystem and does not change by <strong>mkfs</strong> or
<strong>mkswap</strong> operations. It’s supported for example for GUID
Partition Tables (GPT).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PARTUUID=<em>uuid</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Partition universally unique identifier. This identifier is
independent on filesystem and does not change by <strong>mkfs</strong>
or <strong>mkswap</strong> operations. It’s supported for example for
GUID Partition Tables (GPT).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ID=<em>id</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hardware block device ID as generated by udevd. This identifier is
usually based on WWN (unique storage identifier) and assigned by the
hardware manufacturer. See <strong>ls /dev/disk/by-id</strong> for more
details, this directory and running udevd is required. This identifier
is not recommended for generic use as the identifier is not strictly
defined and it depends on udev, udev rules and hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The command <strong>lsblk --fs</strong> provides an overview of
filesystems, LABELs and UUIDs on available block devices. The command
<strong>blkid -p &lt;device&gt;</strong> provides details about a
filesystem on the specified device.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels are
really unique, especially if you move, share or copy the device. Use
<strong>lsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID</strong> to verify that the UUIDs are
really unique in your system.</p>
<p>The recommended setup is to use tags (e.g.
<strong>UUID</strong>=<em>uuid</em>) rather than
<em>/dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,id,partuuid,partlabel}</em> udev symlinks
in the <em>/etc/fstab</em> file. Tags are more readable, robust and
portable. The <strong>mount</strong>(8) command internally uses udev
symlinks, so the use of symlinks in <em>/etc/fstab</em> has no advantage
over tags. For more details see <strong>libblkid</strong>(3).</p>
<p>The <em>proc</em> filesystem is not associated with a special device,
and when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword - for example, <em>proc</em>
- can be used instead of a device specification. (The customary choice
<em>none</em> is less fortunate: the error message 'none already
mounted' from <strong>mount</strong> can be confusing.)</p>
<h2>The files /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts</h2>
<p>The file <em>/etc/fstab</em> (see <strong>fstab</strong>(5)), may
contain lines describing what devices are usually mounted where, using
which options. The default location of the <strong>fstab</strong>(5)
file can be overridden with the <strong>--fstab</strong> <em>path</em>
command-line option (see below for more details).</p>
<p>The command</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount -a</strong> [<strong>-t</strong> <em>type</em>]
[<strong>-O</strong> <em>optlist</em>]<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned in
<em>fstab</em> (of the proper type and/or having or not having the
proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except for those whose line
contains the <strong>noauto</strong> keyword. Adding the
<strong>-F</strong> option will make <strong>mount</strong> fork, so
that the filesystems are mounted in parallel.</p>
<p>When mounting a filesystem mentioned in <em>fstab</em> or
<em>mtab</em>, it suffices to specify on the command line only the
device, or only the mount point.</p>
<p>The programs <strong>mount</strong> and <strong>umount</strong>(8)
traditionally maintained a list of currently mounted filesystems in the
file <em>/etc/mtab</em>. The support for regular classic
<em>/etc/mtab</em> is completely disabled at compile time by default,
because on current Linux systems it is better to make <em>/etc/mtab</em>
a symlink to <em>/proc/mounts</em> instead. The regular <em>mtab</em>
file maintained in userspace cannot reliably work with namespaces,
containers and other advanced Linux features. If the regular
<em>mtab</em> support is enabled, then it’s possible to use the file as
well as the symlink.</p>
<p>If no arguments are given to <strong>mount</strong>, the list of
mounted filesystems is printed.</p>
<p>If you want to override mount options from <em>/etc/fstab</em>, you
have to use the <strong>-o</strong> option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount</strong> <em>device</em>|<em>dir</em>
<strong>-o</strong> <em>options</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then the mount options from the command line will be appended to
the list of options from <em>/etc/fstab</em>. This default behaviour can
be changed using the <strong>--options-mode</strong> command-line
option. The usual behavior is that the last option wins if there are
conflicting ones.</p>
<p>The <strong>mount</strong> program does not read the
<em>/etc/fstab</em> file if both <em>device</em> (or LABEL, UUID, ID,
PARTUUID or PARTLABEL) and <em>dir</em> are specified. For example, to
mount device <strong>foo</strong> at <strong>/dir</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount /dev/foo /dir</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This default behaviour can be changed by using the
<strong>--options-source-force</strong> command-line option to always
read configuration from <em>fstab</em>. For non-root users
<strong>mount</strong> always reads the <em>fstab</em>
configuration.</p>
<h2>Non-superuser mounts</h2>
<p>Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems. However, when
<em>fstab</em> contains the <strong>user</strong> option on a line,
anybody can mount the corresponding filesystem.</p>
<p>Thus, given a line</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>/dev/cdrom /cd iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on an inserted CDROM
using the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount /cd</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <strong>mount</strong> is very strict about non-root users
and all paths specified on command line are verified before
<em>fstab</em> is parsed or a helper program is executed. It’s strongly
recommended to use a valid mountpoint to specify filesystem, otherwise
<strong>mount</strong> may fail. For example it’s a bad idea to use NFS
or CIFS source on command line.</p>
<p>Since util-linux 2.35, <strong>mount</strong> does not exit when user
permissions are inadequate according to libmount’s internal security
rules. Instead, it drops suid permissions and continues as regular
non-root user. This behavior supports use-cases where root permissions
are not necessary (e.g., fuse filesystems, user namespaces, etc).</p>
<p>For more details, see <strong>fstab</strong>(5). Only the user that
mounted a filesystem can unmount it again. If any user should be able to
unmount it, then use <strong>users</strong> instead of
<strong>user</strong> in the <em>fstab</em> line. The
<strong>owner</strong> option is similar to the <strong>user</strong>
option, with the restriction that the user must be the owner of the
special file. This may be useful e.g. for <em>/dev/fd</em> if a login
script makes the console user owner of this device. The
<strong>group</strong> option is similar, with the restriction that the
user must be a member of the group of the special file.</p>
<h2>Bind mount operation</h2>
<p>Remount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount --bind</strong> <em>olddir newdir</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or by using this <em>fstab</em> entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>/</strong><em>olddir</em> <strong>/</strong><em>newdir</em>
<strong>none bind</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this call the same contents are accessible in two places.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that "bind" does not create any
second-class or special node in the kernel VFS. The "bind" is just
another operation to attach a filesystem. There is nowhere stored
information that the filesystem has been attached by a "bind" operation.
The <em>olddir</em> and <em>newdir</em> are independent and the
<em>olddir</em> may be unmounted.</p>
<p>One can also remount a single file (on a single file). It’s also
possible to use a bind mount to create a mountpoint from a regular
directory, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount --bind foo foo</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bind mount call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem, not
possible submounts. The entire file hierarchy including submounts can be
attached a second place by using:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount --rbind</strong> <em>olddir newdir</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the filesystem mount options maintained by the kernel will
remain the same as those on the original mount point. The userspace
mount options (e.g., _netdev) will not be copied by
<strong>mount</strong> and it’s necessary to explicitly specify the
options on the <strong>mount</strong> command line.</p>
<p>Since util-linux 2.27 <strong>mount</strong> permits changing the
mount options by passing the relevant options along with
<strong>--bind</strong>. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount -o bind,ro foo foo</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feature is not supported by the Linux kernel; it is implemented
in userspace by an additional <strong>mount</strong>(2) remounting
system call. This solution is not atomic.</p>
<p>The alternative (classic) way to create a read-only bind mount is to
use the remount operation, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount --bind</strong> <em>olddir newdir</em></p>
<p><strong>mount -o remount,bind,ro</strong> <em>olddir
newdir</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that a read-only bind will create a read-only mountpoint (VFS
entry), but the original filesystem superblock will still be writable,
meaning that the <em>olddir</em> will be writable, but the
<em>newdir</em> will be read-only.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to change nosuid, nodev, noexec, noatime,
nodiratime, relatime and nosymfollow VFS entry flags via a
"remount,bind" operation. The other flags (for example
filesystem-specific flags) are silently ignored. It’s impossible to
change mount options recursively (for example with <strong>-o
rbind,ro</strong>).</p>
<p>Since util-linux 2.31, <strong>mount</strong> ignores the
<strong>bind</strong> flag from <em>/etc/fstab</em> on a
<strong>remount</strong> operation (if <strong>-o remount</strong> is
specified on command line). This is necessary to fully control mount
options on remount by command line. In previous versions the bind flag
has been always applied and it was impossible to re-define mount options
without interaction with the bind semantic. This <strong>mount</strong>
behavior does not affect situations when "remount,bind" is specified in
the <em>/etc/fstab</em> file.</p>
<h2>The move operation</h2>
<p>Move a <strong>mounted tree</strong> to another place (atomically).
The call is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount --move</strong> <em>olddir newdir</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will cause the contents which previously appeared under
<em>olddir</em> to now be accessible under <em>newdir</em>. The physical
location of the files is not changed. Note that <em>olddir</em> has to
be a mountpoint.</p>
<p>Note also that moving a mount residing under a shared mount is
invalid and unsupported. Use <strong>findmnt -o
TARGET,PROPAGATION</strong> to see the current propagation flags.</p>
<h2>Shared subtree operations</h2>
<p>Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its submounts
as shared, private, slave or unbindable. A shared mount provides the
ability to create mirrors of that mount such that mounts and unmounts
within any of the mirrors propagate to the other mirror. A slave mount
receives propagation from its master, but not vice versa. A private
mount carries no propagation abilities. An unbindable mount is a private
mount which cannot be cloned through a bind operation. The detailed
semantics are documented in
<em>Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt</em> file in the kernel
source tree; see also <strong>mount_namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
<p>Supported operations are:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>mount --make-shared mountpoint
mount --make-slave mountpoint
mount --make-private mountpoint
mount --make-unbindable mountpoint</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following commands allow one to recursively change the type of
all the mounts under a given mountpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>mount --make-rshared mountpoint
mount --make-rslave mountpoint
mount --make-rprivate mountpoint
mount --make-runbindable mountpoint</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mount</strong> <strong>does not read</strong>
<strong>fstab</strong>(5) when a <strong>--make-</strong>* operation is
requested. All necessary information has to be specified on the command
line.</p>
<p>Note that the Linux kernel does not allow changing multiple
propagation flags with a single <strong>mount</strong>(2) system call,
and the flags cannot be mixed with other mount options and
operations.</p>
<p>Since util-linux 2.23 the <strong>mount</strong> command can be used
to do more propagation (topology) changes by one
<strong>mount</strong>(8) call and do it also together with other mount
operations. The propagation flags are applied by additional
<strong>mount</strong>(2) system calls when the preceding mount
operations were successful. Note that this use case is not atomic. It is
possible to specify the propagation flags in <strong>fstab</strong>(5)
as mount options (<strong>private</strong>, <strong>slave</strong>,
<strong>shared</strong>, <strong>unbindable</strong>,
<strong>rprivate</strong>, <strong>rslave</strong>,
<strong>rshared</strong>, <strong>runbindable</strong>).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>mount --make-private --make-unbindable /dev/sda1 /foo</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>is the same as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>mount /dev/sda1 /foo
mount --make-private /foo
mount --make-unbindable /foo</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The full set of mount options used by an invocation of
<strong>mount</strong> is determined by first extracting the mount
options for the filesystem from the <em>fstab</em> table, then applying
any options specified by the <strong>-o</strong> argument, and finally
applying a <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-w</strong> option, when
present.</p>
<p>The <strong>mount</strong> command does not pass all command-line
options to the <strong>/sbin/mount.</strong><em>suffix</em> mount
helpers. The interface between <strong>mount</strong> and the mount
helpers is described below in the <strong>EXTERNAL HELPERS</strong>
section.</p>
<p>Command-line options available for the <strong>mount</strong> command
are:</p>
<p><strong>-a</strong>, <strong>--all</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in
<em>fstab</em> (except for those whose line contains the
<strong>noauto</strong> keyword). The filesystems are mounted following
their order in <em>fstab</em>. The <strong>mount</strong> command
compares filesystem source, target (and fs root for bind mount or btrfs)
to detect already mounted filesystems. The kernel table with already
mounted filesystems is cached during <strong>mount --all</strong>. This
means that all duplicated <em>fstab</em> entries will be mounted.</p>
<p>The correct functionality depends on <em>/proc</em> (to detect
already mounted filesystems) and on <em>/sys</em> (to evaluate
filesystem tags like UUID= or LABEL=). It’s strongly recommended to
mount <em>/proc</em> and <em>/sys</em> filesystems before <strong>mount
-a</strong> is executed, or keep /proc and /sys at the beginning of
<em>fstab</em>.</p>
<p>The option <strong>--all</strong> is possible to use for remount
operation too. In this case all filters (<strong>-t</strong> and
<strong>-O</strong>) are applied to the table of already mounted
filesystems.</p>
<p>Since version 2.35 it is possible to use the command line option
<strong>-o</strong> to alter mount options from <em>fstab</em> (see also
<strong>--options-mode</strong>).</p>
<p>Note that it is a bad practice to use <strong>mount -a</strong> for
<em>fstab</em> checking. The recommended solution is <strong>findmnt
--verify</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-B</strong>, <strong>--bind</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are available
in both places). See above, under <strong>Bind mounts</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--no-canonicalize</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t canonicalize paths. The <strong>mount</strong> command
canonicalizes all paths (from the command line or <em>fstab</em>) by
default. This option can be used together with the <strong>-f</strong>
flag for already canonicalized absolute paths. The option is designed
for mount helpers which call <strong>mount -i</strong>. It is strongly
recommended to not use this command-line option for normal mount
operations.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>mount</strong> does not pass this option to the
<strong>/sbin/mount.</strong><em>type</em> helpers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-F</strong>, <strong>--fork</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Used in conjunction with <strong>-a</strong>.) Fork off a new
incarnation of <strong>mount</strong> for each device. This will do the
mounts on different devices or different NFS servers in parallel. This
has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts proceed in
parallel. A disadvantage is that the order of the mount operations is
undefined. Thus, you cannot use this option if you want to mount both
<em>/usr</em> and <em>/usr/spool</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-f, --fake</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if
it’s not obvious, this "fakes" mounting the filesystem. This option is
useful in conjunction with the <strong>-v</strong> flag to determine
what the <strong>mount</strong> command is trying to do. It can also be
used to add entries for devices that were mounted earlier with the
<strong>-n</strong> option. The <strong>-f</strong> option checks for an
existing record in <em>/etc/mtab</em> and fails when the record already
exists (with a regular non-fake mount, this check is done by the
kernel).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-i, --internal-only</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t call the <strong>/sbin/mount.</strong><em>filesystem</em>
helper even if it exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-L</strong>, <strong>--label</strong> <em>label</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount the partition that has the specified <em>label</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-l</strong>, <strong>--show-labels</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add the labels in the mount output. <strong>mount</strong> must have
permission to read the disk device (e.g. be set-user-ID root) for this
to work. One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or ext4 using the
<strong>e2label</strong>(8) utility, or for XFS using
<strong>xfs_admin</strong>(8), or for reiserfs using
<strong>reiserfstune</strong>(8).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-M</strong>, <strong>--move</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move a subtree to some other place. See above, the subsection
<strong>The move operation</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-m</strong>, <strong>--mkdir</strong>[=<em>mode</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not exist
yet. Alias to "-o X-mount.mkdir[=mode]", the default mode is 0755. For
more details see <strong>X-mount.mkdir</strong> below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--no-mtab</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount without writing in <em>/etc/mtab</em>. This is necessary for
example when <em>/etc</em> is on a read-only filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-N</strong>, <strong>--namespace</strong> <em>ns</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform the mount operation in the mount namespace specified by
<em>ns</em>. <em>ns</em> is either PID of process running in that
namespace or special file representing that namespace.</p>
<p><strong>mount</strong> switches to the mount namespace when it reads
<em>/etc/fstab</em>, writes <em>/etc/mtab: (or writes to
_/run/mount</em>) and calls <strong>mount</strong>(2), otherwise it runs
in the original mount namespace. This means that the target namespace
does not have to contain any libraries or other requirements necessary
to execute the <strong>mount</strong>(2) call.</p>
<p>See <strong>mount_namespaces</strong>(7) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-O</strong>, <strong>--test-opts</strong> <em>opts</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the set of filesystems to which the <strong>-a</strong> option
applies. In this regard it is like the <strong>-t</strong> option except
that <strong>-O</strong> is useless without <strong>-a</strong>. For
example, the command</p>
<p><strong>mount -a -O no_netdev</strong></p>
<p>mounts all filesystems except those which have the option
<em>netdev</em> specified in the options field in the
<em>/etc/fstab</em> file.</p>
<p>It is different from <strong>-t</strong> in that each option is
matched exactly; a leading <strong>no</strong> at the beginning of one
option does not negate the rest.</p>
<p>The <strong>-t</strong> and <strong>-O</strong> options are
cumulative in effect; that is, the command</p>
<p><strong>mount -a -t ext2 -O _netdev</strong></p>
<p>mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all
filesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option
specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-o</strong>, <strong>--options</strong> <em>opts</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the specified mount options. The <em>opts</em> argument is a
comma-separated list. For example:</p>
<p><strong>mount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nodev,nosuid</strong></p>
<p>For more details, see the <strong>FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT
OPTIONS</strong> and <strong>FILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS</strong>
sections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--options-mode</strong> <em>mode</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls how to combine options from <em>fstab</em>/<em>mtab</em>
with options from the command line. <em>mode</em> can be one of
<strong>ignore</strong>, <strong>append</strong>,
<strong>prepend</strong> or <strong>replace</strong>. For example,
<strong>append</strong> means that options from <em>fstab</em> are
appended to options from the command line. The default value is
<strong>prepend</strong> — it means command line options are evaluated
after <em>fstab</em> options. Note that the last option wins if there
are conflicting ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--options-source</strong> <em>source</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Source of default options. <em>source</em> is a comma-separated list
of <strong>fstab</strong>, <strong>mtab</strong> and
<strong>disable</strong>. <strong>disable</strong> disables
<strong>fstab</strong> and <strong>mtab</strong> and enables
<strong>--options-source-force</strong>. The default value is
<strong>fstab,mtab</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--options-source-force</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use options from <em>fstab</em>/<em>mtab</em> even if both
<em>device</em> and <em>dir</em> are specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-R</strong>, <strong>--rbind</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else (so that
its contents are available in both places). See above, the subsection
<strong>Bind mounts</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-r</strong>, <strong>--read-only</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is <strong>-o
ro</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel
behavior, the system may still write to the device. For example, ext3
and ext4 will replay the journal if the filesystem is dirty. To prevent
this kind of write access, you may want to mount an ext3 or ext4
filesystem with the <strong>ro,noload</strong> mount options or set the
block device itself to read-only mode, see the
<strong>blockdev</strong>(8) command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-s</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing. This will ignore
mount options not supported by a filesystem type. Not all filesystems
support this option. Currently it’s supported by the
<strong>mount.nfs</strong> mount helper only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--source</strong> <em>device</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If only one argument for the <strong>mount</strong> command is given,
then the argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or
source (device). This option allows you to explicitly define that the
argument is the mount source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--target</strong> <em>directory</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If only one argument for the mount command is given, then the
argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or source
(device). This option allows you to explicitly define that the argument
is the mount target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--target-prefix</strong> <em>directory</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepend the specified directory to all mount targets. This option can
be used to follow <em>fstab</em>, but mount operations are done in
another place, for example:</p>
<p><strong>mount --all --target-prefix /chroot -o
X-mount.mkdir</strong></p>
<p>mounts all from system <em>fstab</em> to <em>/chroot</em>, all
missing mountpoint are created (due to X-mount.mkdir). See also
<strong>--fstab</strong> to use an alternative <em>fstab</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-T</strong>, <strong>--fstab</strong> <em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies an alternative <em>fstab</em> file. If <em>path</em> is a
directory, then the files in the directory are sorted by
<strong>strverscmp</strong>(3); files that start with "." or without an
<em>.fstab</em> extension are ignored. The option can be specified more
than once. This option is mostly designed for initramfs or chroot
scripts where additional configuration is specified beyond standard
system configuration.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>mount</strong> does not pass the option
<strong>--fstab</strong> to the
<strong>/sbin/mount.</strong><em>type</em> helpers, meaning that the
alternative <em>fstab</em> files will be invisible for the helpers. This
is no problem for normal mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always
require <em>fstab</em> to verify the user’s rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-t</strong>, <strong>--types</strong> <em>fstype</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The argument following the <strong>-t</strong> is used to indicate
the filesystem type. The filesystem types which are currently supported
depend on the running kernel. See <em>/proc/filesystems</em> and
<em>/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs</em> for a complete list of the
filesystems. The most common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat,
sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.</p>
<p>The programs <strong>mount</strong> and <strong>umount</strong>(8)
support filesystem subtypes. The subtype is defined by a '.subtype'
suffix. For example 'fuse.sshfs'. It’s recommended to use subtype
notation rather than add any prefix to the mount source (for example
'sshfs#example.com' is deprecated).</p>
<p>If no <strong>-t</strong> option is given, or if the
<strong>auto</strong> type is specified, <strong>mount</strong> will try
to guess the desired type. <strong>mount</strong> uses the
<strong>libblkid</strong>(3) library for guessing the filesystem type;
if that does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
<strong>mount</strong> will try to read the file
<em>/etc/filesystems</em>, or, if that does not exist,
<em>/proc/filesystems</em>. All of the filesystem types listed there
will be tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev" (e.g.
<em>devpts</em>, <em>proc</em> and <em>nfs</em>). If
<em>/etc/filesystems</em> ends in a line with a single *, mount will
read <em>/proc/filesystems</em> afterwards. While trying, all filesystem
types will be mounted with the mount option <strong>silent</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>auto</strong> type may be useful for user-mounted
floppies. Creating a file <em>/etc/filesystems</em> can be useful to
change the probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before
ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.</p>
<p>More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list, for
the <strong>-t</strong> option as well as in an <em>/etc/fstab</em>
entry. The list of filesystem types for the <strong>-t</strong> option
can be prefixed with <strong>no</strong> to specify the filesystem types
on which no action should be taken. The prefix <strong>no</strong> has
no effect when specified in an <em>/etc/fstab</em> entry.</p>
<p>The prefix <strong>no</strong> can be meaningful with the
<strong>-a</strong> option. For example, the command</p>
<p><strong>mount -a -t nomsdos,smbfs</strong></p>
<p>mounts all filesystems except those of type <em>msdos</em> and
<em>smbfs</em>.</p>
<p>For most types all the <strong>mount</strong> program has to do is
issue a simple <strong>mount</strong>(2) system call, and no detailed
knowledge of the filesystem type is required. For a few types however
(like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary. The
nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a separate mount
program. In order to make it possible to treat all types in a uniform
way, <strong>mount</strong> will execute the program
<strong>/sbin/mount.</strong><em>type</em> (if that exists) when called
with type <em>type</em>. Since different versions of the
<strong>smbmount</strong> program have different calling conventions,
<strong>/sbin/mount.smbfs</strong> may have to be a shell script that
sets up the desired call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-U</strong>, <strong>--uuid</strong> <em>uuid</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount the partition that has the specified <em>uuid</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-v</strong>, <strong>--verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Verbose mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-w</strong>, <strong>--rw</strong>,
<strong>--read-write</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount the filesystem read/write. Read-write is the kernel default and
the <strong>mount</strong> default is to try read-only if the previous
<strong>mount</strong>(2) syscall with read-write flags on
write-protected devices failed.</p>
<p>A synonym is <strong>-o rw</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that specifying <strong>-w</strong> on the command line forces
<strong>mount</strong> to never try read-only mount on write-protected
devices or already mounted read-only filesystems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<h1>FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the
<em>/etc/fstab</em> file.</p>
<p>Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by default in the
system kernel. To check the current setting see the options in
<em>/proc/mounts</em>. Note that filesystems also have per-filesystem
specific default mount options (see for example <strong>tune2fs
-l</strong> output for ext<em>N</em> filesystems).</p>
<p>The following options apply to any filesystem that is being mounted
(but not every filesystem actually honors them - e.g., the
<strong>sync</strong> option today has an effect only for ext2, ext3,
ext4, fat, vfat, ufs and xfs):</p>
<p><strong>async</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously. (See also
the <strong>sync</strong> option.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>atime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not use the <strong>noatime</strong> feature, so the inode access
time is controlled by kernel defaults. See also the descriptions of the
<strong>relatime</strong> and <strong>strictatime</strong> mount
options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>noatime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g. for faster
access on the news spool to speed up news servers). This works for all
inode types (directories too), so it implies
<strong>nodiratime</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>auto</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can be mounted with the <strong>-a</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>noauto</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the <strong>-a</strong> option
will not cause the filesystem to be mounted).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>context=</strong><em>context</em>,
<strong>fscontext=</strong><em>context</em>,
<strong>defcontext=</strong><em>context</em>, and
<strong>rootcontext=</strong><em>context</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>context=</strong> option is useful when mounting
filesystems that do not support extended attributes, such as a floppy or
hard disk formatted with VFAT, or systems that are not normally running
under SELinux, such as an ext3 or ext4 formatted disk from a non-SELinux
workstation. You can also use <strong>context=</strong> on filesystems
you do not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps in compatibility with
xattr-supporting filesystems on earlier 2.4.&lt;x&gt; kernel versions.
Even where xattrs are supported, you can save time not having to label
every file by assigning the entire disk one security context.</p>
<p>A commonly used option for removable media is
<strong>context="system_u:object_r:removable_t</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>fscontext=</strong> option works for all filesystems,
regardless of their xattr support. The fscontext option sets the
overarching filesystem label to a specific security context. This
filesystem label is separate from the individual labels on the files. It
represents the entire filesystem for certain kinds of permission checks,
such as during mount or file creation. Individual file labels are still
obtained from the xattrs on the files themselves. The context option
actually sets the aggregate context that fscontext provides, in addition
to supplying the same label for individual files.</p>
<p>You can set the default security context for unlabeled files using
<strong>defcontext=</strong> option. This overrides the value set for
unlabeled files in the policy and requires a filesystem that supports
xattr labeling.</p>
<p>The <strong>rootcontext=</strong> option allows you to explicitly
label the root inode of a FS being mounted before that FS or inode
becomes visible to userspace. This was found to be useful for things
like stateless Linux.</p>
<p>Note that the kernel rejects any remount request that includes the
context option, <strong>even</strong> when unchanged from the current
context.</p>
<p><strong>Warning: the</strong> <em>context</em> <strong>value might
contain commas</strong>, in which case the value has to be properly
quoted, otherwise <strong>mount</strong> will interpret the comma as a
separator between mount options. Don’t forget that the shell strips off
quotes and thus <strong>double quoting is required</strong>. For
example:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mount -t tmpfs none /mnt -o \
'context="system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c127,c456",noexec'<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more details, see <strong>selinux</strong>(8).</p>
<p><strong>defaults</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the default options: <strong>rw</strong>, <strong>suid</strong>,
<strong>dev</strong>, <strong>exec</strong>, <strong>auto</strong>,
<strong>nouser</strong>, and <strong>async</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that the real set of all default mount options depends on the
kernel and filesystem type. See the beginning of this section for more
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>dev</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nodev</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not interpret character or block special devices on the
filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>diratime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update directory inode access times on this filesystem. This is the
default. (This option is ignored when <strong>noatime</strong> is
set.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nodiratime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem. (This
option is implied when <strong>noatime</strong> is set.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>dirsync</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All directory updates within the filesystem should be done
synchronously. This affects the following system calls:
<strong>creat</strong>(2), <strong>link</strong>(2),
<strong>unlink</strong>(2), <strong>symlink</strong>(2),
<strong>mkdir</strong>(2), <strong>rmdir</strong>(2),
<strong>mknod</strong>(2) and <strong>rename</strong>(2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>exec</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Permit execution of binaries and other executable files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>noexec</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not permit direct execution of any binaries on the mounted
filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>group</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if one of that user’s
groups matches the group of the device. This option implies the options
<strong>nosuid</strong> and <strong>nodev</strong> (unless overridden by
subsequent options, as in the option line
<strong>group,dev,suid</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>iversion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be
incremented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>noiversion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not increment the i_version inode field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mand</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem. See
<strong>fcntl</strong>(2). This option was deprecated in Linux 5.15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nomand</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>_netdev</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The filesystem resides on a device that requires network access (used
to prevent the system from attempting to mount these filesystems until
the network has been enabled on the system).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nofail</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>relatime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update inode access times relative to modify or change time. Access
time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier than the
current modify or change time. (Similar to <strong>noatime</strong>, but
it doesn’t break <strong>mutt</strong>(1) or other applications that
need to know if a file has been read since the last time it was
modified.)</p>
<p>Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided by
this option (unless <strong>noatime</strong> was specified), and the
<strong>strictatime</strong> option is required to obtain traditional
semantics. In addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file’s last access time
is always updated if it is more than 1 day old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>norelatime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not use the <strong>relatime</strong> feature. See also the
<strong>strictatime</strong> mount option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>strictatime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allows to explicitly request full atime updates. This makes it
possible for the kernel to default to <strong>relatime</strong> or
<strong>noatime</strong> but still allow userspace to override it. For
more details about the default system mount options see
<em>/proc/mounts</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nostrictatime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the kernel’s default behavior for inode access time updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>lazytime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only update times (atime, mtime, ctime) on the in-memory version of
the file inode.</p>
<p>This mount option significantly reduces writes to the inode table for
workloads that perform frequent random writes to preallocated files.</p>
<p>The on-disk timestamps are updated only when:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated to file
timestamps</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>the application employs <strong>fsync</strong>(2),
<strong>syncfs</strong>(2), or <strong>sync</strong>(2)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>an undeleted inode is evicted from memory</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>more than 24 hours have passed since the inode was written to
disk.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nolazytime</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not use the lazytime feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>suid</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities when
executing programs from this filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nosuid</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities
when executing programs from this filesystem. In addition, SELinux
domain transitions require permission <em>nosuid_transition</em>, which
in turn needs also policy capability <em>nnp_nosuid_transition</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>silent</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn on the silent flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>loud</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off the silent flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>owner</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if that user is the
owner of the device. This option implies the options
<strong>nosuid</strong> and <strong>nodev</strong> (unless overridden by
subsequent options, as in the option line
<strong>owner,dev,suid</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>remount</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem. This is commonly
used to change the mount flags for a filesystem, especially to make a
readonly filesystem writable. It does not change device or mount
point.</p>
<p>The remount operation together with the <strong>bind</strong> flag
has special semantics. See above, the subsection <strong>Bind
mounts</strong>.</p>
<p>The remount functionality follows the standard way the
<strong>mount</strong> command works with options from <em>fstab</em>.
This means that <strong>mount</strong> does not read <em>fstab</em> (or
<em>mtab</em>) only when both <em>device</em> and <em>dir</em> are
specified.</p>
<p><strong>mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir</strong></p>
<p>After this call all old mount options are replaced and arbitrary
stuff from <em>fstab</em> (or <em>mtab</em>) is ignored, except the
<strong>loop=</strong> option which is internally generated and
maintained by the <strong>mount</strong> command.</p>
<p><strong>mount -o remount,rw /dir</strong></p>
<p>After this call, <strong>mount</strong> reads <em>fstab</em> and
merges these options with the options from the command line
(<strong>-o</strong>). If no mountpoint is found in <em>fstab</em>, then
a remount with unspecified source is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>mount</strong> allows the use of <strong>--all</strong> to
remount all already mounted filesystems which match a specified filter
(<strong>-O</strong> and <strong>-t</strong>). For example:</p>
<p><strong>mount --all -o remount,ro -t vfat</strong></p>
<p>remounts all already mounted vfat filesystems in read-only mode. Each
of the filesystems is remounted by <strong>mount -o remount,ro</strong>
<em>/dir</em> semantic. This means the <strong>mount</strong> command
reads <em>fstab</em> or <em>mtab</em> and merges these options with the
options from the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ro</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount the filesystem read-only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>rw</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount the filesystem read-write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>sync</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously. In the case
of media with a limited number of write cycles (e.g. some flash drives),
<strong>sync</strong> may cause life-cycle shortening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. The name of the
mounting user is written to the <em>mtab</em> file (or to the private
libmount file in <em>/run/mount</em> on systems without a regular
<em>mtab</em>) so that this same user can unmount the filesystem again.
This option implies the options <strong>noexec</strong>,
<strong>nosuid</strong>, and <strong>nodev</strong> (unless overridden
by subsequent options, as in the option line
<strong>user,exec,dev,suid</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nouser</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forbid an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. This is the default;
it does not imply any other options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>users</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow any user to mount and to unmount the filesystem, even when some
other ordinary user mounted it. This option implies the options
<strong>noexec</strong>, <strong>nosuid</strong>, and
<strong>nodev</strong> (unless overridden by subsequent options, as in
the option line <strong>users,exec,dev,suid</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>X-</strong>*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All options prefixed with "X-" are interpreted as comments or as
userspace application-specific options. These options are not stored in
user space (e.g., <em>mtab</em> file), nor sent to the
mount.<em>type</em> helpers nor to the <strong>mount</strong>(2) system
call. The suggested format is
<strong>X-</strong><em>appname</em>.<em>option</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>x-</strong>*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same as <strong>X-</strong>* options, but stored permanently in
user space. This means the options are also available for
<strong>umount</strong>(8) or other operations. Note that maintaining
mount options in user space is tricky, because it’s necessary use
libmount-based tools and there is no guarantee that the options will be
always available (for example after a move mount operation or in
unshared namespace).</p>
<p>Note that before util-linux v2.30 the x-* options have not been
maintained by libmount and stored in user space (functionality was the
same as for X-* now), but due to the growing number of use-cases (in
initrd, systemd etc.) the functionality has been extended to keep
existing <em>fstab</em> configurations usable without a change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>X-mount.mkdir</strong>[=<em>mode</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not exist
yet. The optional argument <em>mode</em> specifies the filesystem access
mode used for <strong>mkdir</strong>(2) in octal notation. The default
mode is 0755. This functionality is supported only for root users or
when <strong>mount</strong> is executed without suid permissions. The
option is also supported as <strong>x-mount.mkdir</strong>, but this
notation is deprecated since v2.30. See also <strong>--mkdir</strong>
command line option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>X-mount.subdir=</strong><em>directory</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow mounting sub-directory from a filesystem instead of the root
directory. For now, this feature is implemented by temporary filesystem
root directory mount in unshared namespace and then bind the
sub-directory to the final mount point and umount the root of the
filesystem. The sub-directory mount shows up atomically for the rest of
the system although it is implemented by multiple
<strong>mount</strong>(2) syscalls. This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nosymfollow</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not follow symlinks when resolving paths. Symlinks can still be
created, and <strong>readlink</strong>(1), <strong>readlink</strong>(2),
<strong>realpath</strong>(1), and <strong>realpath</strong>(3) all still
work properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>FILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS</h1>

<p>The following options apply only to certain filesystems. We sort them
by filesystem. All options follow the <strong>-o</strong> flag.</p>
<p>What options are supported depends a bit on the running kernel.
Further information may be available in filesystem-specific files in the
kernel source subdirectory <em>Documentation/filesystems</em>.</p>
<h2>Mount options for adfs</h2>

<h2>Mount options for debugfs</h2>
<p>The debugfs filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted
on <em>/sys/kernel/debug</em>. As of kernel version 3.4, debugfs has the
following options:</p>
<p><strong>uid=</strong><em>n</em><strong>, gid=</strong><em>n</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the owner and group of the mountpoint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mode=</strong><em>value</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the mode of the mountpoint.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Mount options for devpts</h2>
<p>The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted
on <em>/dev/pts</em>. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process
opens <em>/dev/ptmx</em>; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made
available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed
as <em>/dev/pts/</em>&lt;number&gt;.</p>
<p><strong>uid=</strong><em>value</em> and
<strong>gid=</strong><em>value</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This sets the owner or the group of newly created pseudo terminals to
the specified values. When nothing is specified, they will be set to the
UID and GID of the creating process. For example, if there is a tty
group with GID 5, then <strong>gid=5</strong> will cause newly created
pseudo terminals to belong to the tty group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mode=</strong><em>value</em></p>
<blockquote>

<h2>Mount options for iso9660</h2>
<p>ISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to be used
on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs. See also
the <em>udf</em> filesystem.)</p>
<p>Normal <em>iso9660</em> filenames appear in an 8.3 format (i.e.,
DOS-like restrictions on filename length), and in addition all
characters are in upper case. Also there is no field for file ownership,
protection, number of links, provision for block/character devices,
etc.</p>
<p>Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of these
UNIX-like features. Basically there are extensions to each directory
record that supply all of the additional information, and when Rock
Ridge is in use, the filesystem is indistinguishable from a normal UNIX
filesystem (except that it is read-only, of course).</p>

<h2>Mount options for overlay</h2>
<p>Since Linux 3.18 the overlay pseudo filesystem implements a union
mount for other filesystems.</p>
<p>An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an
<strong>upper</strong> filesystem and a <strong>lower</strong>
filesystem. When a name exists in both filesystems, the object in the
upper filesystem is visible while the object in the lower filesystem is
either hidden or, in the case of directories, merged with the upper
object.</p>
<p>The lower filesystem can be any filesystem supported by Linux and
does not need to be writable. The lower filesystem can even be another
overlayfs. The upper filesystem will normally be writable and if it is
it must support the creation of trusted.* extended attributes, and must
provide a valid d_type in readdir responses, so NFS is not suitable.</p>
<p>A read-only overlay of two read-only filesystems may use any
filesystem type. The options <strong>lowerdir</strong> and
<strong>upperdir</strong> are combined into a merged directory by
using:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>mount -t overlay  overlay  \
  -olowerdir=/lower,upperdir=/upper,workdir=/work  /merged</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>lowerdir=</strong><em>directory</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any filesystem, does not need to be on a writable filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>upperdir=</strong><em>directory</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The upperdir is normally on a writable filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>workdir=</strong><em>directory</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>userxattr</strong></p>

<p><strong>redirect_dir=</strong>{<strong>on</strong>|<strong>off</strong>|<strong>follow</strong>|<strong>nofollow</strong>}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the <em>redirect_dir</em> feature is enabled, then the directory

"{<strong>trusted</strong>|<strong>user</strong>}.overlay.redirect"

root of the overlay. Finally the directory is moved to the new
location.</p>

<p>Can be used to replace UUID of the underlying filesystem in file
handles with null, and effectively disable UUID checks. This can be
useful in case the underlying disk is copied and the UUID of this copy
is changed. This is only applicable if all lower/upper/work directories
are on the same filesystem, otherwise it will fallback to normal
behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nfs_export=</strong>{<strong>on</strong>|<strong>off</strong>}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the underlying filesystems supports NFS export and the
"nfs_export" feature is enabled, an overlay filesystem may be exported
to NFS.</p>
<p>With the "nfs_export" feature, on copy_up of any lower object, an
index entry is created under the index directory. The index entry name
is the hexadecimal representation of the copy up origin file handle. For
a non-directory object, the index entry is a hard link to the upper
inode. For a directory object, the index entry has an extended attribute
"{<strong>trusted</strong>|<strong>user</strong>}.overlay.upper" with an
encoded file handle of the upper directory inode.</p>
<p>When encoding a file handle from an overlay filesystem object, the
following rules apply</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>For a non-upper object, encode a lower file handle from lower
inode</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>For an indexed object, encode a lower file handle from copy_up
origin</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>For a pure-upper object and for an existing non-indexed upper object,
encode an upper file handle from upper inode</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The encoded overlay file handle includes</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Header including path type information (e.g. lower/upper)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>UUID of the underlying filesystem</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Underlying filesystem encoding of underlying inode</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This encoding format is identical to the encoding format of file
handles that are stored in extended attribute
"{<strong>trusted</strong>|<strong>user</strong>}.overlay.origin". When
decoding an overlay file handle, the following steps are followed</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Find underlying layer by UUID and path type information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Decode the underlying filesystem file handle to underlying
dentry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>For a lower file handle, lookup the handle in index directory by
name.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>If a whiteout is found in index, return <strong>ESTALE</strong>. This
represents an overlay object that was deleted after its file handle was
encoded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>For a non-directory, instantiate a disconnected overlay dentry from
the decoded underlying dentry, the path type and index inode, if
found.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>For a directory, use the connected underlying decoded dentry, path
type and index, to lookup a connected overlay dentry.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Decoding a non-directory file handle may return a disconnected
dentry. copy_up of that disconnected dentry will create an upper index
entry with no upper alias.</p>
<p>When overlay filesystem has multiple lower layers, a middle layer
directory may have a "redirect" to lower directory. Because middle layer
"redirects" are not indexed, a lower file handle that was encoded from
the "redirect" origin directory, cannot be used to find the middle or
upper layer directory. Similarly, a lower file handle that was encoded
from a descendant of the "redirect" origin directory, cannot be used to
reconstruct a connected overlay path. To mitigate the cases of
directories that cannot be decoded from a lower file handle, these
directories are copied up on encode and encoded as an upper file handle.
On an overlay filesystem with no upper layer this mitigation cannot be
used NFS export in this setup requires turning off redirect follow (e.g.
"<em>redirect_dir=nofollow</em>").</p>
<p>The overlay filesystem does not support non-directory connectable
file handles, so exporting with the <em>subtree_check</em> exportfs
configuration will cause failures to lookup files over NFS.</p>
<p>When the NFS export feature is enabled, all directory index entries
are verified on mount time to check that upper file handles are not
stale. This verification may cause significant overhead in some
cases.</p>
<p>Note: the mount options <em>index=off,nfs_export=on</em> are
conflicting for a read-write mount and will result in an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>xino=</strong>{<strong>on</strong>|<strong>off</strong>|<strong>auto</strong>}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "xino" feature composes a unique object identifier from the real
object st_ino and an underlying fsid index. The "xino" feature uses the
high inode number bits for fsid, because the underlying filesystems
rarely use the high inode number bits. In case the underlying inode
number does overflow into the high xino bits, overlay filesystem will
fall back to the non xino behavior for that inode.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the effect of this option please refer
to
&lt;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html?highlight=overlayfs&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>metacopy=</strong>{<strong>on</strong>|<strong>off</strong>}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When metadata only copy up feature is enabled, overlayfs will only
copy up metadata (as opposed to whole file), when a metadata specific
operation like chown/chmod is performed. Full file will be copied up
later when file is opened for WRITE operation.</p>
<p>In other words, this is delayed data copy up operation and data is
copied up when there is a need to actually modify data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>volatile</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volatile mounts are not guaranteed to survive a crash. It is strongly
recommended that volatile mounts are only used if data written to the
overlay can be recreated without significant effort.</p>
<p>The advantage of mounting with the "volatile" option is that all
forms of sync calls to the upper filesystem are omitted.</p>
<p>In order to avoid a giving a false sense of safety, the syncfs (and
fsync) semantics of volatile mounts are slightly different than that of
the rest of VFS. If any writeback error occurs on the upperdir’s
filesystem after a volatile mount takes place, all sync functions will
return an error. Once this condition is reached, the filesystem will not
recover, and every subsequent sync call will return an error, even if
the upperdir has not experience a new error since the last sync
call.</p>
<p>When overlay is mounted with "volatile" option, the directory
"$workdir/work/incompat/volatile" is created. During next mount, overlay
checks for this directory and refuses to mount if present. This is a
strong indicator that user should throw away upper and work directories
and create fresh one. In very limited cases where the user knows that
the system has not crashed and contents of upperdir are intact, The
"volatile" directory can be removed.</p>

<h2>Mount options for reiserfs</h2>
<p>Reiserfs is a journaling filesystem.</p>
<p><strong>conv</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instructs version 3.6 reiserfs software to mount a version 3.5
filesystem, using the 3.6 format for newly created objects. This
filesystem will no longer be compatible with reiserfs 3.5 tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>hash=</strong>{<strong>rupasov</strong>|<strong>tea</strong>|<strong>r5</strong>|<strong>detect</strong>}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose which hash function reiserfs will use to find files within
directories.</p>
<p><strong>rupasov</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hash invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov. It is fast and preserves
locality, mapping lexicographically close file names to close hash
values. This option should not be used, as it causes a high probability
of hash collisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tea</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Davis-Meyer function implemented by Jeremy Fitzhardinge. It uses
hash permuting bits in the name. It gets high randomness and, therefore,
low probability of hash collisions at some CPU cost. This may be used if
<strong>EHASHCOLLISION</strong> errors are experienced with the r5
hash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>r5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A modified version of the rupasov hash. It is used by default and is
the best choice unless the filesystem has huge directories and unusual
file-name patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>detect</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instructs <strong>mount</strong> to detect which hash function is in
use by examining the filesystem being mounted, and to write this
information into the reiserfs superblock. This is only useful on the
first mount of an old format filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>hashed_relocation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tunes the block allocator. This may provide performance improvements
in some situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>no_unhashed_relocation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tunes the block allocator. This may provide performance improvements
in some situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>noborder</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable the border allocator algorithm invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov.
This may provide performance improvements in some situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nolog</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable journaling. This will provide slight performance improvements
in some situations at the cost of losing reiserfs’s fast recovery from
crashes. Even with this option turned on, reiserfs still performs all
journaling operations, save for actual writes into its journaling area.
Implementation of <em>nolog</em> is a work in progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>notail</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, reiserfs stores small files and 'file tails' directly
into its tree. This confuses some utilities such as
<strong>lilo</strong>(8). This option is used to disable packing of
files into the tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>replayonly</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replay the transactions which are in the journal, but do not actually
mount the filesystem. Mainly used by <em>reiserfsck</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>resize=</strong><em>number</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A remount option which permits online expansion of reiserfs
partitions. Instructs reiserfs to assume that the device has
<em>number</em> blocks. This option is designed for use with devices
which are under logical volume management (LVM). There is a special
<em>resizer</em> utility which can be obtained from
&lt;ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>user_xattr</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable Extended User Attributes. See the <strong>attr</strong>(1)

<p><strong>acl</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable POSIX Access Control Lists. See the <strong>acl</strong>(5)
manual page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>barrier=none</strong> / <strong>barrier=flush</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This disables / enables the use of write barriers in the journaling
code. <strong>barrier=none</strong> disables,
<strong>barrier=flush</strong> enables (default). This also requires an
IO stack which can support barriers, and if reiserfs gets an error on a
barrier write, it will disable barriers again with a warning. Write
barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making
volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance penalty. If
your disks are battery-backed in one way or another, disabling barriers
may safely improve performance.</p>

<p>The following mount options are available:</p>
<p><strong>bulk_read</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable bulk-read. VFS read-ahead is disabled because it slows down
the filesystem. Bulk-Read is an internal optimization. Some flashes may
read faster if the data are read at one go, rather than at several read
requests. For example, OneNAND can do "read-while-load" if it reads more
than one NAND page.</p>

<p><strong>no_bulk_read</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not bulk-read. This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>chk_data_crc</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check data CRC-32 checksums. This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>no_chk_data_crc</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not check data CRC-32 checksums. With this option, the filesystem
does not check CRC-32 checksum for data, but it does check it for the
internal indexing information. This option only affects reading, not
writing. CRC-32 is always calculated when writing the data.</p>

<h1>DM-VERITY SUPPORT</h1>
<p>The device-mapper verity target provides read-only transparent
integrity checking of block devices using kernel crypto API. The
<strong>mount</strong> command can open the dm-verity device and do the
integrity verification before the device filesystem is mounted. Requires
libcryptsetup with in libmount (optionally via
<strong>dlopen</strong>(3)). If libcryptsetup supports extracting the
root hash of an already mounted device, existing devices will be
automatically reused in case of a match. Mount options for
dm-verity:</p>
<p><strong>verity.hashdevice=</strong><em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Path to the hash tree device associated with the source volume to
pass to dm-verity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.roothash=</strong><em>hex</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hex-encoded hash of the root of <em>verity.hashdevice</em>. Mutually
exclusive with <em>verity.roothashfile.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.roothashfile=</strong><em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Path to file containing the hex-encoded hash of the root of
<em>verity.hashdevice.</em> Mutually exclusive with
<em>verity.roothash.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.hashoffset=</strong><em>offset</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the hash tree device is embedded in the source volume,
<em>offset</em> (default: 0) is used by dm-verity to get to the
tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.fecdevice=</strong><em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Path to the Forward Error Correction (FEC) device associated with the
source volume to pass to dm-verity. Optional. Requires kernel built with
<strong>CONFIG_DM_VERITY_FEC</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.fecoffset=</strong><em>offset</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the FEC device is embedded in the source volume, <em>offset</em>
(default: 0) is used by dm-verity to get to the FEC area. Optional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.fecroots=</strong><em>value</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parity bytes for FEC (default: 2). Optional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.roothashsig=</strong><em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Path to <strong>pkcs7</strong>(1ssl) signature of root hash hex
string. Requires crypt_activate_by_signed_key() from cryptsetup and
kernel built with <strong>CONFIG_DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG</strong>.
For device reuse, signatures have to be either used by all mounts of a
device or by none. Optional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verity.oncorruption=</strong><em>ignore</em>|<em>restart</em>|<em>panic</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instruct the kernel to ignore, reboot or panic when corruption is
detected. By default the I/O operation simply fails. Requires Linux 4.1
or newer, and libcrypsetup 2.3.4 or newer. Optional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supported since util-linux v2.35.</p>
<p>For example commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>mksquashfs /etc /tmp/etc.squashfs
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/etc.hash bs=1M count=10
veritysetup format /tmp/etc.squashfs /tmp/etc.hash
openssl smime -sign -in &lt;hash&gt; -nocerts -inkey private.key \
-signer private.crt -noattr -binary -outform der -out /tmp/etc.roothash.p7s
mount -o verity.hashdevice=/tmp/etc.hash,verity.roothash=&lt;hash&gt;,\
verity.roothashsig=/tmp/etc.roothash.p7s /tmp/etc.squashfs /mnt</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>create squashfs image from <em>/etc</em> directory, verity hash
device and mount verified filesystem image to <em>/mnt</em>. The kernel
will verify that the root hash is signed by a key from the kernel
keyring if roothashsig is used.</p>
<h1>LOOP-DEVICE SUPPORT</h1>
<p>One further possible type is a mount via the loop device. For
example, the command</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat -o
loop=/dev/loop3</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>will set up the loop device <em>/dev/loop3</em> to correspond to the
file <em>/tmp/disk.img</em>, and then mount this device on
<em>/mnt</em>.</p>
<p>If no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an option
'<strong>-o loop</strong>' is given), then <strong>mount</strong> will
try to find some unused loop device and use that, for example</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -o loop</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>mount</strong> command <strong>automatically</strong>
creates a loop device from a regular file if a filesystem type is not
specified or the filesystem is known for libblkid, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt</strong></p>
<p><strong>mount -t ext4 /tmp/disk.img /mnt</strong><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This type of mount knows about three options, namely
<strong>loop</strong>, <strong>offset</strong> and
<strong>sizelimit</strong>, that are really options to
<strong>losetup</strong>(8). (These options can be used in addition to
those specific to the filesystem type.)</p>
<p>Since Linux 2.6.25 auto-destruction of loop devices is supported,
meaning that any loop device allocated by <strong>mount</strong> will be
freed by <strong>umount</strong> independently of
<em>/etc/mtab</em>.</p>
<p>You can also free a loop device by hand, using <strong>losetup
-d</strong> or <strong>umount -d</strong>.</p>
<p>Since util-linux v2.29, <strong>mount</strong> re-uses the loop
device rather than initializing a new device if the same backing file is
already used for some loop device with the same offset and sizelimit.
This is necessary to avoid a filesystem corruption.</p>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p><strong>mount</strong> has the following exit status values (the bits
can be ORed):</p>
<p><strong>0</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>success</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>incorrect invocation or permissions</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>system error (out of memory, cannot fork, no more loop devices)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>internal <strong>mount</strong> bug</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>user interrupt</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>16</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>problems writing or locking <em>/etc/mtab</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>32</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>mount failure</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>64</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>some mount succeeded</p>
<p>The command <strong>mount -a</strong> returns 0 (all succeeded), 32
(all failed), or 64 (some failed, some succeeded).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXTERNAL HELPERS</h1>
<p>The syntax of external mount helpers is:</p>
<p><strong>/sbin/mount.</strong><em>suffix</em> <em>spec dir</em>
[<strong>-sfnv</strong>] [<strong>-N</strong> <em>namespace</em>]
[<strong>-o</strong> <em>options</em>] [<strong>-t</strong>
<em>type</em><strong>.</strong><em>subtype</em>]</p>
<p>where the <em>suffix</em> is the filesystem type and the
<strong>-sfnvoN</strong> options have the same meaning as the normal
mount options. The <strong>-t</strong> option is used for filesystems
with subtypes support (for example <strong>/sbin/mount.fuse -t
fuse.sshfs</strong>).</p>
<p>The command <strong>mount</strong> does not pass the mount options
<strong>unbindable</strong>, <strong>runbindable</strong>,
<strong>private</strong>, <strong>rprivate</strong>,
<strong>slave</strong>, <strong>rslave</strong>,
<strong>shared</strong>, <strong>rshared</strong>,
<strong>auto</strong>, <strong>noauto</strong>,
<strong>comment</strong>, <strong>x-</strong>*, <strong>loop</strong>,
<strong>offset</strong> and <strong>sizelimit</strong> to the
mount.&lt;suffix&gt; helpers. All other options are used in a
comma-separated list as an argument to the <strong>-o</strong>
option.</p>

<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>A <strong>mount</strong> command existed in Version 5 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause a crash.</p>
<p>Some Linux filesystems don’t support <strong>-o sync</strong> and
<strong>-o dirsync</strong> (the ext2, ext3, ext4, fat and vfat
filesystems <em>do</em> support synchronous updates (a la BSD) when
mounted with the <strong>sync</strong> option).</p>
<p>The <strong>-o remount</strong> may not be able to change mount
parameters (all <em>ext2fs</em>-specific parameters, except
<strong>sb</strong>, are changeable with a remount, for example, but you
can’t change <strong>gid</strong> or <strong>umask</strong> for the
<em>fatfs</em>).</p>
<p>It is possible that the files <em>/etc/mtab</em> and
<em>/proc/mounts</em> don’t match on systems with a regular
<em>mtab</em> file. The first file is based only on the
<strong>mount</strong> command options, but the content of the second
file also depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g. on a remote
NFS server — in certain cases the <strong>mount</strong> command may
report unreliable information about an NFS mount point and the
<em>/proc/mount</em> file usually contains more reliable information.)
This is another reason to replace the <em>mtab</em> file with a symlink
to the <em>/proc/mounts</em> file.</p>
<p>Checking files on NFS filesystems referenced by file descriptors
(i.e. the <strong>fcntl</strong> and <strong>ioctl</strong> families of
functions) may lead to inconsistent results due to the lack of a
consistency check in the kernel even if the <strong>noac</strong> mount
option is used.</p>
<p>The <strong>loop</strong> option with the <strong>offset</strong> or
<strong>sizelimit</strong> options used may fail when using older
kernels if the <strong>mount</strong> command can’t confirm that the
size of the block device has been configured as requested. This
situation can be worked around by using the <strong>losetup</strong>(8)
command manually before calling <strong>mount</strong> with the
configured loop device.</p>
