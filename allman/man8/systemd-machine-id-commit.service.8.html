<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-machine-id-commit.service - Commit a transient machine ID to
disk</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-machine-id-commit.service</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-machine-id-commit.service is an early boot service
responsible for committing transient /etc/machine-id files to a writable
disk file system. See <strong>machine-id</strong>(5) for more
information about machine IDs.</p>
<p>This service is started after local-fs.target in case /etc/machine-id
is a mount point of its own (usually from a memory file system such as
"tmpfs") and /etc is writable. The service will invoke
<strong>systemd-machine-id-setup --commit</strong>, which writes the
current transient machine ID to disk and unmount the /etc/machine-id
file in a race-free manner to ensure that file is always valid and
accessible for other processes. See
<strong>systemd-machine-id-setup</strong>(1) for details.</p>
<p>The main use case of this service are systems where /etc/machine-id
is read-only and initially not initialized. In this case, the system
manager will generate a transient machine ID file on a memory file
system, and mount it over /etc/machine-id, during the early boot phase.
This service is then invoked in a later boot phase, as soon as /etc/ has
been remounted writable and the ID may thus be committed to disk to make
it permanent.</p>
