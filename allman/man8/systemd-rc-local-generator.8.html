<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-rc-local-generator, rc-local.service - Compatibility
generator and service to start /etc/rc.local during boot</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-rc-local-generator</p>
<p>rc-local.service</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-rc-local-generator</strong> is a generator that
checks whether /etc/rc.local exists and is executable, and if it is,
pulls the rc-local.service unit into the boot process. This unit is
responsible for running this script during late boot. The script is run
after network.target, but in parallel with most other regular system
services.</p>
<p>Note that rc-local.service runs with slightly different semantics
than the original System V version, which was executed "last" in the
boot process, which is a concept that does not translate to systemd.</p>
<p>Also note that rc-local.service is ordered after network.target,
which does not mean that the network is functional, see
<strong>systemd.special</strong>(7). If the script requires a configured
network connection, it may be desirable to pull in and order it after
network-online.target with a drop-in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># /etc/systemd/system/rc-local.service.d/network.conf
[Unit]
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Support for /etc/rc.local is provided for compatibility with specific
System V systems only. However, it is strongly recommended to avoid
making use of this script today, and instead provide proper unit files
with appropriate dependencies for any scripts to run during the boot
process. Note that the path to the script is set at compile time and
varies between distributions.</p>
<p>systemd-rc-local-generator implements
<strong>systemd.generator</strong>(7).</p>
