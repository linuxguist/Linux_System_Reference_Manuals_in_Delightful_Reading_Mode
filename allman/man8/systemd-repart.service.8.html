<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-repart, systemd-repart.service - Automatically grow and add
partitions</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-repart</strong> [OPTIONS...]
[<em>[BLOCKDEVICE]</em>...]</p>
<p>systemd-repart.service</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-repart</strong> grows and adds partitions to a
partition table, based on the configuration files described in
<strong>repart.d</strong>(5).</p>
<p>If invoked with no arguments, it operates on the block device backing
the root file system partition of the running OS, thus growing and
adding partitions of the booted OS image itself. If <em>--image=</em> is
used it will operate on the specified image file. When called in the
initrd it operates on the block device backing /sysroot/ instead, i.e.
on the block device the system will soon transition into. The
systemd-repart.service service is generally run at boot in the initrd,
in order to augment the partition table of the OS before its partitions
are mounted. <strong>systemd-repart</strong> (mostly) operates in a
purely incremental mode: it only grows existing and adds new partitions;
it does not shrink, delete or move existing partitions. The service is
intended to be run on every boot, but when it detects that the partition
table already matches the installed repart.d/*.conf configuration files,
it executes no operation.</p>
<p><strong>systemd-repart</strong> is intended to be used when deploying
OS images, to automatically adjust them to the system they are running
on, during first boot. This way the deployed image can be minimal in
size and may be augmented automatically at boot when needed, taking
possession of disk space available but not yet used. Specifically the
following use cases are among those covered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The root partition may be grown to cover the whole available disk
space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>A /home/, swap or /srv/ partition can be added.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>A second (or third, ...) root partition may be added, to cover A/B
style setups where a second version of the root file system is
alternatingly used for implementing update schemes. The deployed image
would carry only a single partition ("A") but on first boot a second
partition ("B") for this purpose is automatically created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The algorithm executed by <strong>systemd-repart</strong> is roughly
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>The repart.d/*.conf configuration files are loaded and parsed, and
ordered by filename (without the directory prefix). For each
configuration file, drop-in files are looked for in directories with
same name as the configuration file with a suffix ".d" added.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The partition table already existing on the block device is loaded
and parsed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>The existing partitions in the partition table are matched up with
the repart.d/*.conf files by GPT partition type UUID. The first existing
partition of a specific type is assigned the first configuration file
declaring the same type. The second existing partition of a specific
type is then assigned the second configuration file declaring the same
type, and so on. After this iterative assigning is complete any
left-over existing partitions that have no matching configuration file
are considered "foreign" and left as they are. And any configuration
files for which no partition currently exists are understood as a
request to create such a partition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Taking the size constraints and weights declared in the configuration
files into account, all partitions that shall be created are now
allocated to the disk, taking up all free space, always respecting the
size and padding requests. Similarly, existing partitions that should be
grown are grown. New partitions are always appended to the end of the
partition table, taking the first partition table slot whose index is
greater than the indexes of all existing partitions. Partition table
slots are never reordered and thus partition numbers are ensured to
remain stable. Note that this allocation happens in memory only, the
partition table on disk is not updated yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5.</p>
<p>All existing partitions for which configuration files exist and which
currently have no GPT partition label set will be assigned a label,
either explicitly configured in the configuration or — if thats missing
— derived automatically from the partition type. The same is done for
all partitions that are newly created. These assignments are done in
memory only, too, the disk is not updated yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6.</p>
<p>Similarly, all existing partitions for which configuration files
exist and which currently have an all-zero identifying UUID will be
assigned a new UUID. This UUID is cryptographically hashed from a common
seed value together with the partition type UUID (and a counter in case
multiple partitions of the same type are defined), see below. The same
is done for all partitions that are created anew. These assignments are
done in memory only, too, the disk is not updated yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the disks volume UUID is all zeroes it is also
initialized, also cryptographically hashed from the same common seed
value. This is done in memory only too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>8.</p>
<p>The disk space assigned to new partitions (i.e. what was previously
free space) is now erased. Specifically, all file system signatures are
removed, and if the device supports it, the <strong>BLKDISCARD</strong>
I/O control command is issued to inform the hardware that the space is
now empty. In addition any "padding" between partitions and at the end
of the device is similarly erased.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9.</p>
<p>The new partition table is finally written to disk. The kernel is
asked to reread the partition table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As exception to the normally strictly incremental operation, when
called in a special "factory reset" mode,
<strong>systemd-repart</strong> may also be used to erase existing
partitions to reset an installation back to vendor defaults. This mode
of operation is used when either the
<strong>--factory-reset=yes</strong> switch is passed on the tools
command line, or the <strong>systemd.factory_reset=yes</strong> option
specified on the kernel command line, or the <em>FactoryReset</em> EFI
variable (vendor UUID
<strong>8cf2644b-4b0b-428f-9387-6d876050dc67</strong>) is set to "yes".
It alters the algorithm above slightly: between the 3rd and the 4th step
above any partition marked explicitly via the <em>FactoryReset=</em>
boolean is deleted, and the algorithm restarted, thus immediately
re-creating these partitions anew empty.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>systemd-repart</strong> only changes partition
tables, it does not create or resize any file systems within these
partitions. A separate mechanism should be used for that, for example
<strong>systemd-growfs</strong>(8) and
<strong>systemd-makefs</strong>.</p>
<p>The UUIDs identifying the new partitions created (or assigned to
existing partitions that have no UUID yet), as well as the disk as a
whole are hashed cryptographically from a common seed value. This seed
value is usually the <strong>machine-id</strong>(5) of the system, so
that the machine ID reproducibly determines the UUIDs assigned to all
partitions. If the machine ID cannot be read (or the user passes
<strong>--seed=random</strong>, see below) the seed is generated
randomly instead, so that the partition UUIDs are also effectively
random. The seed value may also be set explicitly, formatted as UUID via
the <strong>--seed=</strong> option. By hashing these UUIDs from a
common seed images prepared with this tool become reproducible and the
result of the algorithm above deterministic.</p>
<p>The positional argument should specify the block device to operate
on. Instead of a block device node path a regular file may be specified
too, in which case the command operates on it like it would if a
loopback block device node was specified with the file attached. If
<strong>--empty=create</strong> is specified the specified path is
created as regular file, which is useful for generating disk images from
scratch.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p><strong>--dry-run=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean. If this switch is not specified
<strong>--dry-run=yes</strong> is the implied default. Controls whether
systemd-repart executes the requested re-partition operations or whether
it should only show what it would do. Unless
<strong>--dry-run=no</strong> is specified systemd-repart will not
actually touch the devices partition table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--empty=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes one of "refuse", "allow", "require", "force" or "create".
Controls how to operate on block devices that are entirely empty, i.e.
carry no partition table/disk label yet. If this switch is not specified
the implied default is "refuse".</p>
<p>If "refuse" <strong>systemd-repart</strong> requires that the block
device it shall operate on already carries a partition table and refuses
operation if none is found. If "allow" the command will extend an
existing partition table or create a new one if none exists. If
"require" the command will create a new partition table if none exists
so far, and refuse operation if one already exists. If "force" it will
create a fresh partition table unconditionally, erasing the disk fully
in effect. If "force" no existing partitions will be taken into account
or survive the operation. Hence: use with care, this is a great way to
lose all your data. If "create" a new loopback file is create under the
path passed via the device node parameter, of the size indicated with
<strong>--size=</strong>, see below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--discard=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean. If this switch is not specified
<strong>--discard=yes</strong> is the implied default. Controls whether
to issue the <strong>BLKDISCARD</strong> I/O control command on the
space taken up by any added partitions or on the space in between them.
Usually, its a good idea to issue this request since it tells the
underlying hardware that the covered blocks shall be considered empty,
improving performance. If operating on a regular file instead of a block
device node, a sparse file is generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--size=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a size in bytes, using the usual K, M, G, T suffixes, or the
special value "auto". If used the specified device node path must refer
to a regular file, which is then grown to the specified size if smaller,
before any change is made to the partition table. If specified as "auto"
the minimal size for the disk image is automatically determined (i.e.
the minimal sizes of all partitions are summed up, taking space for
additional metadata into account). This switch is not supported if the
specified node is a block device. This switch has no effect if the file
is already as large as the specified size or larger. The specified size
is implicitly rounded up to multiples of 4096. When used with
<strong>--empty=create</strong> this specifies the initial size of the
loopback file to create.</p>
<p>The <strong>--size=auto</strong> option takes the sizes of
pre-existing partitions into account. However, it does not accommodate
for partition tables that are not tightly packed: the configured
partitions might still not fit into the backing device if empty space
exists between pre-existing partitions (or before the first partition)
that cannot be fully filled by partitions to grow or create.</p>
<p>Also note that the automatic size determination does not take files
or directories specified with <strong>CopyFiles=</strong> into account:
operation might fail if the specified files or directories require more
disk space then the configured per-partition minimal size limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--factory-reset=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes boolean. If this switch is not specified
<strong>--factory=reset=no</strong> is the implied default. Controls
whether to operate in "factory reset" mode, see above. If set to true
this will remove all existing partitions marked with
<em>FactoryReset=</em> set to yes early while executing the
re-partitioning algorithm. Use with care, this is a great way to lose
all your data. Note that partition files need to explicitly turn
<em>FactoryReset=</em> on, as the option defaults to off. If no
partitions are marked for factory reset this switch has no effect. Note
that there are two other methods to request factory reset operation: via
the kernel command line and via an EFI variable, see above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--can-factory-reset</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this switch is specified the disk is not re-partitioned. Instead
it is determined if any existing partitions are marked with
<em>FactoryReset=</em>. If there are the tool will exit with exit status
zero, otherwise non-zero. This switch may be used to quickly determine
whether the running system supports a factory reset mechanism built on
<strong>systemd-repart</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--root=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a directory to use as root file system when searching
for repart.d/*.conf files, for the machine ID file to use as seed and
for the <em>CopyFiles=</em> and <em>CopyBlocks=</em> source files and
directories. By default when invoked on the regular system this defaults
to the hosts root file system /. If invoked from the initrd this
defaults to /sysroot/, so that the tool operates on the configuration
and machine ID stored in the root file system later transitioned into
itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--image=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a disk image file or device to mount and use in a
similar fashion to <strong>--root=</strong>, see above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--seed=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a UUID as argument or the special value
<strong>random</strong>. If a UUID is specified the UUIDs to assign to
partitions and the partition table itself are derived via cryptographic
hashing from it. If not specified it is attempted to read the machine ID
from the host (or more precisely, the root directory configured via
<strong>--root=</strong>) and use it as seed instead, falling back to a
randomized seed otherwise. Use <strong>--seed=random</strong> to force a
randomized seed. Explicitly specifying the seed may be used to generated
strictly reproducible partition tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--pretty=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. If this switch is not specified, it
defaults to on when called from an interactive terminal and off
otherwise. Controls whether to show a user friendly table and graphic
illustrating the changes applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--definitions=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a file system path. If specified the *.conf files are read from
the specified directory instead of searching in
/usr/lib/repart.d/*.conf, /etc/repart.d/*.conf,
/run/repart.d/*.conf.</p>
<p>This parameter can be specified multiple times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--key-file=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a file system path. Configures the encryption key to use when
setting up LUKS2 volumes configured with the <em>Encrypt=key-file</em>
setting in partition files. Should refer to a regular file containing
the key, or an <strong>AF_UNIX</strong> stream socket in the file
system. In the latter case a connection is made to it and the key read
from it. If this switch is not specified the empty key (i.e. zero length
key) is used. This behaviour is useful for setting up encrypted
partitions during early first boot that receive their user-supplied
password only in a later setup step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--private-key=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a file system path. Configures the signing key to use when
creating verity signature partitions with the <em>Verity=signature</em>
setting in partition files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--certificate=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a file system path. Configures the PEM encoded X.509
certificate to use when creating verity signature partitions with the
<em>Verity=signature</em> setting in partition files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-device=</strong>, <strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the TPM2 device and list of PCRs to use for LUKS2 volumes
configured with the <em>Encrypt=tpm2</em> option. These options take the
same parameters as the identically named options to
<strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong>(1) and have the same effect on
partitions where TPM2 enrollment is requested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tpm2-public-key=</strong> [PATH],
<strong>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong> [PCR...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures a TPM2 signed PCR policy to bind encryption to. See
<strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong>(1) for details on these two
options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--split=</strong> [BOOL]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enables generation of split artifacts from partitions configured with
<em>SplitName=</em>. If enabled, for each partition with
<em>SplitName=</em> set, a separate output file containing just the
contents of that partition is generated. The output filename consists of
the loopback filename suffixed with the name configured with
<em>SplitName=</em>. If the loopback filename ends with ".raw", the
suffix is inserted before the ".raw" extension instead.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>--split</strong> is independent from
<strong>--dry-run</strong>. Even if <strong>--dry-run</strong> is
enabled, split artifacts will still be generated from an existing image
if <strong>--split</strong> is enabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-legend</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with
hints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--json=</strong><em>MODE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the
shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace or line
breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.</p>
