<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong> creates, deletes, and cleans up
volatile and temporary files and directories, using the configuration
file format and location specified in <strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5). It
must be invoked with one or more options <strong>--create</strong>,
<strong>--remove</strong>, and <strong>--clean</strong>, to select the
respective subset of operations.</p>
<p>By default, directives from all configuration files are applied. When
invoked with <strong>--replace=</strong><em>PATH</em>, arguments
specified on the command line are used instead of the configuration file
<em>PATH</em>. Otherwise, if one or more absolute filenames are passed
on the command line, only the directives in these files are applied. If
"-" is specified instead of a filename, directives are read from
standard input. If only the basename of a configuration file is
specified, all configuration directories as specified in
<strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5) are searched for a matching file and the
file found that has the highest priority is executed.</p>
<p>System services (systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service,
systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev.service, systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service)
invoke <strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong> to create system files and to
perform system wide cleanup. Those services read
administrator-controlled configuration files in tmpfiles.d/ directories.
User services (systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service,
systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service) also invoke
<strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong>, but it reads a separate set of files,
which includes user-controlled files under ~/.config/user-tmpfiles.d/
and ~/.local/share/user-tmpfiles.d/, and administrator-controlled files
under /usr/share/user-tmpfiles.d/. Users may use this to create and
clean up files under their control, but the system instance performs
global cleanup and is not influenced by user configuration. Note that
this means a time-based cleanup configured in the system instance, such
as the one typically configured for /tmp/, will thus also affect files
created by the user instance if they are placed in /tmp/, even if the
user instances time-based cleanup is turned off.</p>
<p>To re-apply settings after configuration has been modified, simply
restart systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service, which will apply any settings
which can be safely executed at runtime. To debug
<strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong>, it may be useful to invoke it
directly from the command line with increased log level (see
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</em> below).</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p><strong>--create</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this option is passed, all files and directories marked with
<em>f</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>w</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>v</em>,
<em>p</em>, <em>L</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>m</em> in the
configuration files are created or written to. Files and directories
marked with <em>z</em>, <em>Z</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>T</em>, <em>a</em>,
and <em>A</em> have their ownership, access mode and security labels
set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--clean</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this option is passed, all files and directories with an age
parameter configured will be cleaned up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--remove</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this option is passed, the contents of directories marked with
<em>D</em> or <em>R</em>, and files or directories themselves marked
with <em>r</em> or <em>R</em> are removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Execute "user" configuration, i.e. tmpfiles.d files in user
configuration directories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--boot</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also execute lines with an exclamation mark. Lines that are not safe
to be executed on a running system may be marked in this way.
<strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong> is executed in early boot with
<strong>--boot</strong> specified and will execute those lines. When
invoked again later, it should be called without
<strong>--boot</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--prefix=</strong><em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only apply rules with paths that start with the specified prefix.
This option can be specified multiple times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--exclude-prefix=</strong><em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore rules with paths that start with the specified prefix. This
option can be specified multiple times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-E</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shortcut for "--exclude-prefix=/dev --exclude-prefix=/proc
--exclude-prefix=/run --exclude-prefix=/sys", i.e. exclude the
hierarchies typically backed by virtual or memory file systems. This is
useful in combination with <strong>--root=</strong>, if the specified
directory tree contains an OS tree without these virtual/memory file
systems mounted in, as it is typically not desirable to create any files
and directories below these subdirectories if they are supposed to be
overmounted during runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--root=</strong><em>root</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be prefixed
with the given alternate <em>root</em> path, including config search
paths.</p>
<p>When this option is used, the libc Name Service Switch (NSS) is
bypassed for resolving users and groups. Instead the files /etc/passwd
and /etc/group inside the alternate root are read directly. This means
that users/groups not listed in these files will not be resolved, i.e.
LDAP NIS and other complex databases are not considered.</p>
<p>Consider combining this with <strong>-E</strong> to ensure the
invocation does not create files or directories below mount points in
the OS image operated on that are typically overmounted during
runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--image=</strong><em>image</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If specified
all operations are applied to file system in the indicated disk image.
This is similar to <strong>--root=</strong> but operates on file systems
stored in disk images or block devices. The disk image should either
contain just a file system or a set of file systems within a GPT
partition table, following the <strong>Discoverable Partitions
Specification</strong>[1]. For further information on supported disk
images, see <strong>systemd-nspawn</strong>(1)s switch of the same
name.</p>
<p>Implies <strong>-E</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--replace=</strong><em>PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this option is given, one or more positional arguments must be
specified. All configuration files found in the directories listed in
<strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5) will be read, and the configuration given
on the command line will be handled instead of and with the same
priority as the configuration file <em>PATH</em>.</p>
<p>This option is intended to be used when package installation scripts
are running and files belonging to that package are not yet available on
disk, so their contents must be given on the command line, but the admin
configuration might already exist and should be given higher
priority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--cat-config</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copy the contents of config files to standard output. Before each
file, the filename is printed as a comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible to combine <strong>--create</strong>,
<strong>--clean</strong>, and <strong>--remove</strong> in one
invocation (in which case removal and cleanup are executed before
creation of new files). For example, during boot the following command
line is executed to ensure that all temporary and volatile directories
are removed and created according to the configuration file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>systemd-tmpfiles --remove --create</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>CREDENTIALS</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong> supports the service credentials
logic as implemented by <em>LoadCredential=</em>/<em>SetCredential=</em>
(see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(1) for details). The following
credentials are used when passed in:</p>
<p>"tmpfiles.extra"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contents of this credential may contain additional lines to
operate on. The credential contents should follow the same format as any
other tmpfiles.d/ drop-in configuration file. If this credential is
passed it is processed after all of the drop-in files read from the file
system. The lines in the credential can hence augment existing lines of
the OS, but not override them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that by default the systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service unit file
(and related unit files) is set up to inherit the "tmpfiles.extra"
credential from the service manager.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log
level, i.e. less important ones, will be suppressed). Either one of (in
order of decreasing importance) <strong>emerg</strong>,
<strong>alert</strong>, <strong>crit</strong>, <strong>err</strong>,
<strong>warning</strong>, <strong>notice</strong>,
<strong>info</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>, or an integer in the
range 0...7. See <strong>syslog</strong>(3) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored
according to priority.</p>
<p>This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal, because <strong>journalctl</strong>(1) and other tools that
display logs will color messages based on the log level on their
own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a
timestamp.</p>
<p>This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal or a file, because <strong>journalctl</strong>(1) and other
tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on the entry
metadata on their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and
line number in the source code where the message originates.</p>
<p>Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal
entries anyway. Including it directly in the message text can
nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The destination for log messages. One of <strong>console</strong>
(log to the attached tty), <strong>console-prefixed</strong> (log to the
attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility",
see <strong>syslog</strong>(3), <strong>kmsg</strong> (log to the kernel
circular log buffer), <strong>journal</strong> (log to the journal),
<strong>journal-or-kmsg</strong> (log to the journal if available, and
to kmsg otherwise), <strong>auto</strong> (determine the appropriate log
target automatically, the default), <strong>null</strong> (disable log
output).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pager to use when <strong>--no-pager</strong> is not given; overrides
<em>$PAGER</em>. If neither <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> nor <em>$PAGER</em>
are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn,
including <strong>less</strong>(1) and <strong>more</strong>(1), until
one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is
invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the
value "cat" is equivalent to passing <strong>--no-pager</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: if <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set,
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> (as well as <em>$PAGER</em>) will be silently
ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the options passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default
"FRSXMK").</p>
<p>Users might want to change two options in particular:</p>
<p><strong>K</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is
pressed. To allow <strong>less</strong> to handle Ctrl+C itself to
switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.</p>
<p>If the value of <em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em> does not include "K", and the
pager that is invoked is <strong>less</strong>, Ctrl+C will be ignored
by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>X</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization
and deinitialization strings to the terminal. It is set by default to
allow command output to remain visible in the terminal even after the
pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from
working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the
mouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <strong>less</strong>(1) for more discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the charset passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default
"utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8
compatible).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager
is enabled; if false, disabled. If <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not
set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same
as the owner of the login session, see <strong>geteuid</strong>(2) and
<strong>sd_pid_get_owner_uid</strong>(3). In secure mode,
<strong>LESSSECURE=1</strong> will be set when invoking the pager, and
the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start
new subprocesses. When <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set at all,
pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used.
(Currently only <strong>less</strong>(1) implements secure mode.)</p>
<p>Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example
under <strong>sudo</strong>(8) or <strong>pkexec</strong>(1), care must
be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled.
"Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as describe
above. Setting <em>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</em> or not removing it from
the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands.
Note that if the <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> or <em>$PAGER</em> variables
are to be honoured, <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> must be set too. It
might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using
<strong>--no-pager</strong> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, <strong>systemd</strong> and
related utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the output
will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the
following special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to
the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to
override the automatic decision based on <em>$TERM</em> and what the
console is connected to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should
be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This
can be specified to override the decision that <strong>systemd</strong>
makes based on <em>$TERM</em> and other conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>UNPRIVILEGED --CLEANUP OPERATION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong> tries to avoid changing the access
and modification times on the directories it accesses, which requires
<strong>CAP_FOWNER</strong> privileges. When running as non-root,
directories which are checked for files to clean up will have their
access time bumped, which might prevent their cleanup.</p>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>On success, 0 is returned. If the configuration was syntactically
invalid (syntax errors, missing arguments, ...), so some lines had to be
ignored, but no other errors occurred, <strong>65</strong> is returned
(<strong>EX_DATAERR</strong> from /usr/include/sysexits.h). If the
configuration was syntactically valid, but could not be executed (lack
of permissions, creation of files in missing directories, invalid
contents when writing to /sys/ values, ...), <strong>73</strong> is
returned (<strong>EX_CANTCREAT</strong> from /usr/include/sysexits.h).
Otherwise, <strong>1</strong> is returned (<strong>EXIT_FAILURE</strong>
from /usr/include/stdlib.h).</p>
<p>Note: when creating items, if the target already exists, but is of
the wrong type or otherwise does not match the requested state, and
forced operation has not been requested with "+", a message is emitted,
but the failure is otherwise ignored.</p>
