<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>boltd - thunderbolt device managing system daemon</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>boltd</strong> [<em>OPTIONS</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>boltd is the thunderbolt device manager daemon. Its goal is to enable
the secure and convenient use of thunderbolt devices by using the
security features of modern thunderbolt controllers. It provides the
org.freedesktop.bolt name on the system bus. boltd is autostarted via
systemd/udev if a thunderbolt device is connected.</p>
<p>The thunderbolt I/O technology works by bridging PCIe between the
controllers on each end of the connection, which in turn means that
devices connected via Thunderbolt are ultimately connected via PCIe.
Therefore thunderbolt can achieve very high connection speeds, fast
enough to even drive external graphics cards. The downside is that it
also makes certain attacks possible. To mitigate these security
problems, the latest version — known as Thunderbolt 3 — supports
different <strong>security levels</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>none</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No security. The behavior is identical to previous Thunderbolt
versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>dponly</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No PCIe tunnels are created at all, but DisplayPort tunnels are
allowed and will work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Connected devices must be authorized by the user. Only then will the
PCIe tunnels be activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>secure</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically the same as user mode, but additionally a key will be
written to the device the first time the device is connected. This key
will then be used to verify the identity of the connected device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>usbonly</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One PCIe tunnel is created to a usb controller in a thunderbolt dock;
no other downstream PCIe tunnels are authorized (needs 4.17 kernel and
recent hardware).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary task of <strong>boltd</strong> is to authorize
thunderbolt peripherals if the security level is either user or secure.
It provides a D-Bus API to list devices, enroll them (authorize and
store them in the local database) and forget them again (remove
previously enrolled devices). It also emits signals if new devices are
connected (or removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be
automatically authorized as soon as they are connected. A command line
tool, called boltctl(1), can be used to control the daemon and perform
all the above mentioned tasks.</p>
<p>The pre-boot access control list (<strong>BootACL</strong>) feature
is active when supported by the firmware and when <em>boltd</em> is
running on a new enough Linux kernel (&gt;= 4.17). The <em>BootACL</em>
is a list of UUIDs, that can be written to the thunderbolt controller.
If enabled in the BIOS, all devices in that list will be authorized by
the firmware during pre-boot, which means these devices can be used in
the BIOS setup and also during Linux early boot. NB: <strong>no device
verification</strong> is done, even when the security level is set to
<em>secure</em> mode in the BIOS, i.e. the maximal effective security
level for devices in the <em>BootACL</em> is only <em>user</em>. If
<em>BootACL</em> support is present, all new devices will be
automatically added. Devices that are <em>forgotten</em> (removed from
<em>boltd</em>) will also be removed from the <em>BootACL</em>. When a
controller is offline, changes to the <em>BootACL</em> will be written
to a journal and synchronized back when the controller is online
again.</p>
<p><em>IOMMU</em> support: if the hardware and firmware support using
the input–output memory management unit (IOMMU) to restrict direct
memory access to certain safe regions, boltd will detect that feature
and change its behavior: As long as iommu support is active, as
indicated by the iommu_dma_protection sysfs attribute of the domain
controller, new devices will be automatically enrolled with the
<em>iommu</em> policy and existing devices with <em>iommu</em> (or
<em>auto</em>) policy will be automatically authorized by boltd without
any user interaction. When iommu is not active, devices that were
enrolled with the <em>iommu</em> policy will not be authorized
automatically. The status of iommu support can be inspected by using
<strong>boltctl domains</strong>.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-h, --help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prints a short help text and exits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows the version number and exits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-r, --replace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replace the currently running boltd instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--journal</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Force logging to the journal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>-v, --verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print debug output.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p><strong>RUNTIME_DIRECTORY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the path where the daemon stores data that only has to live
as long as the current boot. Will be set automatically when started via
systemd (&gt;= 240). If not set the default path for runtime data is
<em>/run/boltd</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>STATE_DIRECTORY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the path where the daemon stores device information,
including the keys used for authorization. Overwrites the path that was
set at compile time. Will be set automatically when started via systemd
(&gt;= 240).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BOLT_DBPATH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as STATE_DIRECTORY but takes precedence over that, if set.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>On success 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.</p>
