<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>MPTCP is a transport protocol built on top of TCP that allows TCP
connections to use multiple paths to maximize resource usage and
increase redundancy. The ip-mptcp sub-commands allow configuring several
aspects of the MPTCP path manager, which is in charge of subflows
creation:</p>
<p>The <strong>endpoint</strong> object specifies the IP addresses that
will be used and/or announced for additional subflows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">ip mptcp endpoint add</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">add new MPTCP endpoint</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">ip mptcp endpoint delete</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">delete existing MPTCP endpoint</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">ip mptcp endpoint show</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">get existing MPTCP endpoint</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">ip mptcp endpoint flush</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">flush all existing MPTCP endpoints</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<dl>
<dt><em>IFADDR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>An IPv4 or IPv6 address. When used with the <strong>delete
id</strong> operation, an <strong>IFADDR</strong> is only included when
the <strong>ID</strong> is 0.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><em>PORT</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a port number is specified, incoming MPTCP subflows for already
established MPTCP sockets will be accepted on the specified port,
regardless the original listener port accepting the first MPTCP subflow
and/or this peer being actually on the client side.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><em>ID</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a unique numeric identifier for the given endpoint</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>signal</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The endpoint will be announced/signaled to each peer via an MPTCP
ADD_ADDR sub-option. Upon reception of an ADD_ADDR sub-option, the peer
can try to create additional subflows, see
<strong>ADD_ADDR_ACCEPTED_NR.</strong></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>subflow</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If additional subflow creation is allowed by the MPTCP limits, the
MPTCP path manager will try to create an additional subflow using this
endpoint as the source address after the MPTCP connection is
established.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>backup</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is a <strong>subflow</strong> endpoint, the subflows created
using this endpoint will have the backup flag set during the connection
process. This flag instructs the peer to only send data on a given
subflow when all non-backup subflows are unavailable. This does not
affect outgoing data, where subflow priority is determined by the
backup/non-backup flag received from the peer</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>fullmesh</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is a <strong>subflow</strong> endpoint and additional subflow
creation is allowed by the MPTCP limits, the MPTCP path manager will try
to create an additional subflow for each known peer address, using this
endpoint as the source address. This will occur after the MPTCP
connection is established. If the peer did not announce any additional
addresses using the MPTCP ADD_ADDR sub-option, this will behave the same
as a plain <strong>subflow</strong> endpoint. When the peer does
announce addresses, each received ADD_ADDR sub-option will trigger
creation of an additional subflow to generate a full mesh topology.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>limits</strong> object specifies the constraints for
subflow creations:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">ip mptcp limits show</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">get current MPTCP subflow creation
limits</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">ip mptcp limits set</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">change the MPTCP subflow creation
limits</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<dl>
<dt><em>SUBFLOW_NR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>specifies the maximum number of additional subflows allowed for each
MPTCP connection. Additional subflows can be created due to: incoming
accepted ADD_ADDR sub-option, local <strong>subflow</strong> endpoints,
additional subflows started by the peer.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><em>ADD_ADDR_ACCEPTED_NR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>specifies the maximum number of incoming ADD_ADDR sub-options
accepted for each MPTCP connection. After receiving the specified number
of ADD_ADDR sub-options, any other incoming one will be ignored for the
MPTCP connection lifetime. When an ADD_ADDR sub-option is accepted and
there are no local <em>fullmesh</em> endpoints, the MPTCP path manager
will try to create a new subflow using the address in the ADD_ADDR
sub-option as the destination address and a source address determined
using local routing resolution When <em>fullmesh</em> endpoints are
available, the MPTCP path manager will try to create new subflows using
each <em>fullmesh</em> endpoint as a source address and the peer's
ADD_ADDR address as the destination. In both cases the
<em>SUBFLOW_NR</em> limit is enforced.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>monitor</strong> displays creation and deletion of MPTCP
connections as well as addition or removal of remote addresses and
subflows.</p>
