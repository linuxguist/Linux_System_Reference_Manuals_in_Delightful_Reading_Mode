<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-fsck@.service, systemd-fsck-root.service,
systemd-fsck-usr.service, systemd-fsck - File system checker logic</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-fsck@.service</p>
<p>systemd-fsck-root.service</p>
<p>systemd-fsck-usr.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-fsck</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-fsck@.service, systemd-fsck-root.service, and
systemd-fsck-usr.service are services responsible for file system
checks. They are instantiated for each device that is configured for
file system checking. systemd-fsck-root.service and
systemd-fsck-usr.service are responsible for file system checks on the
root and /usr file system, respectively, but only if the root filesystem
was not checked in the initrd. systemd-fsck@.service is used for all
other file systems and for the root file system in the initrd.</p>
<p>These services are started at boot if <strong>passno</strong> in
/etc/fstab for the file system is set to a value greater than zero, but
only if it is also configured to be mounted at boot (i.e. without
"noauto" option). The file system check for root is performed before the
other file systems. Other file systems may be checked in parallel,
except when they are on the same rotating disk.</p>
<p>systemd-fsck does not know any details about specific filesystems,
and simply executes file system checkers specific to each filesystem
type (fsck.<em>type</em>). These checkers will decide if the filesystem
should actually be checked based on the time since last check, number of
mounts, unclean unmount, etc.</p>
<p>systemd-fsck-root.service and systemd-fsck-usr.service will activate
reboot.target if fsck returns the "System should reboot" condition, or
emergency.target if fsck returns the "Filesystem errors left
uncorrected" condition.</p>
<p>systemd-fsck@.service will fail if fsck returns with either "System
should reboot" or "Filesystem errors left uncorrected" conditions. For
filesystems listed in /etc/fstab without "nofail" or "noauto" options,
"local-fs.target" will then activate emergency.target.</p>
<h1>KERNEL COMMAND LINE</h1>
<p>systemd-fsck understands these kernel command line parameters:</p>
<p><em>fsck.mode=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of "auto", "force", "skip". Controls the mode of operation. The
default is "auto", and ensures that file system checks are done when the
file system checker deems them necessary. "force" unconditionally
results in full file system checks. "skip" skips any file system
checks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>fsck.repair=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of "preen", "yes", "no". Controls the mode of operation. The
default is "preen", and will automatically repair problems that can be
safely fixed. "yes" will answer yes to all questions by fsck and "no"
will answer no to all questions.</p>
