<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>NetworkManager - network management daemon</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>NetworkManager</strong> <strong>[OPTIONS...]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking configuration
and operation as painless and automatic as possible by managing the
primary network connection and other network interfaces, like Ethernet,
Wi-Fi, and Mobile Broadband devices. NetworkManager will connect any
network device when a connection for that device becomes available,
unless that behavior is disabled. Information about networking is
exported via a D-Bus interface to any interested application, providing
a rich API with which to inspect and control network settings and
operation.</p>
<h1>DISPATCHER SCRIPTS</h1>
<p>NetworkManager-dispatcher service can execute scripts for the user in
response to network events. See
<strong>NetworkManager-dispatcher</strong>(8) manual.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p><strong>--version</strong> | <strong>-V</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print the NetworkManager software version and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--help</strong> | <strong>-h</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print NetworkManagers available options and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--no-daemon</strong> | <strong>-n</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not daemonize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--debug</strong> | <strong>-d</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not daemonize, and direct log output to the controlling terminal
in addition to syslog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--pid-file</strong> | <strong>-p</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify location of a PID file. The PID file is used for storing PID
of the running process and prevents running multiple instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--state-file</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify file for storing state of the NetworkManager persistently. If
not specified, the default value of
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--config</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify configuration file to set up various settings for
NetworkManager. If not specified, the default value of
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is used with a fallback to the
older nm-system-settings.conf if located in the same directory. See
<strong>NetworkManager.conf</strong>(5) for more information on
configuration file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--configure-and-quit</strong> [initrd]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quit after all devices reach a stable state. The optional initrd
parameter enables mode, where no processes are left running after
NetworkManager stops, which is useful for running from an initial
ramdisk on rearly boot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--plugins</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>List plugins used to manage system-wide connection settings. This
list has preference over plugins specified in the configuration file.
See main.plugins setting in <strong>NetworkManager.conf</strong>(5) for
supported options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--log-level</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets how much information NetworkManager sends to the log destination
(usually syslogs "daemon" facility). By default, only informational,
warning, and error messages are logged. See the section on logging in
<strong>NetworkManager.conf</strong>(5) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--log-domains</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma-separated list specifying which operations are logged to the
log destination (usually syslog). By default, most domains are
logging-enabled. See the section on logging in
<strong>NetworkManager.conf</strong>(5) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--print-config</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print the NetworkManager configuration to stdout and exit. See
<strong>NetworkManager.conf</strong>(5). This does not include
connection profiles. View them with <strong>nmcli
connection</strong>.</p>
<p>This reads configuration files from disk. If NetworkManager is
currently running, make sure that it has the same configuration
loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>UDEV PROPERTIES</h1>
<p><strong>udev</strong>(7) device manager is used for the network
device discovery. The following property influences how NetworkManager
manages the devices:</p>
<p><em>NM_UNMANAGED</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to "1" or "true", the device is configured as unmanaged by
NetworkManager. Note that the user still can explicitly overrule this
configuration via means like <strong>nmcli device set "$DEVICE" managed
yes</strong> or "device*.managed=1" in NetworkManager.conf.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>SIGNALS</h1>
<p>NetworkManager process handles the following signals:</p>
<p><em>SIGHUP</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The signal causes a reload of NetworkManagers configuration. Note
that not all configuration parameters can be changed at runtime and
therefore some changes may be applied only after the next restart of the
daemon. A SIGHUP also involves further reloading actions, like doing a
DNS update and restarting the DNS plugin. The latter can be useful for
example when using the dnsmasq plugin and changing its configuration in
/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d. However, it also means this will shortly
interrupt name resolution. In the future, there may be further actions
added. A SIGHUP means to update NetworkManager configuration and reload
everything that is supported. Note that this does not reload connections
from disk. For that there is a D-Bus API and nmclis reload action</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SIGUSR1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The signal forces a rewrite of DNS configuration. Contrary to SIGHUP,
this does not restart the DNS plugin and will not interrupt name
resolution. When NetworkManager is not managing DNS, the signal forces a
restart of operations that depend on the DNS configuration (like the
resolution of the system hostname via reverse DNS, or the resolution of
WireGuard peers); therefore, it can be used to tell NetworkManager that
the content of resolv.conf was changed externally. In the future,
further actions may be added. A SIGUSR1 means to write out data like
resolv.conf, or refresh a cache. It is a subset of what is done for
SIGHUP without reloading configuration from disk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SIGUSR2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The signal has no effect at the moment but is reserved for future
use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An alternative to a signal to reload configuration is the Reload
D-Bus call. It allows for more fine-grained selection of what to reload,
it only returns after the reload is complete, and it is guarded by
PolicyKit.</p>
<h1>DEBUGGING</h1>
<p>NetworkManager only configures your system. So when your networking
setup doesnt work as expected, the first step is to look at your system
to understand what is actually configured, and whether that is correct.
The second step is to find out how to tell NetworkManager to do the
right thing.</p>
<p>You can for example try to <strong>ping</strong> hosts (by IP address
or DNS name), look at <strong>ip link show</strong>, <strong>ip address
show</strong> and <strong>ip route show</strong>, and look at
/etc/resolv.conf for name resolution issues. Also look at the connection
profiles that you have configured in NetworkManager (<strong>nmcli
connection</strong> and <strong>nmcli connection show
"$PROFILE"</strong>) and the configured interfaces (<strong>nmcli
device</strong>).</p>
<p>If that does not suffice, look at the logfiles of NetworkManager.
NetworkManager logs to syslog, so depending on your system configuration
you can call <strong>journalctl</strong> to get the logs. By default,
NetworkManager logs are not verbose and thus not very helpful for
investigating a problem in detail. You can change the logging level at
runtime with <strong>nmcli general logging level TRACE domains
ALL</strong>. But usually a better way is to collect full logs from the
start, by configuring level=TRACE in NetworkManager.conf. See
<strong>NetworkManager.conf</strong>(5) manual. Note that trace logs of
NetworkManager are verbose and systemd-journald might rate limit some
lines. Possibly disable rate limiting first with the
RateLimitIntervalSec and RateLimitBurst options of journald (see
<strong>journald.conf</strong>(5) manual).</p>
<p>NetworkManager does not log any secrets. However, you are advised to
check whether anything private sensitive gets logged before posting.
When reporting an issue, provide complete logs and avoid modifications
(for privacy) that distort the meaning.</p>
<h1>/VAR/LIB/NETWORKMANAGER/SECRET_KEY AND /ETC/MACHINE-ID</h1>
<p>The identity of a machine is important as various settings depend on
it. For example, ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable and
ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable generate identifiers by hashing the
machines identity. See also the connection.stable-id connection property
which is a per-profile seed that gets hashed with the machine identity
for generating such addresses and identifiers.</p>
<p>If you backup and restore a machine, the identity of the machine
probably should be preserved. In that case, preserve the files
/var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key and /etc/machine-id. On the other
hand, if you clone a virtual machine, you probably want that the clone
has a different identity. There is already existing tooling on Linux for
handling /etc/machine-id (see <strong>machine-id</strong>(5)).</p>
<p>The identity of the machine is determined by the
/var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key. If such a file does not exist,
NetworkManager will create a file with random content. To generate a new
identity just delete the file and after restart a new file will be
created. The file should be read-only to root and contain at least 16
bytes that will be used to seed the various places where a stable
identifier is used.</p>
<p>Since 1.16.0, NetworkManager supports a version 2 of secret-keys. For
such keys /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key starts with ASCII "nm-v2:"
followed by at least 32 bytes of random data. Also, recent versions of
NetworkManager always create such kinds of secret-keys, when the file
does not yet exist. With version 2 of the secret-key, /etc/machine-id is
also hashed as part of the generation for addresses and identifiers. The
advantage is that you can keep /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key
stable, and only regenerate /etc/machine-id when cloning a VM.</p>
