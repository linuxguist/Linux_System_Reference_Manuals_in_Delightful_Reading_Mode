<p>im-config - set up input method framework configuration</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>im-config [OPTION]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-a</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List all; force to list all possible input method frameworks in menu
or STDOUT even if any associated packages are not installed on the
system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-c</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use console dialogue.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-x</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use X dialogue with zenity.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-s</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do not
actually change configuration files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-l</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List all available input method frameworks to STDOUT. Unless
<strong>-a</strong> is used, list only ones with associated packages
installed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-m</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List configuration values to STDOUT:</p>
<p>·</p>
<p>active configuration (system)</p>
<p>·</p>
<p>active configuration (user)</p>
<p>·</p>
<p>automatic configuration for the current locale</p>
<p>·</p>
<p>override configuration for the current locale</p>
<p>·</p>
<p>automatic configuration for most locales</p>
<p>If the active configuration is <strong>custom</strong>, the user made
a custom configuration and im-config should not change it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-n</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em></p>
<p>Set input method framework to <em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em>.
This option is for other configuration tool to set the input method.
Since the default value of <em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em> is "auto"
or "cjkv", you usually do not need to use this from other configuration
script.</p>
<p>Specifying invalid <em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em> causes the
error exit. Updating the configuration file which was not updated by
<strong>im-config</strong> also causes the error exit.</p>
<p>When this <em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em> is "none" then do not
activate any IM from <strong>im-config</strong> and use desktop
default.</p>
<p>When this <em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em> is "REMOVE" then it
always removes the configuration file even if it was not updated by
<strong>im-config</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-o</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em></p>
<p>Print the localized description of the input method <em>&lt;input
method name&gt;</em> to STDOUT.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>-l</strong>, <strong>-m</strong>, <strong>-n</strong>,
and <strong>-o</strong> options are meant to be API for other programs
to control the im-config.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This manual page very briefly documents <strong>im-config</strong>
and the configuration of the input method.</p>
<p><strong>im-config</strong> provides the framework to configure the
input method framework on GUI system (Wayland or original X Window) with
its GUI or console terminal dialogue. If this is invoked without option,
this lists available input methods as its choice while marking automatic
choice with trailing @-mark. The listing is ordered by the priority of
the input method framework. The input method framework with the highest
priority comes first. The availability of the input method frameworks
are judged by the installation of the input method framework packages.
After you make a choice for the input method framework, this displays a
guidance for associated input method engine packages which enables to
input non-latin characters specific to the need of some languages to be
installed.</p>
<p>The activation of input method engines are out of scope for
<strong>im-config</strong>. You need to activate them using the
mechanism offered by the deployed input method framework. For GNOME
Desktop which normally uses ibus as its input method framework, activate
input method engines by "Setting" -&gt; "Keyboard" -&gt; "Input Sources"
and click "+"-sign. For other Desktop environments, you should see
something like a small tray icon for the input method framework which
can be used to activate input method engines.</p>
<p>If only a set of required input method packages along with the
im-config package is installed, you do not need to use this command.
Such a installation works well in its default and there is no need to
use this command. When you wish to have multiple input method frameworks
installed and wish to switch among them, you need to use this
command.</p>
<p>If you have no idea for what package to install,
<strong>im-config</strong> invoked with both <strong>-a</strong> and
<strong>-s</strong> is a good start.</p>
<p>This input method is the essential mechanism for Japanese, Chinese
and Korean (CJK) languages to enter their non-ASCII native characters.
This is also useful to support specialized keyboard bindings for other
non-European languages such as Indic and other Asian languages.</p>
<p>Input method frameworks such as IBus, fcitx5, and uim support not
only one of these CJK languages but support almost all languages
simultaneously by dynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI on the
fly.</p>
<p>The im-config package installs a hook script
<strong>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-config_launch</strong>. At session
start it sources this file as a POSIX shell code. Then this hook script
tries to source the user configuration file
<strong>~/.xinputrc</strong>, if it exists. Otherwise, this hook script
sources the system configuration file
<strong>/etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc</strong>.</p>
<p>The im-config package also installs another hook script
<strong>/etc/profile.d/im-config_wayland.sh</strong> and a desktop file
<strong>/usr/share/applications/im-config.desktop</strong>. When a
desktop system starts under wayland, it uses these files instead. Then
this hook script and the desktop file tries to source the user
configuration file <strong>~/.xinputrc</strong>, if it exists.
Otherwise, this hook script sources the system configuration file
<strong>/etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>im-config</strong> invoked from a user account updates the
user configuration file <strong>~/.xinputrc</strong>.
<strong>im-config</strong> invoked from the root account updates the
system configuration file <strong>~/etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc</strong>. The
essential contents of generated files are:</p>
<p><strong>run_im <em>&lt;input</em> method name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>When these files are sourced, the <strong>run_im</strong> shell
function instructs to source the initialization code for the
corresponding input method. This initialization code is defined in the
<em>&lt;2 digits number&gt;</em>_<em>&lt;input method</em>
name&gt;.<strong>rc</strong> file in
<strong>/usr/share/im-config/data</strong>.</p>
<p>The im-config hook script,
<strong>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-config_launch</strong>, exports
following variables to programs: $XMODIFIERS, $GTK_IM_MODULE,
$QT_IM_MODULE, and $CLUTTER_IM_MODULE.</p>
<p>The im-config hook script,
<strong>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-config_launch</strong>, also set
$STARTUP to use <strong>/usr/bin/im-launch</strong> for starting
required daemons.</p>
<p>If you wish to create a custom configuration beyond what
<strong>im-config</strong> can do for you, please copy one of these
initialization code files into <strong>~/.xinputrc</strong> or
<strong>/etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc</strong> and edit it to suite your need.
For example, <strong>02_cjkv.rc</strong> tells how input method can be
customized for each locale. This script should be written to set
environment variables if "$IM_CONFIG_PHASE" = 1 and to start daemon
programs if "$IM_CONFIG_PHASE" = 2 .</p>
<p>Please note that this <em>&lt;2 digits number&gt;</em> part of these
configuration files may change for every new releases of the im-config
package.</p>
<p>When a user makes manual changes to <strong>~/.xinputrc</strong> or
<strong>/etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc</strong> without using
<strong>im-config</strong>, <strong>im-config</strong> will detect it
using a md5sum hush value embedded in the shell comment and will not
overwrite such files. You must erase them manually if you wish to
replace them with ones created by <strong>im-config</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>&lt;2 digits number&gt;</em>_<em>&lt;input method
name&gt;</em>.<strong>conf</strong> files in
<strong>/usr/share/im-config/data</strong> provide the UI data for
<strong>im-config</strong> and the heuristic logic of selecting
desirable input method under the auto mode. The smaller number of the
<em>&lt;2 digits number&gt;</em> indicates the higher priority of
<em>&lt;input method name&gt;</em>.</p>
<p>These <em>&lt;2 digits number&gt;</em>_<em>&lt;input method
name&gt;</em>.<strong>conf</strong> files define few variables and
functions. The value of <strong>IM_CONFIG_SHORT</strong> is the short
description of the input method for the menu. The value of
<strong>IM_CONFIG_LONG</strong> is the long description of the input
method explaining its package dependency. The
<strong>package_menu</strong> shell function defines as a function to
return true if any associated input method packages are installed to
activate its menu entry. The <strong>package_auto</strong> shell
function defines as a function to return true if the sufficient input
method packages are installed for the auto mode. These definitions use
the <strong>package_status</strong> shell function which takes package
name as its argument and returns true if it is installed properly.</p>
<p>The menu lists input methods with the <em>&lt;2 digits
number&gt;</em> between <strong>00</strong> and <strong>89</strong>. The
auto mode considers its input method candidate from <em>&lt;2</em>
digits number&gt; between <strong>10</strong> and <strong>79</strong> in
this order. The usage convention of <em>&lt;2 digits number&gt;</em>
is:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>00-09:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Input Method choice mode (default/auto/cjkv/REMOVE)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>10-49:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Input Method supporting multiple languages.(auto ready)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>50-79:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Input Method supporting limited languages. (auto ready)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>80-89:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Input Method (deprecated one) (not for auto)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>90-99:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Used internally by <strong>im-config</strong> (not for auto)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This structure ensures to have different input methods to be
installed side-by-side with minimal user configurations.</p>
<h1>TROUBLESHOOT</h1>
<p>If you have any problem, see the first part of
<strong>~/.xsession-errors</strong> and look for the cause. If you are
running <strong>im-config</strong> while Debian (sid) system is
undergoing a major library transition, you may need to manually set up
<strong>~/.xinputrc</strong> with adjusted library version number etc.
Please file a bug report to the im-config package using reportbug(1)
describing your resolution experience.</p>
