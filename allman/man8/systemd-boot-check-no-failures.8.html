<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-boot-check-no-failures.service,
systemd-boot-check-no-failures - verify that the system booted up
cleanly</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-boot-check-no-failures.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/system-boot-check-no-failures</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-boot-check-no-failures.service is a system service that
checks whether the system booted up successfully. This service
implements a very minimal test only: whether there are any failed units
on the system. This service is disabled by default. When enabled, it is
ordered before boot-complete.target, thus ensuring the target cannot be
reached when the system booted up with failed services.</p>
<p>Note that due the simple nature of this check this service is
probably not suitable for deployment in most scenarios. It is primarily
useful only as example for developing more fine-grained checks to order
before boot-complete.target.</p>
