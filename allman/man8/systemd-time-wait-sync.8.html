<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-time-wait-sync.service, systemd-time-wait-sync - Wait until
kernel time is synchronized</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>systemd-time-wait-sync.service</p>
<p>/lib/systemd/systemd-time-wait-sync</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>systemd-time-wait-sync is a system service that delays the start of
units that are ordered after time-sync.target (see
<strong>systemd.special</strong>(7) for details) until the system time
has been synchronized with an accurate remote reference time source by
systemd-timesyncd.service.</p>
<p>systemd-timesyncd.service notifies systemd-time-wait-sync about
successful synchronization. systemd-time-wait-sync also tries to detect
when the kernel marks the system clock as synchronized, but this
detection is not reliable and is intended only as a fallback for
compatibility with alternative NTP services that can be used to
synchronize time (e.g., ntpd, chronyd).</p>
