<p><strong>anacron [<strong>-s</strong>] [<strong>-f</strong>]
[<strong>-n</strong>] [<strong>-d</strong>]
[<strong>-q</strong>]</strong> [<strong>-t anacrontab</strong>]
[<strong>-S spooldir</strong>] [<em>job</em>] ...<br />

<strong>anacron [<strong>-V</strong>|<strong>-h</strong>]</strong><br />
<strong>anacron -T [<strong>-t</strong> anacrontab]</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Anacron can be used to execute commands periodically, with a
frequency specified in days. Unlike <strong>cron(8)</strong>, it does
not assume that the machine is running continuously. Hence, it can be
used on machines that aren't running 24 hours a day, to control daily,
weekly, and monthly jobs that are usually controlled by
<strong>cron</strong>.</p>
<p>When executed, Anacron reads a list of jobs from a configuration
file, normally <em>/etc/anacrontab</em> (see
<strong>anacrontab(5)</strong>). This file contains the list of jobs
that Anacron controls. Each job entry specifies a period in days, a
delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and a shell command.</p>
<p>For each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been executed in
the last n days, where n is the period specified for that job. If not,
Anacron runs the job's shell command, after waiting for the number of
minutes specified as the delay parameter.</p>
<p>After the command exits, Anacron records the date in a special
timestamp file for that job, so it can know when to execute it again.
Only the date is used for the time calculations. The hour is not
used.</p>
<p>When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron exits.</p>
<p>Anacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as specified in the
<em>anacrontab</em> matches any of the <em>job</em> command-line
arguments. The <em>job</em> arguments can be shell wildcard patterns (be
sure to protect them from your shell with adequate quoting). Specifying
no <em>job</em> arguments, is equivalent to specifying "*" (That is, all
jobs will be considered).</p>
<p>Unless the <strong>-d</strong> option is given (see below), Anacron
forks to the background when it starts, and the parent process exits
immediately.</p>
<p>Unless the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-n</strong> options are
given, Anacron starts jobs immediately when their delay is over. The
execution of different jobs is completely independent.</p>
<p>If a job generates any output on its standard output or standard
error, the output is mailed to the user running Anacron (usually root),
or to the address contained by the MAILTO environment variable in the
crontab, if such exists.</p>
<p>Informative messages about what Anacron is doing are sent to
<strong>syslogd(8)</strong> under facility <strong>cron</strong>,
priority <strong>notice</strong>. Error messages are sent at priority
<strong>error</strong>.</p>
<p>"Active" jobs (i.e. jobs that Anacron already decided to run and now
wait for their delay to pass, and jobs that are currently being executed
by Anacron), are "locked", so that other copies of Anacron won't run
them at the same time.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-f</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Force execution of the jobs, ignoring the timestamps.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-u</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Only update the timestamps of the jobs, to the current date, but
don't run anything.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-s</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Serialize execution of jobs. Anacron will not start a new job before
the previous one finished.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-n</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run jobs now. Ignore the delay specifications in the
<em>/etc/anacrontab</em> file. This options implies
<strong>-s</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Don't fork to the background. In this mode, Anacron will output
informational messages to standard error, as well as to syslog. The
output of jobs is mailed as usual.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-q</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Suppress messages to standard error. Only applicable with
<strong>-d</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-t anacrontab</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use specified anacrontab, rather than the default</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-T</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Anacrontab testing. The configuration file will be tested for
validity. If there is an error in the file, an error will be shown and
anacron will return 1. Valid anacrontabs will return 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-S spooldir</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use the specified spooldir to store timestamps in. This option is
required for users who wish to run anacron themselves.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print version information, and exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-h</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print short usage message, and exit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>SIGNALS</h1>
<p>After receiving a <strong>SIGUSR1</strong> signal, Anacron waits for
running jobs, if any, to finish and then exits. This can be used to stop
Anacron cleanly.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Make sure that the time-zone is set correctly before Anacron is
started. (The time-zone affects the date). This is usually accomplished
by setting the TZ environment variable, or by installing a
<em>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime</em> file. See <strong>tzset(3)</strong>
for more information.</p>
<p>Timestamp files are created in the spool directory for each job in
anacrontab. These are never removed automatically by anacron, and should
be removed by hand if a job is no longer being scheduled.</p>
<h1>DEBIAN-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>On Debian-based systems, anacron will be activated hourly every day
from 07:30 local time to 23:30 local time through cron job (on
non-systemd systems where cron is installed and enabled) or systemd
timer (on systemd-based systems). On activation, anacron will check if
it missed some jobs. If yes, it will start those jobs after a short
period of time.</p>
<p>By default, The hourly activation of anacron will not take place when
the system is using battery and no AC power is connected to the
computer. It is meant to reduce power usage and extend battery life, but
such design might lead to unwanted results. Users may disable this
feature and let anacron run regardless of power supply. Please read
Debian-specific documentation in
<em>/usr/share/doc/anacron/README.Debian</em> file for detailed
instruction in now to change such behaviour.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/anacrontab</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains specifications of jobs. See <strong>anacrontab(5)</strong>
for a complete description.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/var/spool/anacron</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This directory is used by Anacron for storing timestamp files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/lib/systemd/system/anacron.service</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This file provides systemd service for anacron.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/lib/systemd/system/anacron.timer</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This file provides systemd timer for anacron. Currently the service
is triggered hourly through systemd timer.</p>
</dd>

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Anacron never removes timestamp files. Remove unused files
manually.</p>
<p>Anacron uses up to two file descriptors for each active job. It may
run out of descriptors if there are more than about 125 active jobs (on
normal kernels).</p>
