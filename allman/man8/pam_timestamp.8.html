<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pam_timestamp - Authenticate using cached successful authentication
attempts</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pam_timestamp.so</strong> [timestampdir=<em>directory</em>]
[timestamp_timeout=<em>number</em>] [verbose] [debug]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In a nutshell, <em>pam_timestamp</em> caches successful
authentication attempts, and allows you to use a recent successful
attempt as the basis for authentication. This is similar mechanism which
is used in <strong>sudo</strong>.</p>
<p>When an application opens a session using <em>pam_timestamp</em>, a
timestamp file is created in the <em>timestampdir</em> directory for the
user. When an application attempts to authenticate the user, a
<em>pam_timestamp</em> will treat a sufficiently recent timestamp file
as grounds for succeeding.</p>
<p>The default encryption hash is taken from the
<strong>HMAC_CRYPTO_ALGO</strong> variable from
<em>/etc/login.defs</em>.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>timestampdir=</strong><em>directory</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify an alternate directory where <em>pam_timestamp</em> creates
timestamp files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>timestamp_timeout=</strong><em>number</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long should <em>pam_timestamp</em> treat timestamp as valid after
their last modification date (in seconds). Default is 300 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempt to inform the user when access is granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>debug</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns on debugging messages sent to <strong>syslog</strong>(3).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED</h1>
<p>The <strong>auth</strong> and <strong>session</strong> module types
are provided.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1>
<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The module was not able to retrieve the user name or no valid
timestamp file was found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PAM_SUCCESS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything was successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PAM_SESSION_ERR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Timestamp file could not be created or updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Users can get confused when they are not always asked for passwords
when running a given program. Some users reflexively begin typing
information before noticing that it is not being asked for.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>auth sufficient pam_timestamp.so verbose
