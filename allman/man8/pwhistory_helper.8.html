<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pwhistory_helper - Helper binary that transfers password hashes from
passwd or shadow to opasswd</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pwhistory_helper</strong> [...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>pwhistory_helper</em> is a helper program for the
<em>pam_pwhistory</em> module that transfers password hashes from passwd
or shadow file to the opasswd file and checks a password supplied by
user against the existing hashes in the opasswd file.</p>
<p>The purpose of the helper is to enable tighter confinement of login
and password changing services. The helper is thus called only when
SELinux is enabled on the system.</p>
<p>The interface of the helper - command line options, and input/output
data format are internal to the <em>pam_pwhistory</em> module and it
should not be called directly from applications.</p>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p><strong>pam_pwhistory</strong>(8)</p>
<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
<p>Written by Tomas Mraz based on the code originally in
<em>pam_pwhistory and pam_unix</em> modules.</p>
