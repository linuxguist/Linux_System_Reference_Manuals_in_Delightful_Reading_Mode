<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pidof - find the process ID of a running program</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pidof</strong> [<strong>-s</strong>] [<strong>-c</strong>]
[<strong>-n</strong>] [<strong>-x</strong>] [<strong>-z</strong>]
[<strong>-o</strong> <em>omitpid[,omitpid...]</em>] [<strong>-o</strong>
<em>omitpid[,omitpid...]...</em>] [<strong>-d</strong> <em>sep</em>]
<em>program</em> [<em>program...</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>pidof</strong> finds the process id's (PIDs) of the named
programs. It prints those id's on the standard output. This program is
on some systems used in run-level change scripts, especially when the
system has a <em>System-V</em> like <em>rc</em> structure. In that case
these scripts are located in <em>/etc/rc?.d</em>, where ? is the
runlevel. If the system has a <strong>start-stop-daemon</strong>(8)
program that should be used instead.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-s</dt>
<dd>
<p>Single shot - this instructs the program to only return one
<em>pid</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only return process PIDs that are running with the same root
directory. This option is ignored for non-root users, as they will be
unable to check the current root directory of processes they do not
own.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-n</dt>
<dd>
<p>Avoid <strong>stat</strong>(2) system function call on all binaries
which are located on network based file systems like
<strong>NFS</strong>. Instead of using this option the variable
<strong>PIDOF_NETFS</strong> may be set and exported.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-q</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not display matched PIDs to standard out. Simply exit with a
status of true or false to indicate whether a matching PID was
found.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-x</dt>
<dd>
<p>Scripts too - this causes the program to also return process id's of
shells running the named scripts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-z</dt>
<dd>
<p>Try to detect processes which are stuck in zombie (Z) status. Usually
these processes are skipped as trying to deal with them can cause pidof
or related tools to hang. Note: In the past pidof would ignore processes
in the uninterruptable state (D), unless the <strong>-z</strong> flag
was specified. This is no longer the case. The <strong>pidof</strong>
program will find and report processes in the D state whether
<strong>-z</strong> is specified or not.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-d sep</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tells <em>pidof</em> to use <em>sep</em> as an output separator if
more than one PID is shown. The default separator is a space.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-o omitpid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tells <em>pidof</em> to omit processes with that process id. The
special pid <strong>%PPID</strong> can be used to name the parent
process of the <strong>pidof</strong> program, in other words the
calling shell or shell script.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>0</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>At least one program was found with the requested name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>1</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>No program was found with the requested name.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p><em>pidof</em> is actually the same program as
<strong>killall5</strong>(8); the program behaves according to the name
under which it is called.</p>
<p>When <strong>pidof</strong> is invoked with a full pathname to the
program it should find the pid of, it is reasonably safe. Otherwise it
is possible that it returns PIDs of running programs that happen to have
the same name as the program you're after but are actually other
programs. Note that the executable name of running processes is
calculated with <strong>readlink</strong>(2), so symbolic links to
executables will also match.</p>
<p>Zombie processes or processes in disk sleep (states Z and D,
respectively) are ignored, as attempts to access the stats of these will
sometimes fail. The <strong>-z</strong> flag (see above) tells
<strong>pidof</strong> to try to detect these sleeping and zombie
processes, at the risk of failing or hanging.</p>
