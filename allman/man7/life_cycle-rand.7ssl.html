<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>life_cycle-rand - The RAND algorithm life-cycle</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>All random number generator (RANDs) go through a number of stages in
their life-cycle:</p>
<dl>
<dt>start</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state represents the RAND before it has been allocated. It is
the starting state for any life-cycle transitions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>newed</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state represents the RAND after it has been allocated but unable
to generate any output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>instantiated</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state represents the RAND when it is set up and capable of
generating output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>uninstantiated</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state represents the RAND when it has been shutdown and it is no
longer capable of generating output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>freed</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state is entered when the RAND is freed. It is the terminal
state for all life-cycle transitions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>State Transition Diagram</h2>
<p>The usual life-cycle of a RAND is illustrated:
+-------------------------+ | start | +-------------------------+ | |
EVP_RAND_CTX_new v +-------------------------+ | newed |
+-------------------------+ | | EVP_RAND_instantiate v EVP_RAND_generate
+-------------------------+ +-------------------- | | | | instantiated |
+-------------------&gt; | | &lt;+ +-------------------------+ ' | ' |
EVP_RAND_uninstantiate ' EVP_RAND_instantiate v '
+-------------------------+ ' | uninstantiated | -+
+-------------------------+ | | EVP_RAND_CTX_free v
+-------------------------+ | freed | +-------------------------+</p>
<h2>Formal State Transitions</h2>
<p>This section defines all of the legal state transitions. This is the
canonical list. Function Call ------------------ Current State
------------------ start newed instantiated uninstantiated freed
EVP_RAND_CTX_new newed EVP_RAND_instantiate instantiated
EVP_RAND_generate instantiated EVP_RAND_uninstantiate uninstantiated
EVP_RAND_CTX_free freed freed freed freed EVP_RAND_CTX_get_params newed
instantiated uninstantiated freed EVP_RAND_CTX_set_params newed
instantiated uninstantiated freed EVP_RAND_CTX_gettable_params newed
instantiated uninstantiated freed EVP_RAND_CTX_settable_params newed
instantiated uninstantiated freed</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>At some point the EVP layer will begin enforcing the transitions
described herein.</p>
