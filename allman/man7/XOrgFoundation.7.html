<p>XOrgFoundation - X.Org Foundation information</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Release 6.7 and later of X Version 11 is brought to you by the X.Org
Foundation.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The X.Org Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit 501(c)(3)
charity corporation. It was formed in 2004 as the successor to the X.Org
Group at The Open Group. The purpose of the X.Org Foundation is to
foster the development, evolution, and maintenance of the X Window
System, a comprehensive set of vendor-neutral, system-architecture
neutral, network-transparent windowing and user interface standards.
Membership in the X.Org Foundation is free and open to anyone. The X.Org
Foundation hosts a public git repository of the source code on
freedesktop.org.</p>
<p>The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
support further development of the X Window System. In 1992, MIT and the
membership decided it was in their best interests to move the consortium
out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization. All
rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc.
on January 1, 1994. On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc. closed
its doors and all rights to the X Window System were assigned to The
Open Group (then known as the Open Software Foundation).</p>
