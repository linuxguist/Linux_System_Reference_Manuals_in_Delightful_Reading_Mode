<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>life_cycle-kdf - The KDF algorithm life-cycle</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>All key derivation functions (KDFs) and pseudo random functions
(PRFs) go through a number of stages in their life-cycle:</p>
<dl>
<dt>start</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state represents the KDF/PRF before it has been allocated. It is
the starting state for any life-cycle transitions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>newed</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state represents the KDF/PRF after it has been allocated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>deriving</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state represents the KDF/PRF when it is set up and capable of
generating output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>freed</dt>
<dd>
<p>This state is entered when the KDF/PRF is freed. It is the terminal
state for all life-cycle transitions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>State Transition Diagram</h2>
<p>The usual life-cycle of a KDF/PRF is illustrated:
+-------------------+ | start | +-------------------+ | |
EVP_KDF_CTX_new v +-------------------+ | newed | &lt;+
+-------------------+ | | | | EVP_KDF_derive | v | EVP_KDF_CTX_reset
EVP_KDF_derive +-------------------+ | + - - - - - - - - | | | ' |
deriving | | + - - - - - - - -&gt; | | -+ +-------------------+ | |
EVP_KDF_CTX_free v +-------------------+ | freed |
+-------------------+</p>
<h2>Formal State Transitions</h2>
<p>This section defines all of the legal state transitions. This is the
canonical list. Function Call ------------- Current State -------------
start newed deriving freed EVP_KDF_CTX_new newed EVP_KDF_derive deriving
deriving EVP_KDF_CTX_free freed freed freed EVP_KDF_CTX_reset newed
newed EVP_KDF_CTX_get_params newed deriving EVP_KDF_CTX_set_params newed
deriving EVP_KDF_CTX_gettable_params newed deriving
EVP_KDF_CTX_settable_params newed deriving</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>At some point the EVP layer will begin enforcing the transitions
described herein.</p>
