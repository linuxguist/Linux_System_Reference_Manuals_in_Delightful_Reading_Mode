<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>crypto - OpenSSL cryptographic library</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>See the individual manual pages for details.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The OpenSSL crypto library (<code>libcrypto</code>) implements a wide
range of cryptographic algorithms used in various Internet standards.
The services provided by this library are used by the OpenSSL
implementations of TLS and CMS, and they have also been used to
implement many other third party products and protocols.</p>
<p>The functionality includes symmetric encryption, public key
cryptography, key agreement, certificate handling, cryptographic hash
functions, cryptographic pseudo-random number generators, message
authentication codes (MACs), key derivation functions (KDFs), and
various utilities.</p>
<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p>Cryptographic primitives such as the SHA256 digest, or AES encryption
are referred to in OpenSSL as algorithms. Each algorithm may have
multiple implementations available for use. For example the RSA
algorithm is available as a default implementation suitable for general
use, and a fips implementation which has been validated to FIPS
standards for situations where that is important. It is also possible
that a third party could add additional implementations such as in a
hardware security module (HSM).</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>Different algorithms can be grouped together by their purpose. For
example there are algorithms for encryption, and different algorithms
for digesting data. These different groups are known as operations in
OpenSSL. Each operation has a different set of functions associated with
it. For example to perform an encryption operation using AES (or any
other encryption algorithm) you would use the encryption functions
detailed on the <strong>EVP_EncryptInit</strong> (3) page. Or to perform
a digest operation using SHA256 then you would use the digesting
functions on the <strong>EVP_DigestInit</strong> (3) page.</p>
<h2>Providers</h2>
<p>A provider in OpenSSL is a component that collects together algorithm
implementations. In order to use an algorithm you must have at least one
provider loaded that contains an implementation of it. OpenSSL comes
with a number of providers and they may also be obtained from third
parties. If you don't load a provider explicitly (either in program code
or via config) then the OpenSSL built-in default provider will be
automatically loaded.</p>
<h2>Library contexts</h2>
<p>A library context can be thought of as a scope within which
configuration options take effect. When a provider is loaded, it is only
loaded within the scope of a given library context. In this way it is
possible for different components of a complex application to each use a
different library context and have different providers loaded with
different configuration settings.</p>
<p>If an application does not explicitly create a library context then
the default library context will be used.</p>
<p>Library contexts are represented by the <strong>OSSL_LIB_CTX</strong>
type. Many OpenSSL API functions take a library context as a parameter.
Applications can always pass <strong>NULL</strong> for this parameter to
just use the default library context.</p>
<p>The default library context is automatically created the first time
it is needed. This will automatically load any available configuration
file and will initialise OpenSSL for use. Unlike in earlier versions of
OpenSSL (prior to 1.1.0) no explicit initialisation steps need to be
taken.</p>
<p>Similarly when the application exits the default library context is
automatically destroyed. No explicit de-initialisation steps need to be
taken.</p>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_LIB_CTX</strong> (3) for more information about
library contexts. See also ALGORITHM FETCHING.</p>
<h2>Multi-threaded applications</h2>
<p>As long as OpenSSL has been built with support for threads (the
default case on most platforms) then most OpenSSL <em>functions</em> are
thread-safe in the sense that it is safe to call the same function from
multiple threads at the same time. However most OpenSSL <em>data
structures</em> are not thread-safe. For example the
<strong>BIO_write</strong> (3) and <strong>BIO_read</strong> (3)
functions are thread safe. However it would not be thread safe to call
<strong>BIO_write()</strong> from one thread while calling
<strong>BIO_read()</strong> in another where both functions are passed
the same <strong>BIO</strong> object since both of them may attempt to
make changes to the same <strong>BIO</strong> object.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to these rules. A small number of functions are
not thread safe at all. Where this is the case this restriction should
be noted in the documentation for the function. Similarly some data
structures may be partially or fully thread safe. For example it is safe
to use an <strong>OSSL_LIB_CTX</strong> in multiple threads.</p>
<p>See <strong>openssl-threads</strong> (7) for a more detailed
discussion on OpenSSL threading support.</p>
<h1>ALGORITHM FETCHING</h1>
<p>In order to use an algorithm an implementation for it must first be
fetched. Fetching is the process of looking through the available
implementations, applying selection criteria (via a property query
string), and finally choosing the implementation that will be used.</p>
<p>Two types of fetching are supported by OpenSSL - explicit fetching
and implicit fetching.</p>
<h2>Property query strings</h2>
<p>When fetching an algorithm it is possible to specify a property query
string to guide the selection process. For example a property query
string of provider=default could be used to force the selection to only
consider algorithm implementations in the default provider.</p>
<p>Property query strings can be specified explicitly as an argument to
a function. It is also possible to specify a default property query
string for the whole library context using the
<strong>EVP_set_default_properties</strong> (3) or
<strong>EVP_default_properties_enable_fips</strong> (3) functions. Where
both default properties and function specific properties are specified
then they are combined. Function specific properties will override
default properties where there is a conflict.</p>
<p>See <strong>property</strong> (7) for more information about
properties.</p>
<h2>Explicit fetching</h2>
<p>Users of the OpenSSL libraries never query a provider directly for an
algorithm implementation. Instead, the diverse OpenSSL APIs often have
explicit fetching functions that do the work, and they return an
appropriate algorithm object back to the user. These functions usually
have the name <code>APINAME_fetch</code>, where <code>APINAME</code> is
the name of the operation. For example <strong>EVP_MD_fetch</strong> (3)
can be used to explicitly fetch a digest algorithm implementation. The
user is responsible for freeing the object returned from the
<code>APINAME_fetch</code> function using <code>APINAME_free</code> when
it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>These fetching functions follow a fairly common pattern, where three
arguments are passed:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The library context</dt>
<dd>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_LIB_CTX</strong> (3) for a more detailed
description. This may be NULL to signify the default (global) library
context, or a context created by the user. Only providers loaded in this
library context (see <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER_load</strong> (3)) will be
considered by the fetching function. In case no provider has been loaded
in this library context then the default provider will be loaded as a
fallback (see <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-default</strong> (7)).</p>
</dd>
<dt>An identifier</dt>
<dd>
<p>For all currently implemented fetching functions this is the
algorithm name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A property query string</dt>
<dd>
<p>The property query string used to guide selection of the algorithm
implementation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The algorithm implementation that is fetched can then be used with
other diverse functions that use them. For example the
<strong>EVP_DigestInit_ex</strong> (3) function takes as a parameter an
<strong>EVP_MD</strong> object which may have been returned from an
earlier call to <strong>EVP_MD_fetch</strong> (3).</p>
<h2>Implicit fetching</h2>
<p>OpenSSL has a number of functions that return an algorithm object
with no associated implementation, such as
<strong>EVP_sha256</strong> (3), <strong>EVP_aes_128_cbc</strong> (3),
<strong>EVP_get_cipherbyname</strong> (3) or
<strong>EVP_get_digestbyname</strong> (3). These are present for
compatibility with OpenSSL before version 3.0 where explicit fetching
was not available.</p>
<p>When they are used with functions like
<strong>EVP_DigestInit_ex</strong> (3) or
<strong>EVP_CipherInit_ex</strong> (3), the actual implementation to be
used is fetched implicitly using default search criteria.</p>
<p>In some cases implicit fetching can also occur when a NULL algorithm
parameter is supplied. In this case an algorithm implementation is
implicitly fetched using default search criteria and an algorithm name
that is consistent with the context in which it is being used.</p>
<p>Functions that revolve around <strong>EVP_PKEY_CTX</strong> and
<strong>EVP_PKEY</strong> (3), such as
<strong>EVP_DigestSignInit</strong> (3) and friends, all fetch the
implementations implicitly. Because these functions involve both an
operation type (such as <strong>EVP_SIGNATURE</strong> (3)) and an
<strong>EVP_KEYMGMT</strong> (3) for the <strong>EVP_PKEY</strong> (3),
they try the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Fetch the operation type implementation from any provider given a
library context and property string stored in the
<strong>EVP_PKEY_CTX</strong>. If the provider of the operation type
implementation is different from the provider of the
<strong>EVP_PKEY</strong> (3)'s <strong>EVP_KEYMGMT</strong> (3)
implementation, try to fetch a <strong>EVP_KEYMGMT</strong> (3)
implementation in the same provider as the operation type implementation
and export the <strong>EVP_PKEY</strong> (3) to it (effectively making a
temporary copy of the original key). If anything in this step fails, the
next step is used as a fallback.</p></li>
<li><p>As a fallback, try to fetch the operation type implementation
from the same provider as the original <strong>EVP_PKEY</strong> (3)'s
<strong>EVP_KEYMGMT</strong> (3), still using the property string from
the <strong>EVP_PKEY_CTX</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>If you perform the same operation many times then it is recommended
to use Explicit fetching to prefetch an algorithm once initially, and
then pass this created object to any operations that are currently using
Implicit fetching. See an example of Explicit fetching in USING
ALGORITHMS IN APPLICATIONS.</p>
<p>Prior to OpenSSL 3.0, constant method tables (such as
<strong>EVP_sha256()</strong>) were used directly to access methods. If
you pass one of these convenience functions to an operation the fixed
methods are ignored, and only the name is used to internally fetch
methods from a provider.</p>
<p>If the prefetched object is not passed to operations, then any
implicit fetch will use the internally cached prefetched object, but it
will still be slower than passing the prefetched object directly.</p>
<p>Fetching via a provider offers more flexibility, but it is slower
than the old method, since it must search for the algorithm in all
loaded providers, and then populate the method table using provider
supplied methods. Internally OpenSSL caches similar algorithms on the
first fetch (so loading a digest caches all digests).</p>

<h1>FETCHING EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The following section provides a series of examples of fetching
algorithm implementations.</p>
<p>Fetch any available implementation of SHA2-256 in the default
context. Note that some algorithms have aliases. So SHA256 and SHA2-256
are synonymous:</p>
<p>EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", NULL); ...
EVP_MD_free(md);</p>
<p>Fetch any available implementation of AES-128-CBC in the default
context:</p>
<p>EVP_CIPHER *cipher = EVP_CIPHER_fetch(NULL, "AES-128-CBC", NULL); ...
EVP_CIPHER_free(cipher);</p>
<p>Fetch an implementation of SHA2-256 from the default provider in the
default context:</p>
<p>EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", "provider=default"); ...
EVP_MD_free(md);</p>
<p>Fetch an implementation of SHA2-256 that is not from the default
provider in the default context:</p>
<p>EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", "provider!=default"); ...
EVP_MD_free(md);</p>
<p>Fetch an implementation of SHA2-256 from the default provider in the
specified context:</p>
<p>EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(ctx, "SHA2-256", "provider=default"); ...
EVP_MD_free(md);</p>
<p>Load the legacy provider into the default context and then fetch an
implementation of WHIRLPOOL from it:</p>
<p>/* This only needs to be done once - usually at application start up
*/ OSSL_PROVIDER *legacy = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "legacy"); EVP_MD
*md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "WHIRLPOOL", "provider=legacy"); ...
EVP_MD_free(md);</p>
<p>Note that in the above example the property string provider=legacy is
optional since, assuming no other providers have been loaded, the only
implementation of the whirlpool algorithm is in the legacy provider.
Also note that the default provider should be explicitly loaded if it is
required in addition to other providers:</p>
<p>/* This only needs to be done once - usually at application start up
*/ OSSL_PROVIDER *legacy = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "legacy");
OSSL_PROVIDER *default = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "default"); EVP_MD
*md_whirlpool = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "whirlpool", NULL); EVP_MD *md_sha256
= EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", NULL); ... EVP_MD_free(md_whirlpool);
EVP_MD_free(md_sha256);</p>
<h1>OPENSSL PROVIDERS</h1>
<p>OpenSSL comes with a set of providers.</p>
<p>The algorithms available in each of these providers may vary due to
build time configuration options. The <strong>openssl-list</strong> (1)
command can be used to list the currently available algorithms.</p>
<p>The names of the algorithms shown from
<strong>openssl-list</strong> (1) can be used as an algorithm identifier
to the appropriate fetching function. Also see the provider specific
manual pages linked below for further details about using the algorithms
available in each of the providers.</p>
<p>As well as the OpenSSL providers third parties can also implement
providers. For information on writing a provider see
<strong>provider</strong> (7).</p>
<h2>Default provider</h2>
<p>The default provider is built in as part of the <em>libcrypto</em>
library and contains all of the most commonly used algorithm
implementations. Should it be needed (if other providers are loaded and
offer implementations of the same algorithms), the property query string
provider=default can be used as a search criterion for these
implementations. The default provider includes all of the functionality
in the base provider below.</p>
<p>If you don't load any providers at all then the default provider will
be automatically loaded. If you explicitly load any provider then the
default provider would also need to be explicitly loaded if it is
required.</p>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-default</strong> (7).</p>
<h2>Base provider</h2>
<p>The base provider is built in as part of the <em>libcrypto</em>
library and contains algorithm implementations for encoding and decoding
for OpenSSL keys. Should it be needed (if other providers are loaded and
offer implementations of the same algorithms), the property query string
provider=base can be used as a search criterion for these
implementations. Some encoding and decoding algorithm implementations
are not FIPS algorithm implementations in themselves but support
algorithms from the FIPS provider and are allowed for use in FIPS mode.
The property query string fips=yes can be used to select such
algorithms.</p>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-base</strong> (7).</p>
<h2>FIPS provider</h2>
<p>The FIPS provider is a dynamically loadable module, and must
therefore be loaded explicitly, either in code or through OpenSSL
configuration (see <strong>config</strong> (5)). It contains algorithm
implementations that have been validated according to the FIPS 140-2
standard. Should it be needed (if other providers are loaded and offer
implementations of the same algorithms), the property query string
provider=fips can be used as a search criterion for these
implementations. All approved algorithm implementations in the FIPS
provider can also be selected with the property fips=yes. The FIPS
provider may also contain non-approved algorithm implementations and
these can be selected with the property fips=no.</p>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS</strong> (7) and
<strong>fips_module</strong> (7).</p>
<h2>Legacy provider</h2>
<p>The legacy provider is a dynamically loadable module, and must
therefore be loaded explicitly, either in code or through OpenSSL
configuration (see <strong>config</strong> (5)). It contains algorithm
implementations that are considered insecure, or are no longer in common
use such as MD2 or RC4. Should it be needed (if other providers are
loaded and offer implementations of the same algorithms), the property
provider=legacy can be used as a search criterion for these
implementations.</p>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy</strong> (7).</p>
<h2>Null provider</h2>
<p>The null provider is built in as part of the <em>libcrypto</em>
library. It contains no algorithms in it at all. When fetching
algorithms the default provider will be automatically loaded if no other
provider has been explicitly loaded. To prevent that from happening you
can explicitly load the null provider.</p>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-null</strong> (7).</p>
<h1>USING ALGORITHMS IN APPLICATIONS</h1>
<p>Cryptographic algorithms are made available to applications through
use of the EVP APIs. Each of the various operations such as encryption,
digesting, message authentication codes, etc., have a set of EVP
function calls that can be invoked to use them. See the
<strong>evp</strong> (7) page for further details.</p>
<p>Most of these follow a common pattern. A context object is first
created. For example for a digest operation you would use an
<strong>EVP_MD_CTX</strong>, and for an encryption/decryption operation
you would use an <strong>EVP_CIPHER_CTX</strong>. The operation is then
initialised ready for use via an init function - optionally passing in a
set of parameters (using the <strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) type) to
configure how the operation should behave. Next data is fed into the
operation in a series of update calls. The operation is finalised using
a final call which will typically provide some kind of output. Finally
the context is cleaned up and freed.</p>
<p>The following shows a complete example for doing this process for
digesting data using SHA256. The process is similar for other operations
such as encryption/decryption, signatures, message authentication codes,
etc.</p>
<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt; #include
&lt;openssl/bio.h&gt; #include &lt;openssl/err.h&gt; int main(void) {
EVP_MD_CTX *ctx = NULL; EVP_MD *sha256 = NULL; const unsigned char msg[]
= { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 }; unsigned int len = 0; unsigned char
*outdigest = NULL; int ret = 1; /* Create a context for the digest
operation */ ctx = EVP_MD_CTX_new(); if (ctx == NULL) goto err; /* *
Fetch the SHA256 algorithm implementation for doing the digest. Were *
using the "default" library context here (first NULL parameter), and *
were not supplying any particular search criteria for our SHA256 *
implementation (second NULL parameter). Any SHA256 implementation will *
do. * In a larger application this fetch would just be done once, and
could * be used for multiple calls to other operations such as
EVP_DigestInit_ex(). */ sha256 = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA256", NULL); if
(sha256 == NULL) goto err; /* Initialise the digest operation */ if
(!EVP_DigestInit_ex(ctx, sha256, NULL)) goto err; /* * Pass the message
to be digested. This can be passed in over multiple * EVP_DigestUpdate
calls if necessary */ if (!EVP_DigestUpdate(ctx, msg, sizeof(msg))) goto
err; /* Allocate the output buffer */ outdigest =
OPENSSL_malloc(EVP_MD_get_size(sha256)); if (outdigest == NULL) goto
err; /* Now calculate the digest itself */ if (!EVP_DigestFinal_ex(ctx,
outdigest, &amp;len)) goto err; /* Print out the digest result */
BIO_dump_fp(stdout, outdigest, len); ret = 0; err: /* Clean up all the
resources we allocated */ OPENSSL_free(outdigest); EVP_MD_free(sha256);
EVP_MD_CTX_free(ctx); if (ret != 0) ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr); return
ret; }</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>By default OpenSSL will load a configuration file when it is first
used. This will set up various configuration settings within the default
library context. Applications that create their own library contexts may
optionally configure them with a config file using the
<strong>OSSL_LIB_CTX_load_config</strong> (3) function.</p>
<p>The configuration file can be used to automatically load providers
and set up default property query strings.</p>
<p>For information on the OpenSSL configuration file format see
<strong>config</strong> (5).</p>
<h1>ENCODING AND DECODING KEYS</h1>
<p>Many algorithms require the use of a key. Keys can be generated
dynamically using the EVP APIs (for example see
<strong>EVP_PKEY_Q_keygen</strong> (3)). However it is often necessary
to save or load keys (or their associated parameters) to or from some
external format such as PEM or DER (see
<strong>openssl-glossary</strong> (7)). OpenSSL uses encoders and
decoders to perform this task.</p>
<p>Encoders and decoders are just algorithm implementations in the same
way as any other algorithm implementation in OpenSSL. They are
implemented by providers. The OpenSSL encoders and decoders are
available in the default provider. They are also duplicated in the base
provider.</p>
<p>For information about encoders see
<strong>OSSL_ENCODER_CTX_new_for_pkey</strong> (3). For information
about decoders see
<strong>OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new_for_pkey</strong> (3).</p>
<h1>LIBRARY CONVENTIONS</h1>
<p>Many OpenSSL functions that get or set a value follow a naming
convention using the numbers <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong>,
i.e. get0, get1, set0 and set1. This can also apply to some functions
that add a value to an existing set, i.e. add0 and add1.</p>
<p>For example the functions:</p>
<p>int X509_CRL_add0_revoked(X509_CRL *crl, X509_REVOKED *rev); int
X509_add1_trust_object(X509 *x, const ASN1_OBJECT *obj);</p>
<p>In the <strong>0</strong> version the ownership of the object is
passed to (for an add or set) or retained by (for a get) the parent
object. For example after calling the
<strong>X509_CRL_add0_revoked()</strong> function above, ownership of
the <em>rev</em> object is passed to the <em>crl</em> object. Therefore,
after calling this function <em>rev</em> should not be freed directly.
It will be freed implicitly when <em>crl</em> is freed.</p>
<p>In the <strong>1</strong> version the ownership of the object is not
passed to or retained by the parent object. Instead a copy or up ref of
the object is performed. So after calling the
<strong>X509_add1_trust_object()</strong> function above the application
will still be responsible for freeing the <em>obj</em> value where
appropriate.</p>
