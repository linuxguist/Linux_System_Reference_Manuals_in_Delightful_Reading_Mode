<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>X - a portable, network-transparent window system</p>
<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>The X Window System is a network transparent window system which runs
on a wide range of computing and graphics machines. It should be
relatively straightforward to build the X.Org Foundation software
distribution on most ANSI C and POSIX compliant systems. Commercial
implementations are also available for a wide range of platforms.</p>
<p>The X.Org Foundation requests that the following names be used when
referring to this software:</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>

<p><em>X Window System</em> is a trademark of The Open Group.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>X Window System servers run on computers with bitmap displays. The
server distributes user input to and accepts output requests from
various client programs through a variety of different interprocess
communication channels. Although the most common case is for the client
programs to be running on the same machine as the server, clients can be
run transparently from other machines (including machines with different
architectures and operating systems) as well.</p>
<p>X supports overlapping hierarchical subwindows and text and graphics
operations, on both monochrome and color displays. For a full
explanation of the functions that are available, see the <em>Xlib - C
Language X Interface</em> manual, the <em>X Window System Protocol</em>
specification, the <em>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface</em>
manual, and various toolkit documents.</p>

<p>Many other utilities, window managers, games, toolkits, etc. are
included as user-contributed software in the X.Org Foundation
distribution, or are available on the Internet. See your site
administrator for details.</p>
<h1>STARTING UP</h1>
<p>There are two main ways of getting the X server and an initial set of
client applications started. The particular method used depends on what
operating system you are running and whether or not you use other window
systems in addition to X.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Display Manager</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If you want to always have X running on your display, your site
administrator can set your machine up to use a Display Manager such as
<em>xdm</em>, <em>gdm</em>, or <em>kdm</em>. This program is typically
started by the system at boot time and takes care of keeping the server
running and getting users logged in. If you are running one of these
display managers, you will normally see a window on the screen welcoming
you to the system and asking for your login information. Simply type
them in as you would at a normal terminal. If you make a mistake, the
display manager will display an error message and ask you to try again.
After you have successfully logged in, the display manager will start up
your X environment. The documentation for the display manager you use
can provide more details.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><em>xinit</em> (run manually from the shell)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sites that support more than one window system might choose to use
the <em>xinit</em> program for starting X manually. If this is true for
your machine, your site administrator will probably have provided a
program named "x11", "startx", or "xstart" that will do site-specific
initialization (such as loading convenient default resources, running a
window manager, displaying a clock, and starting several terminal
emulators) in a nice way. If not, you can build such a script using the
<em>xinit</em> program. This utility simply runs one user-specified
program to start the server, runs another to start up any desired
clients, and then waits for either to finish. Since either or both of
the user-specified programs may be a shell script, this gives
substantial flexibility at the expense of a nice interface. For this
reason, <em>xinit</em> is not intended for end users.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DISPLAY NAMES</h1>
<p>From the user's perspective, every X server has a <em>display
name</em> of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>hostname:displaynumber.screennumber</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This information is used by the application to determine how it
should connect to the server and which screen it should use by default
(on displays with multiple monitors):</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>hostname</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>hostname</em> specifies the name of the machine to which the
display is physically connected. If the hostname is not given, the most
efficient way of communicating to a server on the same machine will be
used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>displaynumber</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The phrase "display" is usually used to refer to a collection of
monitors that share a common set of input devices (keyboard, mouse,
tablet, etc.). Most workstations tend to only have one display. Larger,
multi-user systems, however, frequently have several displays so that
more than one person can be doing graphics work at once. To avoid
confusion, each display on a machine is assigned a <em>display
number</em> (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display is
started. The display number must always be given in a display name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>screennumber</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some displays share their input devices among two or more monitors.
These may be configured as a single logical screen, which allows windows
to move across screens, or as individual screens, each with their own
set of windows. If configured such that each monitor has its own set of
windows, each screen is assigned a <em>screen number</em> (beginning at
0) when the X server for that display is started. If the screen number
is not given, screen 0 will be used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>On POSIX systems, the default display name is stored in your DISPLAY
environment variable. This variable is set automatically by the
<em>xterm</em> terminal emulator. However, when you log into another
machine on a network, you may need to set DISPLAY by hand to point to
your display. For example,</p>
<pre><code>    % setenv DISPLAY myws:0
    $ DISPLAY=myws:0; export DISPLAY</code></pre>
<p>The <em>ssh</em> program can be used to start an X program on a
remote machine; it automatically sets the DISPLAY variable
correctly.</p>
<p>Finally, most X programs accept a command line option of
<strong>-display</strong> <em>displayname</em> to temporarily override
the contents of DISPLAY. This is most commonly used to pop windows on
another person's screen or as part of a "remote shell" command to start
an xterm pointing back to your display. For example,</p>
<pre><code>    % xeyes -display joesws:0 -geometry 1000x1000+0+0
    % rsh big xterm -display myws:0 -ls &lt;/dev/null &amp;</code></pre>
<p>X servers listen for connections on a variety of different
communications channels (network byte streams, shared memory, etc.).
Since there can be more than one way of contacting a given server, The
<em>hostname</em> part of the display name is used to determine the type
of channel (also called a transport layer) to be used. X servers
generally support the following types of connections:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>local</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
The hostname part of the display name should be the empty string. For
example: <em>:0</em>, <em>:1</em>, and <em>:0.1</em>. The most efficient
local transport will be chosen.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>TCPIP</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
The hostname part of the display name should be the server machine's
hostname or IP address. Full Internet names, abbreviated names, IPv4
addresses, and IPv6 addresses are all allowed. For example:
<em>x.org:0</em>, <em>expo:0</em>, <em>[::1]:0</em>,
<em>198.112.45.11:0</em>, <em>bigmachine:1</em>, and
<em>hydra:0.1</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ACCESS CONTROL</h1>
<p>An X server can use several types of access control. Mechanisms
provided in Release 7 are:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Host Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Simple host-based access control.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Shared plain-text "cookies".</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Secure DES based private-keys.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">SUN-DES-1</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Based on Sun's secure rpc system.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Server Interpreted</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Server-dependent methods of access
control</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Xdm</em> initializes access control for the server and also
places authorization information in a file accessible to the user.</p>
<p>Normally, the list of hosts from which connections are always
accepted should be empty, so that only clients with are explicitly
authorized can connect to the display. When you add entries to the host
list (with <em>xhost</em>), the server no longer performs any
authorization on connections from those machines. Be careful with
this.</p>
<p>The file from which <em>Xlib</em> extracts authorization data can be
specified with the environment variable <strong>XAUTHORITY</strong>, and
defaults to the file <strong>.Xauthority</strong> in the home directory.
<em>Xdm</em> uses <strong>$HOME/.Xauthority</strong> and will create it
or merge in authorization records if it already exists when a user logs
in.</p>
<p>If you use several machines and share a common home directory across
all of the machines by means of a network file system, you never really
have to worry about authorization files, the system should work
correctly by default. Otherwise, as the authorization files are
machine-independent, you can simply copy the files to share them. To
manage authorization files, use <em>xauth</em>. This program allows you
to extract records and insert them into other files. Using this, you can
send authorization to remote machines when you login, if the remote
machine does not share a common home directory with your local machine.
Note that authorization information transmitted ``in the clear'' through
a network file system or using <em>ftp</em> or <em>rcp</em> can be
``stolen'' by a network eavesdropper, and as such may enable
unauthorized access. In many environments, this level of security is not
a concern, but if it is, you need to know the exact semantics of the
particular authorization data to know if this is actually a problem.</p>
<p>For more information on access control, see the <em>Xsecurity</em>(7)
manual page.</p>
<h1>GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS</h1>
<p>One of the advantages of using window systems instead of hardwired
terminals is that applications don't have to be restricted to a
particular size or location on the screen. Although the layout of
windows on a display is controlled by the window manager that the user
is running (described below), most X programs accept a command line
argument of the form <strong>-geometry</strong>
<em>WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF</em> (where <em>WIDTH</em>, <em>HEIGHT</em>,
<em>XOFF</em>, and <em>YOFF</em> are numbers) for specifying a preferred
size and location for this application's main window.</p>
<p>The <em>WIDTH</em> and <em>HEIGHT</em> parts of the geometry
specification are usually measured in either pixels or characters,
depending on the application. The <em>XOFF</em> and <em>YOFF</em> parts
are measured in pixels and are used to specify the distance of the
window from the left or right and top and bottom edges of the screen,
respectively. Both types of offsets are measured from the indicated edge
of the screen to the corresponding edge of the window. The X offset may
be specified in the following ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>+XOFF</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The left edge of the window is to be placed <em>XOFF</em> pixels in
from the left edge of the screen (i.e., the X coordinate of the window's
origin will be <em>XOFF</em>). <em>XOFF</em> may be negative, in which
case the window's left edge will be off the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>-XOFF</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The right edge of the window is to be placed <em>XOFF</em> pixels in
from the right edge of the screen. <em>XOFF</em> may be negative, in
which case the window's right edge will be off the screen.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Y offset has similar meanings:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>+YOFF</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The top edge of the window is to be <em>YOFF</em> pixels below the
top edge of the screen (i.e., the Y coordinate of the window's origin
will be <em>YOFF</em>). <em>YOFF</em> may be negative, in which case the
window's top edge will be off the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>-YOFF</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The bottom edge of the window is to be <em>YOFF</em> pixels above the
bottom edge of the screen. <em>YOFF</em> may be negative, in which case
the window's bottom edge will be off the screen.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Offsets must be given as pairs; in other words, in order to specify
either <em>XOFF</em> or <em>YOFF</em> both must be present. Windows can
be placed in the four corners of the screen using the following
specifications:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>+0+0</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>upper left hand corner.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>-0+0</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>upper right hand corner.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>-0-0</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>lower right hand corner.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>+0-0</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>lower left hand corner.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the following examples, a terminal emulator is placed in roughly
the center of the screen and a load average monitor, mailbox, and clock
are placed in the upper right hand corner:</p>
<pre><code>    xterm -fn 6x10 -geometry 80x24+30+200 &amp;
    xclock -geometry 48x48-0+0 &amp;
    xload -geometry 48x48-96+0 &amp;
    xbiff -geometry 48x48-48+0 &amp;</code></pre>
<h1>WINDOW MANAGERS</h1>
<p>The layout of windows on the screen is controlled by special programs
called <em>window managers</em>. Although many window managers will
honor geometry specifications as given, others may choose to ignore them
(requiring the user to explicitly draw the window's region on the screen
with the pointer, for example).</p>
<p>Since window managers are regular (albeit complex) client programs, a
variety of different user interfaces can be built. The X.Org Foundation
distribution comes with a window manager named <em>twm</em> which
supports overlapping windows, popup menus, point-and-click or
click-to-type input models, title bars, nice icons (and an icon manager
for those who don't like separate icon windows).</p>
<p>See the user-contributed software in the X.Org Foundation
distribution for other popular window managers.</p>
<h1>FONT NAMES</h1>
<p>Collections of characters for displaying text and symbols in X are
known as <em>fonts</em>. A font typically contains images that share a
common appearance and look nice together (for example, a single size,
boldness, slant, and character set). Similarly, collections of fonts
that are based on a common type face (the variations are usually called
roman, bold, italic, bold italic, oblique, and bold oblique) are called
<em>families</em>.</p>
<p>Fonts come in various sizes. The X server supports <em>scalable</em>
fonts, meaning it is possible to create a font of arbitrary size from a
single source for the font. The server supports scaling from
<em>outline</em> fonts and <em>bitmap</em> fonts. Scaling from outline
fonts usually produces significantly better results than scaling from
bitmap fonts.</p>
<p>An X server can obtain fonts from individual files stored in
directories in the file system, or from one or more font servers, or
from a mixtures of directories and font servers. The list of places the
server looks when trying to find a font is controlled by its <em>font
path</em>. Although most installations will choose to have the server
start up with all of the commonly used font directories in the font
path, the font path can be changed at any time with the <em>xset</em>
program. However, it is important to remember that the directory names
are on the <strong>server</strong>'s machine, not on the
application's.</p>
<p>Bitmap font files are usually created by compiling a textual font
description into binary form, using <em>bdftopcf</em>. Font databases
are created by running the <em>mkfontdir</em> program in the directory
containing the source or compiled versions of the fonts. Whenever fonts
are added to a directory, <em>mkfontdir</em> should be rerun so that the
server can find the new fonts. To make the server reread the font
database, reset the font path with the <em>xset</em> program. For
example, to add a font to a private directory, the following commands
could be used:</p>
<pre><code>    % cp newfont.pcf ~/myfonts
    % mkfontdir ~/myfonts
    % xset fp rehash</code></pre>
<p>The <em>xfontsel</em> and <em>xlsfonts</em> programs can be used to
browse through the fonts available on a server. Font names tend to be
fairly long as they contain all of the information needed to uniquely
identify individual fonts. However, the X server supports wildcarding of
font names, so the full specification</p>
<pre><code>    -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1</code></pre>
<p>might be abbreviated as:</p>
<pre><code>    -*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1</code></pre>
<p>Because the shell also has special meanings for <em>*</em> and
<em>?</em>, wildcarded font names should be quoted:</p>
<pre><code>    % xlsfonts -fn &#39;-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>xlsfonts</em> program can be used to list all of the fonts
that match a given pattern. With no arguments, it lists all available
fonts. This will usually list the same font at many different sizes. To
see just the base scalable font names, try using one of the following
patterns:</p>
<pre><code>    -*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-0-0-*-0-*-*
    -*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-75-75-*-0-*-*
    -*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-100-100-*-0-*-*</code></pre>
<p>To convert one of the resulting names into a font at a specific size,
replace one of the first two zeros with a nonzero value. The field
containing the first zero is for the pixel size; replace it with a
specific height in pixels to name a font at that size. Alternatively,
the field containing the second zero is for the point size; replace it
with a specific size in decipoints (there are 722.7 decipoints to the
inch) to name a font at that size. The last zero is an average width
field, measured in tenths of pixels; some servers will anamorphically
scale if this value is specified.</p>
<h1>FONT SERVER NAMES</h1>
<p>One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that
accepts TCP connections:</p>
<pre><code>    tcp/hostname:port
    tcp/hostname:port/cataloguelist</code></pre>
<p>The <em>hostname</em> specifies the name (or decimal numeric address)
of the machine on which the font server is running. The <em>port</em> is
the decimal TCP port on which the font server is listening for
connections. The <em>cataloguelist</em> specifies a list of catalogue
names, with '+' as a separator.</p>
<p>Examples: <em>tcp/x.org:7100</em>,
<em>tcp/198.112.45.11:7100/all</em>.</p>
<h1>COLOR NAMES</h1>
<p>Most applications provide ways of tailoring (usually through
resources or command line arguments) the colors of various elements in
the text and graphics they display. A color can be specified either by
an abstract color name, or by a numerical color specification. The
numerical specification can identify a color in either device-dependent
(RGB) or device-independent terms. Color strings are
case-insensitive.</p>
<p>X supports the use of abstract color names, for example, "red",
"blue". A value for this abstract name is obtained by searching one or
more color name databases. <em>Xlib</em> first searches zero or more
client-side databases; the number, location, and content of these
databases is implementation dependent. If the name is not found, the
color is looked up in the X server's database. The text form of this
database is commonly stored in the file
<em>usr/share/X11/rgb.txt</em>.</p>
<p>A numerical color specification consists of a color space name and a
set of values in the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;color_space_name&gt;:&lt;value&gt;/.../&lt;value&gt;</code></pre>
<p>An RGB Device specification is identified by the prefix "rgb:" and
has the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>    rgb:&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;

        &lt;red&gt;, &lt;green&gt;, &lt;blue&gt; := h | hh | hhh | hhhh
        h := single hexadecimal digits</code></pre>
<p>Note that <em>h</em> indicates the value scaled in 4 bits,
<em>hh</em> the value scaled in 8 bits, <em>hhh</em> the value scaled in
12 bits, and <em>hhhh</em> the value scaled in 16 bits, respectively.
These values are passed directly to the X server, and are assumed to be
gamma corrected.</p>
<p>The eight primary colors can be represented as:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">black</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:0/0/0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">red</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:ffff/0/0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">green</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:0/ffff/0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">blue</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:0/0/ffff</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">yellow</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:ffff/ffff/0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">magenta</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:ffff/0/ffff</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">cyan</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:0/ffff/ffff</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">white</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">rgb:ffff/ffff/ffff</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For backward compatibility, an older syntax for RGB Device is
supported, but its continued use is not encouraged. The syntax is an
initial sharp sign character followed by a numeric specification, in one
of the following formats:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">#RGB</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(4 bits each)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">#RRGGBB</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(8 bits each)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">#RRRGGGBBB</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(12 bits each)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">#RRRRGGGGBBBB</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(16 bits each)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The R, G, and B represent single hexadecimal digits. When fewer than
16 bits each are specified, they represent the most-significant bits of
the value (unlike the "rgb:" syntax, in which values are scaled). For
example, #3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000.</p>
<p>An RGB intensity specification is identified by the prefix "rgbi:"
and has the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>    rgbi:&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The red, green, and blue are floating point values between 0.0 and
1.0, inclusive. They represent linear intensity values, with 1.0
indicating full intensity, 0.5 half intensity, and so on. These values
will be gamma corrected by <em>Xlib</em> before being sent to the X
server. The input format for these values is an optional sign, a string
of numbers possibly containing a decimal point, and an optional exponent
field containing an E or e followed by a possibly signed integer
string.</p>
<p>The standard device-independent string specifications have the
following syntax:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td
style="text-align: left;">CIEXYZ:<em>&lt;X&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;/&lt;Z&gt;</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(<em>none</em>, 1, <em>none</em>)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td
style="text-align: left;">CIEuvY:<em>&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(~.6, ~.6, 1)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td
style="text-align: left;">CIExyY:<em>&lt;x&gt;/&lt;y&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(~.75, ~.85, 1)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td
style="text-align: left;">CIELab:<em>&lt;L&gt;/&lt;a&gt;/&lt;b&gt;</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(100, <em>none</em>, <em>none</em>)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td
style="text-align: left;">CIELuv:<em>&lt;L&gt;/&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt;</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(100, <em>none</em>, <em>none</em>)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td
style="text-align: left;">TekHVC:<em>&lt;H&gt;/&lt;V&gt;/&lt;C&gt;</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">(360, 100, 100)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All of the values (C, H, V, X, Y, Z, a, b, u, v, y, x) are floating
point values. Some of the values are constrained to be between zero and
some upper bound; the upper bounds are given in parentheses above. The
syntax for these values is an optional '+' or '-' sign, a string of
digits possibly containing a decimal point, and an optional exponent
field consisting of an 'E' or 'e' followed by an optional '+' or '-'
followed by a string of digits.</p>

<h1>KEYBOARDS</h1>
<p>The X keyboard model is broken into two layers: server-specific codes
(called <em>keycodes</em>) which represent the physical keys, and
server-independent symbols (called <em>keysyms</em>) which represent the
letters or words that appear on the keys. Two tables are kept in the
server for converting keycodes to keysyms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>modifier list</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some keys (such as Shift, Control, and Caps Lock) are known as
<em>modifier</em> and are used to select different symbols that are
attached to a single key (such as Shift-a generates a capital A, and
Control-l generates a control character ^L). The server keeps a list of
keycodes corresponding to the various modifier keys. Whenever a key is
pressed or released, the server generates an <em>event</em> that
contains the keycode of the indicated key as well as a mask that
specifies which of the modifier keys are currently pressed. Most servers
set up this list to initially contain the various shift, control, and
shift lock keys on the keyboard.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>keymap table</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Applications translate event keycodes and modifier masks into keysyms
using a <em>keysym table</em> which contains one row for each keycode
and one column for various modifier states. This table is initialized by
the server to correspond to normal typewriter conventions. The exact
semantics of how the table is interpreted to produce keysyms depends on
the particular program, libraries, and language input method used, but
the following conventions for the first four keysyms in each row are
generally adhered to:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first four elements of the list are split into two groups of
keysyms. Group 1 contains the first and second keysyms; Group 2 contains
the third and fourth keysyms. Within each group, if the first element is
alphabetic and the the second element is the special keysym
<em>NoSymbol</em>, then the group is treated as equivalent to a group in
which the first element is the lowercase letter and the second element
is the uppercase letter.</p>
<p>Switching between groups is controlled by the keysym named MODE
SWITCH, by attaching that keysym to some key and attaching that key to
any one of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5. This modifier is called the
``group modifier.'' Group 1 is used when the group modifier is off, and
Group 2 is used when the group modifier is on.</p>
<p>Within a group, the modifier state determines which keysym to use.
The first keysym is used when the Shift and Lock modifiers are off. The
second keysym is used when the Shift modifier is on, when the Lock
modifier is on and the second keysym is uppercase alphabetic, or when
the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as ShiftLock. Otherwise, when
the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as CapsLock, the state of the
Shift modifier is applied first to select a keysym; but if that keysym
is lowercase alphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase keysym is used
instead.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Most X programs attempt to use the same names for command line
options and arguments. All applications written with the X Toolkit
Intrinsics automatically accept the following options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-display <em>display</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the name of the X server to use.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-geometry <em>geometry</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the initial size and location of the
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-bg <em>color</em>, <strong>-background</strong>
<em>color</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Either option specifies the color to use for the window
background.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-bd <em>color</em><strong>,</strong>
<strong>-bordercolor</strong> <em>color</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Either option specifies the color to use for the window border.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-bw <em>number</em><strong>,</strong>
<strong>-borderwidth</strong> <em>number</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Either option specifies the width in pixels of the window border.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-fg <em>color</em><strong>,</strong>
<strong>-foreground</strong> <em>color</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Either option specifies the color to use for text or graphics.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-fn <em>font</em><strong>,</strong> <strong>-font</strong>
<em>font</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Either option specifies the font to use for displaying text.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-iconic</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
This option indicates that the user would prefer that the application's
windows initially not be visible as if the windows had be immediately
iconified by the user. Window managers may choose not to honor the
application's request.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-name</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
This option specifies the name under which resources for the application
should be found. This option is useful in shell aliases to distinguish
between invocations of an application, without resorting to creating
links to alter the executable file name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-rv<em>,</em> <strong>-reverse</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Either option indicates that the program should simulate reverse
video if possible, often by swapping the foreground and background
colors. Not all programs honor this or implement it correctly. It is
usually only used on monochrome displays.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>+rv</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
This option indicates that the program should not simulate reverse
video. This is used to override any defaults since reverse video doesn't
always work properly.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-selectionTimeout</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the timeout in milliseconds within which two
communicating applications must respond to one another for a selection
request.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-synchronous</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option indicates that requests to the X server should be sent
synchronously, instead of asynchronously. Since <em>Xlib</em> normally
buffers requests to the server, errors do not necessarily get reported
immediately after they occur. This option turns off the buffering so
that the application can be debugged. It should never be used with a
working program.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-title <em>string</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the title to be used for this window. This
information is sometimes used by a window manager to provide some sort
of header identifying the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-xnllanguage
<em>language[_territory][.codeset]</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the language, territory, and codeset for use in
resolving resource and other filenames.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-xrm <em>resourcestring</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies a resource name and value to override any
defaults. It is also very useful for setting resources that don't have
explicit command line arguments.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>RESOURCES</h1>
<p>To make the tailoring of applications to personal preferences easier,
X provides a mechanism for storing default values for program resources
(e.g. background color, window title, etc.) that is used by programs
that use toolkits based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics library libXt.
(Programs using the common Gtk+ and Qt toolkits use other configuration
mechanisms.) Resources are specified as strings that are read in from
various places when an application is run. Program components are named
in a hierarchical fashion, with each node in the hierarchy identified by
a class and an instance name. At the top level is the class and instance
name of the application itself. By convention, the class name of the
application is the same as the program name, but with the first letter
capitalized (e.g. <em>Bitmap or Emacs)</em> although some programs that
begin with the letter ``x'' also capitalize the second letter for
historical reasons.</p>
<p>The precise syntax for resources is:</p>
<pre><code>ResourceLine    =       Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | &lt;empty line&gt;
Comment         =       &quot;!&quot; {&lt;any character except null or newline&gt;}
IncludeFile     =       &quot;#&quot; WhiteSpace &quot;include&quot; WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
FileName        =       &lt;valid filename for operating system&gt;
ResourceSpec    =       WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace &quot;:&quot; WhiteSpace Value
ResourceName    =       [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
Binding         =       &quot;.&quot; | &quot;*&quot;
WhiteSpace      =       {&lt;space&gt; | &lt;horizontal tab&gt;}
Component       =       &quot;?&quot; | ComponentName
ComponentName   =       NameChar {NameChar}
NameChar        =       &quot;a&quot;-&quot;z&quot; | &quot;A&quot;-&quot;Z&quot; | &quot;0&quot;-&quot;9&quot; | &quot;_&quot; | &quot;-&quot;
Value           =       {&lt;any character except null or unescaped newline&gt;}</code></pre>
<p>Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives. Curly braces
({...}) indicate zero or more repetitions of the enclosed elements.
Square brackets ([...]) indicate that the enclosed element is optional.
Quotes ("...") are used around literal characters.</p>
<p>IncludeFile lines are interpreted by replacing the line with the
contents of the specified file. The word "include" must be in lowercase.
The filename is interpreted relative to the directory of the file in
which the line occurs (for example, if the filename contains no
directory or contains a relative directory specification).</p>
<p>If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of two or more
Binding characters, the sequence will be replaced with single "."
character if the sequence contains only "." characters, otherwise the
sequence will be replaced with a single "*" character.</p>
<p>A resource database never contains more than one entry for a given
ResourceName. If a resource file contains multiple lines with the same
ResourceName, the last line in the file is used.</p>
<p>Any whitespace character before or after the name or colon in a
ResourceSpec are ignored. To allow a Value to begin with whitespace, the
two-character sequence ``\ <em>space'' (backslash followed by
space)</em> is recognized and replaced by a space character, and the
two-character sequence ``\ <em>tab''</em> (backslash followed by
horizontal tab) is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab
character. To allow a Value to contain embedded newline characters, the
two-character sequence ``\ n'' is recognized and replaced by a newline
character. To allow a Value to be broken across multiple lines in a text
file, the two-character sequence ``\ <em>newline''</em> (backslash
followed by newline) is recognized and removed from the value. To allow
a Value to contain arbitrary character codes, the four-character
sequence ``\ <em>nnn'',</em> where each <em>n is a digit character in
the range of ``0''-``7'',</em> is recognized and replaced with a single
byte that contains the octal value specified by the sequence. Finally,
the two-character sequence ``\\'' is recognized and replaced with a
single backslash.</p>
<p>When an application looks for the value of a resource, it specifies a
complete path in the hierarchy, with both class and instance names.
However, resource values are usually given with only partially specified
names and classes, using pattern matching constructs. An asterisk (*) is
a loose binding and is used to represent any number of intervening
components, including none. A period (.) is a tight binding and is used
to separate immediately adjacent components. A question mark (?) is used
to match any single component name or class. A database entry cannot end
in a loose binding; the final component (which cannot be "?") must be
specified. The lookup algorithm searches the resource database for the
entry that most closely matches (is most specific for) the full name and
class being queried. When more than one database entry matches the full
name and class, precedence rules are used to select just one.</p>
<p>The full name and class are scanned from left to right (from highest
level in the hierarchy to lowest), one component at a time. At each
level, the corresponding component and/or binding of each matching entry
is determined, and these matching components and bindings are compared
according to precedence rules. Each of the rules is applied at each
level, before moving to the next level, until a rule selects a single
entry over all others. The rules (in order of precedence) are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An entry that contains a matching component (whether name, class,
or "?") takes precedence over entries that elide the level (that is,
entries that match the level in a loose binding).</p></li>
<li><p>An entry with a matching name takes precedence over both entries
with a matching class and entries that match using "?". An entry with a
matching class takes precedence over entries that match using
"?".</p></li>
<li><p>An entry preceded by a tight binding takes precedence over
entries preceded by a loose binding.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Programs based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics obtain resources from the
following sources (other programs usually support some subset of these
sources):</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>RESOURCE_MANAGER root window property</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Any global resources that should be available to clients on all
machines should be stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root
window of the first screen using the <em>xrdb program.</em> This is
frequently taken care of when the user starts up X through the display
manager or <em>xinit.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SCREEN_RESOURCES root window property</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Any resources specific to a given screen (e.g. colors) that should be
available to clients on all machines should be stored in the
SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of that screen. The
<em>xrdb program will sort resources automatically and place them</em>
in RESOURCE_MANAGER or SCREEN_RESOURCES, as appropriate.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>application-specific files</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Directories named by the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH or
the environment variable XAPPLRESDIR (which names a single directory and
should end with a '/' on POSIX systems), plus directories in a standard
place (usually under /usr/share/X11/, but this can be overridden with
the XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable) are searched for for
application-specific resources. For example, application default
resources are usually kept in /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/. See the
<em>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface manual for</em>
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XENVIRONMENT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Any user- and machine-specific resources may be specified by setting
the XENVIRONMENT environment variable to the name of a resource file to
be loaded by all applications. If this variable is not defined, a file
named <em>$HOME/.Xdefaults-hostname is looked for instead,</em> where
<em>hostname is the name of the host where the application</em> is
executing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-xrm <em>resourcestring</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Resources can also be specified from the command line. The
<em>resourcestring is a single resource name and value as</em> shown
above. Note that if the string contains characters interpreted by the
shell (e.g., asterisk), they must be quoted. Any number of
<strong>-xrm</strong> <em>arguments may be given on the</em> command
line.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Program resources are organized into groups called <em>classes, so
that</em> collections of individual resources (each of which are called
<em>instances)</em> can be set all at once. By convention, the instance
name of a resource begins with a lowercase letter and class name with an
upper case letter. Multiple word resources are concatenated with the
first letter of the succeeding words capitalized. Applications written
with the X Toolkit Intrinsics will have at least the following
resources:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>background (<em>class</em> Background)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This resource specifies the color to use for the window
background.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>borderWidth (<em>class</em> BorderWidth)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This resource specifies the width in pixels of the window border.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>borderColor (<em>class</em> BorderColor)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This resource specifies the color to use for the window border.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most applications using the X Toolkit Intrinsics also have the
resource <strong>foreground</strong> (class <strong>Foreground),
specifying the color to use for text</strong> and graphics within the
window.</p>
<p>By combining class and instance specifications, application
preferences can be set quickly and easily. Users of color displays will
frequently want to set Background and Foreground classes to particular
defaults. Specific color instances such as text cursors can then be
overridden without having to define all of the related resources. For
example,</p>
<pre><code>    bitmap*Dashed:  off
    XTerm*cursorColor:  gold
    XTerm*multiScroll:  on
    XTerm*jumpScroll:  on
    XTerm*reverseWrap:  on
    XTerm*curses:  on

    XTerm*cutNewline: off
    XTerm*cutToBeginningOfLine: off
    XTerm*titeInhibit:  on
    XTerm*ttyModes:  intr ^c erase ^? kill ^u
    XLoad*Background: gold
    XLoad*Foreground: red
    XLoad*highlight: black
    XLoad*borderWidth: 0
    emacs*Geometry:  80x65-0-0
    emacs*Background:  rgb:5b/76/86
    emacs*Foreground:  white
    emacs*Cursor:  white
    emacs*BorderColor:  white
    emacs*Font:  6x10
    xmag*geometry: -0-0
    xmag*borderColor:  white</code></pre>
<p>If these resources were stored in a file called <em>.Xresources</em>
<strong>in your home</strong> directory, they could be added to any
existing resources in the server with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>    % xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources</code></pre>
<p>This is frequently how user-friendly startup scripts merge
user-specific defaults into any site-wide defaults. All sites are
encouraged to set up convenient ways of automatically loading resources.

<strong>for more information.</strong></p>

<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
<p>A wide variety of error messages are generated from various programs.
The default error handler in <em>Xlib</em> <strong>(also used by many
toolkits) uses</strong> standard resources to construct diagnostic
messages when errors occur. The defaults for these messages are usually
stored in <em>usr/share/X11/XErrorDB</em><strong>. If this file is not
present,</strong> error messages will be rather terse and cryptic.</p>
<p>When the X Toolkit Intrinsics encounter errors converting resource
strings to the appropriate internal format, no error messages are
usually printed. This is convenient when it is desirable to have one set
of resources across a variety of displays (e.g. color vs. monochrome,
lots of fonts vs. very few, etc.), although it can pose problems for
trying to determine why an application might be failing. This behavior
can be overridden by the setting the <em>StringConversionWarnings</em>
<strong>resource.</strong></p>
<p>To force the X Toolkit Intrinsics to always print string conversion
error messages, the following resource should be placed in the file that
gets loaded onto the RESOURCE_MANAGER property using the <em>xrdb</em>
<strong>program (frequently called</strong> <em>.Xresources</em> or
<em>.Xres</em> <strong>in the user's home directory):</strong></p>
<pre><code>    *StringConversionWarnings: on</code></pre>
<p>To have conversion messages printed for just a particular
application, the appropriate instance name can be placed before the
asterisk:</p>
<pre><code>    xterm*StringConversionWarnings: on</code></pre>
