<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Generators are small executables placed in
/lib/systemd/system-generators/ and other directories listed above.
<strong>systemd</strong>(1) will execute these binaries very early at
bootup and at configuration reload time — before unit files are loaded.
Their main purpose is to convert configuration and execution context
parameters that are not native to the service manager into dynamically
generated unit files, symlinks or unit file drop-ins, so that they can
extend the unit file hierarchy the service manager subsequently loads
and operates on.</p>
<p><strong>systemd</strong> will call each generator with three
directory paths that are to be used for generator output. In these three
directories, generators may dynamically generate unit files (regular
ones, instances, as well as templates), unit file .d/ drop-ins, and
create symbolic links to unit files to add additional dependencies,
create aliases, or instantiate existing templates. Those directories are
included in the unit load path, allowing generated configuration to
extend or override existing definitions. For tests, generators may be
called with just one argument; the generator should assume that all
three paths are the same in that case.</p>
<p>Directory paths for generator output differ by priority:
.../generator.early has priority higher than the admin configuration in
/etc/, while .../generator has lower priority than /etc/ but higher than
vendor configuration in /usr/, and .../generator.late has priority lower
than all other configuration. See the next section and the discussion of
unit load paths and unit overriding in
<strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5).</p>
<p>Generators are loaded from a set of paths determined during
compilation, as listed above. System and user generators are loaded from
directories with names ending in system-generators/ and
user-generators/, respectively. Generators found in directories listed
earlier override the ones with the same name in directories lower in the
list. A symlink to /dev/null or an empty file can be used to mask a
generator, thereby preventing it from running. Please note that the
order of the two directories with the highest priority is reversed with
respect to the unit load path, and generators in /run/ overwrite those
in /etc/.</p>
<p>After installing new generators or updating the configuration,
<strong>systemctl daemon-reload</strong> may be executed. This will
delete the previous configuration created by generators, re-run all
generators, and cause <strong>systemd</strong> to reload units from
disk. See <strong>systemctl</strong>(1) for more information.</p>
<h1>OUTPUT DIRECTORIES</h1>
<p>Generators are invoked with three arguments: paths to directories
where generators can place their generated unit files or symlinks. By
default those paths are runtime directories that are included in the
search path of <strong>systemd</strong>, but a generator may be called
with different paths for debugging purposes. If only one argument is
provided, the generator should use the same directory as the the three
output paths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p><em>normal-dir</em></p>
<p>In normal use this is /run/systemd/generator in case of the system
generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator in case of the user
generators. Unit files placed in this directory take precedence over
vendor unit configuration but not over native user/administrator unit
configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p><em>early-dir</em></p>
<p>In normal use this is /run/systemd/generator.early in case of the
system generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator.early in case
of the user generators. Unit files placed in this directory override
unit files in /usr/, /run/ and /etc/. This means that unit files placed
in this directory take precedence over all normal configuration, both
vendor and user/administrator.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p><em>late-dir</em></p>
<p>In normal use this is /run/systemd/generator.late in case of the
system generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator.late in case of
the user generators. This directory may be used to extend the unit file
tree without overriding any other unit files. Any native configuration
files supplied by the vendor or user/administrator take precedence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>The service manager sets a number of environment variables when
invoking generator executables. They carry information about the
execution context of the generator, in order to simplify
conditionalizing generators to specific environments. The following
environment variables are set:</p>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_SCOPE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the generator is invoked from the system service manager this
variable is set to "system"; if invoked from the per-user service
manager it is set to "user".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_IN_INITRD</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the generator is run as part of an initrd this is set to "1". If
it is run from the regular host (i.e. after the transition from initrd
to host) it is set to "0". This environment variable is only set for
system generators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_FIRST_BOOT</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this boot-up cycle is considered a "first boot", this is set to
"1"; if it is a subsequent, regular boot it is set to "0". For details
see the documentation of <em>ConditionFirstBoot=</em> in
<strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5). This environment variable is only set
for system generators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the service manager is run in a virtualized environment,
<em>$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION</em> is set to a pair of strings, separated
by a colon. The first string is either "vm" or "container", categorizing
the type of virtualization. The second string identifies the
implementation of the virtualization technology. If no virtualization is
detected this variable will not be set. This data is identical to what
<strong>systemd-detect-virt</strong>(1) detects and reports, and uses
the same vocabulary of virtualization implementation identifiers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_ARCHITECTURE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable is set to a short identifier of the reported
architecture of the system. For details about defined values, see
documentation of <em>ConditionArchitecture=</em> in
<strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>NOTES ABOUT WRITING GENERATORS</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>All generators are executed in parallel. That means all executables
are started at the very same time and need to be able to cope with this
parallelism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Generators are run very early at boot and cannot rely on any external
services. They may not talk to any other process. That includes simple
things such as logging to <strong>syslog</strong>(3), or
<strong>systemd</strong> itself (this means: no
<strong>systemctl</strong>(1))! Non-essential file systems like /var/
and /home/ are mounted after generators have run. Generators can however
rely on the most basic kernel functionality to be available, as well as
mounted /sys/, /proc/, /dev/, /usr/ and /run/ file systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Units written by generators are removed when the configuration is
reloaded. That means the lifetime of the generated units is closely
bound to the reload cycles of <strong>systemd</strong> itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Generators should only be used to generate unit files, .d/*.conf
drop-ins for them and symlinks to them, not any other kind of non-unit
related configuration. Due to the lifecycle logic mentioned above,
generators are not a good fit to generate dynamic configuration for
other services. If you need to generate dynamic configuration for other
services, do so in normal services you order before the service in
question.</p>
<p>Note that using the
<em>StandardInputData=</em>/<em>StandardInputText=</em> settings of
service unit files (see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5)), it is
possible to make arbitrary input data (including daemon-specific
configuration) part of the unit definitions, which often might be
sufficient to embed data or configuration for other programs into unit
files in a native fashion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Since <strong>syslog</strong>(3) is not available (see above), log
messages have to be written to /dev/kmsg instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The generator should always include its own name in a comment at the
top of the generated file, so that the user can easily figure out which
component created or amended a particular unit.</p>
<p>The <em>SourcePath=</em> directive should be used in generated files
to specify the source configuration file they are generated from. This
makes things more easily understood by the user and also has the benefit
that systemd can warn the user about configuration files that changed on
disk but have not been read yet by systemd. The <em>SourcePath=</em>
value does not have to be a file in a physical filesystem. For example,
in the common case of the generator looking at the kernel command line,
<strong>SourcePath=/proc/cmdline</strong> should be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Generators may write out dynamic unit files or just hook unit files
into other units with the usual .wants/ or .requires/ symlinks. Often,
it is nicer to simply instantiate a template unit file from /usr/ with a
generator instead of writing out entirely dynamic unit files. Of course,
this works only if a single parameter is to be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>If you are careful, you can implement generators in shell scripts. We
do recommend C code however, since generators are executed synchronously
and hence delay the entire boot if they are slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Regarding overriding semantics: there are two rules we try to follow
when thinking about the overriding semantics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>User configuration should override vendor configuration. This
(mostly) means that stuff from /etc/ should override stuff from
/usr/.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Native configuration should override non-native configuration. This
(mostly) means that stuff you generate should never override native unit
files for the same purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of these two rules the first rule is probably the more important one
and breaks the second one sometimes. Hence, when deciding whether to use
argv[1], argv[2], or argv[3], your default choice should probably be
argv[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Instead of heading off now and writing all kind of generators for
legacy configuration file formats, please think twice! It is often a
better idea to just deprecate old stuff instead of keeping it
artificially alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>Example 1. systemd-fstab-generator</strong></p>
<p><strong>systemd-fstab-generator</strong>(8) converts /etc/fstab into
native mount units. It uses argv[1] as location to place the generated
unit files in order to allow the user to override /etc/fstab with their
own native unit files, but also to ensure that /etc/fstab overrides any
vendor default from /usr/.</p>
<p>After editing /etc/fstab, the user should invoke <strong>systemctl
daemon-reload</strong>. This will re-run all generators and cause
<strong>systemd</strong> to reload units from disk. To actually mount
new directories added to fstab, <strong>systemctl start</strong>
<em>/path/to/mountpoint</em> or <strong>systemctl start
local-fs.target</strong> may be used.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2. systemd-system-update-generator</strong></p>
<p><strong>systemd-system-update-generator</strong>(8) temporarily
redirects default.target to system-update.target, if a system update is
scheduled. Since this needs to override the default user configuration
for default.target, it uses argv[2]. For details about this logic, see
<strong>systemd.offline-updates</strong>(7).</p>
<p><strong>Example 3. Debugging a generator</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>dir=$(mktemp -d)
SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug /lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator \
        &quot;$dir&quot; &quot;$dir&quot; &quot;$dir&quot;
find $dir</code></pre>
