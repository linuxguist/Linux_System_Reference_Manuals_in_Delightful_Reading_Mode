<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd.system-credentials - System Credentials</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>System and Service Credentials</strong>[1] are data objects
that may be passed into booted systems or system services as they are
invoked. They can be acquired from various external sources, and
propagated into the system and from there into system services.
Credentials may optionally be encrypted with a machine-specific key
and/or locked to the local TPM2 device, and are only decrypted when the
consuming service is invoked.</p>
<p>System credentials may be used to provision and configure various
aspects of the system. Depending on the consuming component credentials
are only used on initial invocations or are needed for all
invocations.</p>
<p>Credentials may be used for any kind of data, binary or text, and may
carry passwords, secrets, certificates, cryptographic key material,
identity information, configuration, and more.</p>
<h1>WELL KNOWN SYSTEM CREDENTIALS</h1>

keymap has been configured before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>firstboot.locale</em>, <em>firstboot.locale-message</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system locale to set (e.g. "de_DE.UTF-8"). Read by

timezone has been configured before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>login.issue</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data of this credential is written to
/etc/issue.d/50-provision.conf, if the file doesnt exist yet.
<strong>agetty</strong>(8) reads this file and shows its contents at the
login prompt of terminal logins. See <strong>issue</strong>(5) for
details.</p>
<p>Consumed by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see
<strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>login.motd</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data of this credential is written to
/etc/motd.d/50-provision.conf, if the file doesnt exist yet.
<strong>pam_motd</strong>(8) reads this file and shows its contents as
"message of the day" during terminal logins. See
<strong>motd</strong>(5) for details.</p>
<p>Consumed by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see
<strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>network.hosts</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data of this credential is written to /etc/hosts, if the file
doesnt exist yet. See <strong>hosts</strong>(5) for details.</p>
<p>Consumed by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see

</blockquote>
<p><em>passwd.hashed-password.root</em>,
<em>passwd.plaintext-password.root</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May contain the password (either in UNIX hashed format, or in
plaintext) for the root users. Read by both

<strong>systemd-sysusers</strong>(1), and only honoured if no root
password has been configured before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>passwd.shell.root</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The path to the shell program (e.g. "/bin/bash") for the root user.
Read by both <strong>systemd-firstboot</strong>(1) and
<strong>systemd-sysusers</strong>(1), and only honoured if no root shell
has been configured before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ssh.authorized_keys.root</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data of this credential is written to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys,
if the file doesnt exist yet. This allows provisioning SSH access for
the systems root user.</p>
<p>Consumed by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see
<strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>sysusers.extra</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional <strong>sysusers.d</strong>(5) lines to process during
boot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>sysctl.extra</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional <strong>sysctl.d</strong>(5) lines to process during
