<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>fanotify - monitoring filesystem events</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The fanotify API provides notification and interception of filesystem
events. Use cases include virus scanning and hierarchical storage
management. In the original fanotify API, only a limited set of events
was supported. In particular, there was no support for create, delete,
and move events. The support for those events was added in Linux 5.1.
(See <strong>inotify</strong>(7) for details of an API that did notify
those events pre Linux 5.1.)</p>
<p>Additional capabilities compared to the <strong>inotify</strong>(7)
API include the ability to monitor all of the objects in a mounted
filesystem, the ability to make access permission decisions, and the
possibility to read or modify files before access by other
applications.</p>
<p>The following system calls are used with this API:
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2), <strong>fanotify_mark</strong>(2),
<strong>read</strong>(2), <strong>write</strong>(2), and
<strong>close</strong>(2).</p>
<h2>fanotify_init(), fanotify_mark(), and notification groups</h2>
<p>The <strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2) system call creates and
initializes an fanotify notification group and returns a file descriptor
referring to it.</p>
<p>An fanotify notification group is a kernel-internal object that holds
a list of files, directories, filesystems, and mounts for which events
shall be created.</p>
<p>For each entry in an fanotify notification group, two bit masks
exist: the <em>mark</em> mask and the <em>ignore</em> mask. The mark
mask defines file activities for which an event shall be created. The
ignore mask defines activities for which no event shall be generated.
Having these two types of masks permits a filesystem, mount, or
directory to be marked for receiving events, while at the same time
ignoring events for specific objects under a mount or directory.</p>
<p>The <strong>fanotify_mark</strong>(2) system call adds a file,
directory, filesystem, or mount to a notification group and specifies
which events shall be reported (or ignored), or removes or modifies such
an entry.</p>
<p>A possible usage of the ignore mask is for a file cache. Events of
interest for a file cache are modification of a file and closing of the
same. Hence, the cached directory or mount is to be marked to receive
these events. After receiving the first event informing that a file has
been modified, the corresponding cache entry will be invalidated. No
further modification events for this file are of interest until the file
is closed. Hence, the modify event can be added to the ignore mask. Upon
receiving the close event, the modify event can be removed from the
ignore mask and the file cache entry can be updated.</p>
<p>The entries in the fanotify notification groups refer to files and
directories via their inode number and to mounts via their mount ID. If
files or directories are renamed or moved within the same mount, the
respective entries survive. If files or directories are deleted or moved
to another mount or if filesystems or mounts are unmounted, the
corresponding entries are deleted.</p>
<h2>The event queue</h2>
<p>As events occur on the filesystem objects monitored by a notification
group, the fanotify system generates events that are collected in a
queue. These events can then be read (using <strong>read</strong>(2) or
similar) from the fanotify file descriptor returned by
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Two types of events are generated: <em>notification</em> events and
<em>permission</em> events. Notification events are merely informative
and require no action to be taken by the receiving application with one
exception: if a valid file descriptor is provided within a generic
event, the file descriptor must be closed. Permission events are
requests to the receiving application to decide whether permission for a
file access shall be granted. For these events, the recipient must write
a response which decides whether access is granted or not.</p>
<p>An event is removed from the event queue of the fanotify group when
it has been read. Permission events that have been read are kept in an
internal list of the fanotify group until either a permission decision
has been taken by writing to the fanotify file descriptor or the
fanotify file descriptor is closed.</p>
<h2>Reading fanotify events</h2>
<p>Calling <strong>read</strong>(2) for the file descriptor returned by
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2) blocks (if the flag
<strong>FAN_NONBLOCK</strong> is not specified in the call to
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2)) until either a file event occurs or
the call is interrupted by a signal (see
<strong>signal</strong>(7)).</p>
<p>After a successful <strong>read</strong>(2), the read buffer contains
one or more of the following structures:</p>
<pre><code>struct fanotify_event_metadata {
    __u32 event_len;
    __u8 vers;
    __u8 reserved;
    __u16 metadata_len;
    __aligned_u64 mask;
    __s32 fd;
    __s32 pid;
};</code></pre>
<p>Information records are supplemental pieces of information that may
be provided alongside the generic <em>fanotify_event_metadata</em>
structure. The <em>flags</em> passed to
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2) have influence over the type of
information records that may be returned for an event. For example, if a
notification group is initialized with <strong>FAN_REPORT_FID</strong>
or <strong>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</strong>, then event listeners should also
expect to receive a <em>fanotify_event_info_fid</em> structure alongside
the <em>fanotify_event_metadata</em> structure, whereby file handles are
used to identify filesystem objects rather than file descriptors.
Information records may also be stacked, meaning that using the various
<strong>FAN_REPORT_*</strong> flags in conjunction with one another is
supported. In such cases, multiple information records can be returned
for an event alongside the generic <em>fanotify_event_metadata</em>
structure. For example, if a notification group is initialized with
<strong>FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID</strong> and
<strong>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</strong>, then an event listener should expect
to receive up to two <em>fanotify_event_info_fid</em> information
records and one <em>fanotify_event_info_pidfd</em> information record
alongside the generic <em>fanotify_event_metadata</em> structure.
Importantly, fanotify provides no guarantee around the ordering of
information records when a notification group is initialized with a
stacked based configuration. Each information record has a nested
structure of type <em>fanotify_event_info_header</em>. It is imperative
for event listeners to inspect the <em>info_type</em> field of this
structure in order to determine the type of information record that had
been received for a given event.</p>
<p>In cases where an fanotify group identifies filesystem objects by
file handles, event listeners should also expect to receive one or more
of the below information record objects alongside the generic
<em>fanotify_event_metadata</em> structure within the read buffer:</p>
<pre><code>struct fanotify_event_info_fid {
    struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
    __kernel_fsid_t fsid;
    unsigned char file_handle[0];
};</code></pre>
<p>In cases where an fanotify group is initialized with
<strong>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</strong>, event listeners should expect to
receive the below information record object alongside the generic
<em>fanotify_event_metadata</em> structure within the read buffer:</p>
<pre><code>struct fanotify_event_info_pidfd {
        struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
        __s32 pidfd;
};</code></pre>
<p>In case of a <strong>FAN_FS_ERROR</strong> event, an additional
information record describing the error that occurred is returned
alongside the generic <em>fanotify_event_metadata</em> structure within
the read buffer. This structure is defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct fanotify_event_info_error {
    struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
    __s32 error;
    __u32 error_count;
};</code></pre>
<p>All information records contain a nested structure of type
<em>fanotify_event_info_header</em>. This structure holds
meta-information about the information record that may have been
returned alongside the generic <em>fanotify_event_metadata</em>
structure. This structure is defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct fanotify_event_info_header {
	__u8 info_type;
	__u8 pad;
	__u16 len;
};</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a large buffer size
(for example, 4096 bytes), so that multiple events can be retrieved by a
single <strong>read</strong>(2).</p>
<p>The return value of <strong>read</strong>(2) is the number of bytes
placed in the buffer, or -1 in case of an error (but see BUGS).</p>
<p>The fields of the <em>fanotify_event_metadata</em> structure are as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>event_len</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the length of the data for the current event and the offset
to the next event in the buffer. Unless the group identifies filesystem
objects by file handles, the value of <em>event_len</em> is always
<strong>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</strong>. For a group that identifies
filesystem objects by file handles, <em>event_len</em> also includes the
variable length file identifier records.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>vers</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This field holds a version number for the structure. It must be
compared to <strong>FANOTIFY_METADATA_VERSION</strong> to verify that
the structures returned at run time match the structures defined at
compile time. In case of a mismatch, the application should abandon
trying to use the fanotify file descriptor.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>reserved</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This field is not used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>metadata_len</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the length of the structure. The field was introduced to
facilitate the implementation of optional headers per event type. No
such optional headers exist in the current implementation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>mask</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a bit mask describing the event (see below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>fd</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is an open file descriptor for the object being accessed, or
<strong>FAN_NOFD</strong> if a queue overflow occurred. With an fanotify
group that identifies filesystem objects by file handles, applications
should expect this value to be set to <strong>FAN_NOFD</strong> for each
event that is received. The file descriptor can be used to access the
contents of the monitored file or directory. The reading application is
responsible for closing this file descriptor.</p>
<p>When calling <strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2), the caller may
specify (via the <em>event_f_flags</em> argument) various file status
flags that are to be set on the open file description that corresponds
to this file descriptor. In addition, the (kernel-internal)
<strong>FMODE_NONOTIFY</strong> file status flag is set on the open file
description. This flag suppresses fanotify event generation. Hence, when
the receiver of the fanotify event accesses the notified file or
directory using this file descriptor, no additional events will be
created.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pid</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If flag <strong>FAN_REPORT_TID</strong> was set in
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2), this is the TID of the thread that
caused the event. Otherwise, this the PID of the process that caused the
event.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A program listening to fanotify events can compare this PID to the
PID returned by <strong>getpid</strong>(2), to determine whether the
event is caused by the listener itself, or is due to a file access by
another process.</p>
<p>The bit mask in <em>mask</em> indicates which events have occurred
for a single filesystem object. Multiple bits may be set in this mask,
if more than one event occurred for the monitored filesystem object. In
particular, consecutive events for the same filesystem object and
originating from the same process may be merged into a single event,
with the exception that two permission events are never merged into one
queue entry.</p>
<p>The bits that may appear in <em>mask</em> are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FAN_ACCESS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file or a directory (but see BUGS) was accessed (read).</p>

<dt><strong>FAN_FS_ERROR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A filesystem error was detected.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_RENAME</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file or directory has been moved to or from a watched parent
directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_MOVED_FROM</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file or directory has been moved from a watched parent
directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_MOVED_TO</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file or directory has been moved to a watched parent directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_MOVE_SELF</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A watched file or directory was moved.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_MODIFY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file was modified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file that was opened for writing (<strong>O_WRONLY</strong> or
<strong>O_RDWR</strong>) was closed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file or directory that was opened read-only
(<strong>O_RDONLY</strong>) was closed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The event queue exceeded the limit on number of events. This limit
can be overridden by specifying the <strong>FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE</strong>
flag when calling <strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>An application wants to read a file or directory, for example using
<strong>read</strong>(2) or <strong>readdir</strong>(2). The reader must
write a response (as described below) that determines whether the
permission to access the filesystem object shall be granted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_OPEN_PERM</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>An application wants to open a file or directory. The reader must
write a response that determines whether the permission to open the
filesystem object shall be granted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>An application wants to open a file for execution. The reader must
write a response that determines whether the permission to open the
filesystem object for execution shall be granted. See NOTES in
<strong>fanotify_mark</strong>(2) for additional details.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To check for any close event, the following bit mask may be used:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FAN_CLOSE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file was closed. This is a synonym for:</p>
<pre><code>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE | FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</code></pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To check for any move event, the following bit mask may be used:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FAN_MOVE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file or directory was moved. This is a synonym for:</p>
<pre><code>FAN_MOVED_FROM | FAN_MOVED_TO</code></pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following bits may appear in <em>mask</em> only in conjunction
with other event type bits:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FAN_ONDIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The events described in the <em>mask</em> have occurred on a
directory object. Reporting events on directories requires setting this
flag in the mark mask. See <strong>fanotify_mark</strong>(2) for
additional details. The <strong>FAN_ONDIR</strong> flag is reported in
an event mask only if the fanotify group identifies filesystem objects
by file handles.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Information records that are supplied alongside the generic
<em>fanotify_event_metadata</em> structure will always contain a nested
structure of type <em>fanotify_event_info_header</em>. The fields of the
<em>fanotify_event_info_header</em> are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>info_type</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique integer value representing the type of information record
object received for an event. The value of this field can be set to one
of the following: <strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</strong>,
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</strong>,
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</strong>, or
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_PIDFD</strong>. The value set for this field
is dependent on the flags that have been supplied to
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2). Refer to the field details of each
information record object type below to understand the different cases
in which the <em>info_type</em> values can be set.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This field is currently not used by any information record object
type and therefore is set to zero.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>len</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The value of <em>len</em> is set to the size of the information
record object, including the <em>fanotify_event_info_header</em>. The
total size of all additional information records is not expected to be
larger than (<em>event_len</em> - <em>metadata_len</em>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fields of the <em>fanotify_event_info_fid</em> structure are as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>hdr</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a structure of type <em>fanotify_event_info_header</em>. For
example, when an fanotify file descriptor is created using
<strong>FAN_REPORT_FID</strong>, a single information record is expected
to be attached to the event with <em>info_type</em> field value of
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</strong>. When an fanotify file
descriptor is created using the combination of
<strong>FAN_REPORT_FID</strong> and <strong>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</strong>,
there may be two information records attached to the event: one with
<em>info_type</em> field value of
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</strong>, identifying a parent
directory object, and one with <em>info_type</em> field value of
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</strong>, identifying a child object.
Note that for the directory entry modification events
<strong>FAN_CREATE</strong>, <strong>FAN_DELETE</strong>,
<strong>FAN_MOVE</strong>, and <strong>FAN_RENAME</strong>, an
information record identifying the created/deleted/moved child object is
reported only if an fanotify group was initialized with the flag
<strong>FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>fsid</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a unique identifier of the filesystem containing the object
associated with the event. It is a structure of type
<em>__kernel_fsid_t</em> and contains the same value as <em>f_fsid</em>
when calling <strong>statfs</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>file_handle</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a variable length structure of type struct file_handle. It is
an opaque handle that corresponds to a specified object on a filesystem
as returned by <strong>name_to_handle_at</strong>(2). It can be used to
uniquely identify a file on a filesystem and can be passed as an
argument to <strong>open_by_handle_at</strong>(2). If the value of
<em>info_type</em> field is
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</strong>, the file handle is
followed by a null terminated string that identifies the
created/deleted/moved directory entry name. For other events such as
<strong>FAN_OPEN</strong>, <strong>FAN_ATTRIB</strong>,
<strong>FAN_DELETE_SELF</strong>, and <strong>FAN_MOVE_SELF</strong>, if
the value of <em>info_type</em> field is
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</strong>, the <em>file_handle</em>
identifies the object correlated to the event. If the value of
<em>info_type</em> field is <strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</strong>,
the <em>file_handle</em> identifies the directory object correlated to
the event or the parent directory of a non-directory object correlated
to the event. If the value of <em>info_type</em> field is
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</strong>, the <em>file_handle</em>
identifies the same directory object that would be reported with
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</strong> and the file handle is
followed by a null terminated string that identifies the name of a
directory entry in that directory, or '.' to identify the directory
object itself.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fields of the <em>fanotify_event_info_pidfd</em> structure are as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>hdr</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a structure of type <em>fanotify_event_info_header</em>. When
an fanotify group is initialized using
<strong>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</strong>, the <em>info_type</em> field value of
the <em>fanotify_event_info_header</em> is set to
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_PIDFD</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pidfd</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a process file descriptor that refers to the process
responsible for generating the event. The returned process file
descriptor is no different from one which could be obtained manually if
<strong>pidfd_open</strong>(2) were to be called on
<em>fanotify_event_metadata.pid</em>. In the instance that an error is
encountered during pidfd creation, one of two possible error types
represented by a negative integer value may be returned in this
<em>pidfd</em> field. In cases where the process responsible for
generating the event has terminated prior to the event listener being
able to read events from the notification queue,
<strong>FAN_NOPIDFD</strong> is returned. The pidfd creation for an
event is only performed at the time the events are read from the
notification queue. All other possible pidfd creation failures are
represented by <strong>FAN_EPIDFD</strong>. Once the event listener has
dealt with an event and the pidfd is no longer required, the pidfd
should be closed via <strong>close</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fields of the <em>fanotify_event_info_error</em> structure are as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>hdr</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a structure of type <em>fanotify_event_info_header</em>. The
<em>info_type</em> field is set to
<strong>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_ERROR</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>error</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Identifies the type of error that occurred.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>error_count</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a counter of the number of errors suppressed since the last
error was read.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following macros are provided to iterate over a buffer containing
fanotify event metadata returned by a <strong>read</strong>(2) from an
fanotify file descriptor:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FAN_EVENT_OK(meta, len)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro checks the remaining length <em>len</em> of the buffer
<em>meta</em> against the length of the metadata structure and the
<em>event_len</em> field of the first metadata structure in the
buffer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FAN_EVENT_NEXT(meta, len)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro uses the length indicated in the <em>event_len</em> field
of the metadata structure pointed to by <em>meta</em> to calculate the
address of the next metadata structure that follows <em>meta</em>.
<em>len</em> is the number of bytes of metadata that currently remain in
the buffer. The macro returns a pointer to the next metadata structure
that follows <em>meta</em>, and reduces <em>len</em> by the number of
bytes in the metadata structure that has been skipped over (i.e., it
subtracts <em>meta-&gt;event_len</em> from <em>len</em>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition, there is:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro returns the size (in bytes) of the structure
<em>fanotify_event_metadata</em>. This is the minimum size (and
currently the only size) of any event metadata.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Monitoring an fanotify file descriptor for events</h2>
<p>When an fanotify event occurs, the fanotify file descriptor indicates
as readable when passed to <strong>epoll</strong>(7),
<strong>poll</strong>(2), or <strong>select</strong>(2).</p>
<h2>Dealing with permission events</h2>
<p>For permission events, the application must <strong>write</strong>(2)
a structure of the following form to the fanotify file descriptor:</p>
<pre><code>struct fanotify_response {
    __s32 fd;
    __u32 response;
};</code></pre>
<p>The fields of this structure are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>fd</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the file descriptor from the structure
<em>fanotify_event_metadata</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>response</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This field indicates whether or not the permission is to be granted.
Its value must be either <strong>FAN_ALLOW</strong> to allow the file
operation or <strong>FAN_DENY</strong> to deny the file operation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If access is denied, the requesting application call will receive an
<strong>EPERM</strong> error. Additionally, if the notification group
has been created with the <strong>FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT</strong> flag, then
the <strong>FAN_AUDIT</strong> flag can be set in the <em>response</em>
field. In that case, the audit subsystem will log information about the
access decision to the audit logs.</p>
<h2>Monitoring filesystems for errors</h2>
<p>A single <strong>FAN_FS_ERROR</strong> event is stored per filesystem
at once. Extra error messages are suppressed and accounted for in the
<em>error_count</em> field of the existing <strong>FAN_FS_ERROR</strong>
event record, but details about the errors are lost.</p>
<p>Errors reported by <strong>FAN_FS_ERROR</strong> are generic
<em>errno</em> values, but not all kinds of error types are reported by
all filesystems.</p>
<p>Errors not directly related to a file (i.e. super block corruption)
are reported with an invalid <em>file_handle</em>. For these errors, the
<em>file_handle</em> will have the field <em>handle_type</em> set to
<strong>FILEID_INVALID</strong>, and the handle buffer size set to
<strong>0</strong>.</p>
<h2>Closing the fanotify file descriptor</h2>
<p>When all file descriptors referring to the fanotify notification
group are closed, the fanotify group is released and its resources are
freed for reuse by the kernel. Upon <strong>close</strong>(2),
outstanding permission events will be set to allowed.</p>
<h2>/proc interfaces</h2>
<p>The file <em>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/[fd]</em> contains information about
fanotify marks for file descriptor <em>fd</em> of process <em>pid</em>.
See <strong>proc</strong>(5) for details.</p>
<p>Since Linux 5.13, the following interfaces can be used to control the
amount of kernel resources consumed by fanotify:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>/proc/sys/fs/fanotify/max_queued_events</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The value in this file is used when an application calls
<strong>fanotify_init</strong>(2) to set an upper limit on the number of
events that can be queued to the corresponding fanotify group. Events in
excess of this limit are dropped, but an <strong>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</strong>
event is always generated. Prior to Linux kernel 5.13, the hardcoded
limit was 16384 events.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/sys/fs/fanotify/max_user_group</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies an upper limit on the number of fanotify groups that
can be created per real user ID. Prior to Linux kernel 5.13, the
hardcoded limit was 128 groups per user.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/sys/fs/fanotify/max_user_marks</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies an upper limit on the number of fanotify marks that
can be created per real user ID. Prior to Linux kernel 5.13, the
hardcoded limit was 8192 marks per group (not per user).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>In addition to the usual errors for <strong>read</strong>(2), the
following errors can occur when reading from the fanotify file
descriptor:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The buffer is too small to hold the event.</p>
</dd>

<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>The fanotify API was introduced in Linux 2.6.36 and enabled in Linux
2.6.37. Fdinfo support was added in Linux 3.8.</p>
<h1>STANDARDS</h1>
<p>The fanotify API is Linux-specific.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was built with the
<strong>CONFIG_FANOTIFY</strong> configuration option enabled. In
addition, fanotify permission handling is available only if the
<strong>CONFIG_FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS</strong> configuration option
is enabled.</p>
<h2>Limitations and caveats</h2>
<p>Fanotify reports only events that a user-space program triggers
through the filesystem API. As a result, it does not catch remote events
that occur on network filesystems.</p>
<p>The fanotify API does not report file accesses and modifications that
may occur because of <strong>mmap</strong>(2),
<strong>msync</strong>(2), and <strong>munmap</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Events for directories are created only if the directory itself is
opened, read, and closed. Adding, removing, or changing children of a
marked directory does not create events for the monitored directory
itself.</p>
<p>Fanotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor
subdirectories under a directory, additional marks must be created. The
<strong>FAN_CREATE</strong> event can be used for detecting when a
subdirectory has been created under a marked directory. An additional
mark must then be set on the newly created subdirectory. This approach
is racy, because it can lose events that occurred inside the newly
created subdirectory, before a mark is added on that subdirectory.
Monitoring mounts offers the capability to monitor a whole directory
tree in a race-free manner. Monitoring filesystems offers the capability
to monitor changes made from any mount of a filesystem instance in a
race-free manner.</p>
<p>The event queue can overflow. In this case, events are lost.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Before Linux 3.19, <strong>fallocate</strong>(2) did not generate
fanotify events. Since Linux 3.19, calls to
<strong>fallocate</strong>(2) generate <strong>FAN_MODIFY</strong>
events.</p>
<p>As of Linux 3.17, the following bugs exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On Linux, a filesystem object may be accessible through multiple
paths, for example, a part of a filesystem may be remounted using the
<em>--bind</em> option of <strong>mount</strong>(8). A listener that
marked a mount will be notified only of events that were triggered for a
filesystem object using the same mount. Any other event will pass
unnoticed.</p></li>
<li><p>When an event is generated, no check is made to see whether the
user ID of the receiving process has authorization to read or write the
file before passing a file descriptor for that file. This poses a
security risk, when the <strong>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</strong> capability is set
for programs executed by unprivileged users.</p></li>
<li><p>If a call to <strong>read</strong>(2) processes multiple events
from the fanotify queue and an error occurs, the return value will be
the total length of the events successfully copied to the user-space
buffer before the error occurred. The return value will not be -1, and
<em>errno</em> will not be set. Thus, the reading application has no way
to detect the error.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The two example programs below demonstrate the usage of the fanotify
API.</p>
<h2>Example program: fanotify_example.c</h2>
<p>The first program is an example of fanotify being used with its event
object information passed in the form of a file descriptor. The program
marks the mount passed as a command-line argument and waits for events
of type <strong>FAN_OPEN_PERM</strong> and
<strong>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</strong>. When a permission event occurs, a
<strong>FAN_ALLOW</strong> response is given.</p>
<p>The following shell session shows an example of running this program.
This session involved editing the file <em>/home/user/temp/notes</em>.
Before the file was opened, a <strong>FAN_OPEN_PERM</strong> event
occurred. After the file was closed, a <strong>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</strong>
event occurred. Execution of the program ends when the user presses the
ENTER key.</p>
<pre><code># ./fanotify_example /home
Press enter key to terminate.
Listening for events.
FAN_OPEN_PERM: File /home/user/temp/notes
FAN_CLOSE_WRITE: File /home/user/temp/notes

<h2>Example program: fanotify_fid.c</h2>
<p>The second program is an example of fanotify being used with a group
that identifies objects by file handles. The program marks the
filesystem object that is passed as a command-line argument and waits
until an event of type <strong>FAN_CREATE</strong> has occurred. The
event mask indicates which type of filesystem object—either a file or a
directory—was created. Once all events have been read from the buffer
and processed accordingly, the program simply terminates.</p>
<p>The following shell sessions show two different invocations of this
program, with different actions performed on a watched object.</p>
<p>The first session shows a mark being placed on <em>/home/user</em>.
This is followed by the creation of a regular file,
<em>/home/user/testfile.txt</em>. This results in a
<strong>FAN_CREATE</strong> event being generated and reported against
the file's parent watched directory object and with the created file
name. Program execution ends once all events captured within the buffer
have been processed.</p>
<pre><code># ./fanotify_fid /home/user
Listening for events.
FAN_CREATE (file created):
        Directory /home/user has been modified.
        Entry &#39;testfile.txt&#39; is not a subdirectory.
All events processed successfully. Program exiting.

$ touch /home/user/testfile.txt              # In another terminal</code></pre>
<p>The second session shows a mark being placed on <em>/home/user</em>.
This is followed by the creation of a directory,
<em>/home/user/testdir</em>. This specific action results in a
<strong>FAN_CREATE</strong> event being generated and is reported with
the <strong>FAN_ONDIR</strong> flag set and with the created directory
name.</p>
<pre><code># ./fanotify_fid /home/user
Listening for events.
FAN_CREATE | FAN_ONDIR (subdirectory created):
        Directory /home/user has been modified.
