<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
<p>Cryptographic primitives such as the SHA256 digest, or AES encryption
are referred to in OpenSSL as algorithms. There can be more than one
implementation for any given algorithm available for use.
<strong>crypto</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>ASN.1, ASN1</dt>
<dd>
<p>ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) is a notation for describing
abstract types and values. It is defined in the ITU-T documents X.680 to
X.683: &lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.680&gt;,
&lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.681&gt;,
&lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.682&gt;,
&lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.683&gt;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Base Provider</dt>
<dd>
<p>An OpenSSL Provider that contains encoders and decoders for OpenSSL
keys. All the algorithm implementations in the Base Provider are also
available in the Default Provider.
<strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-base</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Decoder</dt>
<dd>
<p>A decoder is a type of algorithm used for decoding keys and
parameters from some external format such as PEM or DER.
<strong>OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new_for_pkey</strong> (3)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Default Provider</dt>
<dd>
<p>An OpenSSL Provider that contains the most common OpenSSL algorithm
implementations. It is loaded by default if no other provider is
available. All the algorithm implementations in the Base Provider are
also available in the Default Provider.
<strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-default</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>DER ("Distinguished Encoding Rules")</dt>
<dd>
<p>DER is a binary encoding of data, structured according to an ASN.1
specification. This is a common encoding used for cryptographic objects
such as private and public keys, certificates, CRLs, ... It is defined
in ITU-T document X.690: &lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.690&gt;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Encoder</dt>
<dd>
<p>An encoder is a type of algorithm used for encoding keys and
parameters to some external format such as PEM or DER.
<strong>OSSL_ENCODER_CTX_new_for_pkey</strong> (3)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Explicit Fetching</dt>
<dd>
<p>Explicit Fetching is a type of Fetching (see Fetching). Explicit
Fetching is where a function call is made to obtain an algorithm object
representing an implementation such as <strong>EVP_MD_fetch</strong> (3)
or <strong>EVP_CIPHER_fetch</strong> (3)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fetching</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fetching is the process of looking through the available algorithm
implementations, applying selection criteria (via a property query
string), and finally choosing the implementation that will be used. Also
see Explicit Fetching and Implicit Fetching.
<strong>crypto</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>FIPS Provider</dt>
<dd>
<p>An OpenSSL Provider that contains OpenSSL algorithm implementations
that have been validated according to the FIPS 140-2 standard.
<strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Implicit Fetching</dt>
<dd>
<p>Implicit Fetching is a type of Fetching (see Fetching). Implicit
Fetching is where an algorithm object with no associated implementation
is used such as the return value from <strong>EVP_sha256</strong> (3) or
<strong>EVP_aes_128_cbc</strong> (3). With implicit fetching an
implementation is fetched automatically using default selection criteria
the first time the algorithm is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Legacy Provider</dt>
<dd>
<p>An OpenSSL Provider that contains algorithm implementations that are
considered insecure or are no longer in common use.
<strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Library Context</dt>
<dd>
<p>A Library Context in OpenSSL is represented by the type
<strong>OSSL_LIB_CTX</strong>. It can be thought of as a scope within
which configuration options apply. If an application does not explicitly
create a library context then the default one is used. Many OpenSSL
functions can take a library context as an argument. A NULL value can
always be passed to indicate the default library context.
<strong>OSSL_LIB_CTX</strong> (3)</p>
</dd>
<dt>MSBLOB</dt>
<dd>
<p>MSBLOB is a Microsoft specific binary format for RSA and DSA keys,
both private and public. This form is never passphrase protected.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Null Provider</dt>
<dd>
<p>An OpenSSL Provider that contains no algorithm implementations. This
can be useful to prevent the default provider from being automatically
loaded in a library context. <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-null</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Operation</dt>
<dd>
<p>An operation is a group of OpenSSL functions with a common purpose
such as encryption, or digesting. <strong>crypto</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>PEM ("Privacy Enhanced Message")</dt>
<dd>
<p>PEM is a format used for encoding of binary content into a mail and
ASCII friendly form. The content is a series of base64-encoded lines,
surrounded by begin/end markers each on their own line. For example:
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- MIICdg.... ... bhTQ== -----END PRIVATE
KEY----- Optional header line(s) may appear after the begin line, and
their existence depends on the type of object being written or read. For
all OpenSSL uses, the binary content is expected to be a DER encoded
structure. This is defined in IETF RFC 1421:
&lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421&gt;</p>
</dd>
<dt>PKCS#8</dt>
<dd>
<p>PKCS#8 is a specification of ASN.1 structures that OpenSSL uses for
storing or transmitting any private key in a key type agnostic manner.
There are two structures worth noting for OpenSSL use, one that contains
the key data in unencrypted form (known as PrivateKeyInfo) and an
encrypted wrapper structure (known as EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo). This is
specified in RFC 5208: &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208&gt;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Property</dt>
<dd>
<p>A property is a way of classifying and selecting algorithm
implementations. A property is a key/value pair expressed as a string.
For example all algorithm implementations in the default provider have
the property provider=default. An algorithm implementation can have
multiple properties defined against it. Also see Property Query String.
<strong>property</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Property Query String</dt>
<dd>
<p>A property query string is a string containing a sequence of
properties that can be used to select an algorithm implementation. For
example the query string provider=example,foo=bar will select algorithms
from the example provider that have a foo property defined for them with
a value of bar. Property Query Strings are used during fetching. See
Fetching. <strong>property</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Provider</dt>
<dd>
<p>A provider in OpenSSL is a component that groups together algorithm
implementations. Providers can come from OpenSSL itself or from third
parties. <strong>provider</strong> (7)</p>
</dd>
<dt>PVK</dt>
<dd>
<p>PVK is a Microsoft specific binary format for RSA and DSA private
keys. This form may be passphrase protected.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</dt>
<dd>
<p>SubjectPublicKeyInfo is an ASN.1 structure that OpenSSL uses for
storing and transmitting any public key in a key type agnostic manner.
This is specified as part of the specification for certificates, RFC
5280: &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280&gt;</p>
