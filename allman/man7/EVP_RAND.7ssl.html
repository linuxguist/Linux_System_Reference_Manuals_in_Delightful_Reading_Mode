<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>EVP_RAND - the random bit generator</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt; #include &lt;rand.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The default OpenSSL RAND method is based on the EVP_RAND classes to
provide non-deterministic inputs to other cryptographic algorithms.</p>
<p>While the RAND API is the 'frontend' which is intended to be used by
application developers for obtaining random bytes, the EVP_RAND API
serves as the 'backend', connecting the former with the operating
systems's entropy sources and providing access to deterministic random
bit generators (DRBG) and their configuration parameters. A DRBG is a
certain type of cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator
(CSPRNG), which is described in [NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1].</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Unless you have very specific requirements for your random generator,
it is in general not necessary to utilize the EVP_RAND API directly. The
usual way to obtain random bytes is to use
<strong>RAND_bytes</strong> (3) or <strong>RAND_priv_bytes</strong> (3),
see also <strong>RAND</strong> (7).</p>
<h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
<p>Typical examples for such special use cases are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You want to use your own private DRBG instances. Multiple DRBG
instances which are accessed only by a single thread provide additional
security (because their internal states are independent) and better
scalability in multithreaded applications (because they don't need to be
locked).</p></li>
<li><p>You need to integrate a previously unsupported entropy source.
Refer to <strong>provider-rand</strong> (7) for the implementation
details to support adding randomness sources to EVP_RAND.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to change the default settings of the standard OpenSSL
RAND implementation to meet specific requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>EVP_RAND CHAINING</h1>
<p>An EVP_RAND instance can be used as the entropy source of another
EVP_RAND instance, provided it has itself access to a valid entropy
source. The EVP_RAND instance which acts as entropy source is called the
<em>parent</em>, the other instance the <em>child</em>. Typically, the
child will be a DRBG because it does not make sense for the child to be
an entropy source.</p>
<p>This is called chaining. A chained EVP_RAND instance is created by
passing a pointer to the parent EVP_RAND_CTX as argument to the
<strong>EVP_RAND_CTX_new()</strong> call. It is possible to create
chains of more than two DRBG in a row. It is also possible to use any
EVP_RAND_CTX class as the parent, however, only a live entropy source
may ignore and not use its parent.</p>
<h1>THE THREE SHARED DRBG INSTANCES</h1>
<p>Currently, there are three shared DRBG instances, the
&lt;primary&gt;, &lt;public&gt;, and &lt;private&gt; DRBG. While the
&lt;primary&gt; DRBG is a single global instance, the &lt;public&gt; and
&lt;private&gt; DRBG are created per thread and accessed through
thread-local storage.</p>
<p>By default, the functions <strong>RAND_bytes</strong> (3) and
<strong>RAND_priv_bytes</strong> (3) use the thread-local &lt;public&gt;
and &lt;private&gt; DRBG instance, respectively.</p>
<h2>The &lt;primary&gt; DRBG instance</h2>
<p>The &lt;primary&gt; DRBG is not used directly by the application,
only for reseeding the two other two DRBG instances. It reseeds itself
by obtaining randomness either from os entropy sources or by consuming
randomness which was added previously by
<strong>RAND_add</strong> (3).</p>
<h2>The &lt;public&gt; DRBG instance</h2>
<p>This instance is used per default by
<strong>RAND_bytes</strong> (3).</p>
<h2>The &lt;private&gt; DRBG instance</h2>
<p>This instance is used per default by
<strong>RAND_priv_bytes</strong> (3)</p>
<h1>LOCKING</h1>
<p>The &lt;primary&gt; DRBG is intended to be accessed concurrently for
reseeding by its child DRBG instances. The necessary locking is done
internally. It is <em>not</em> thread-safe to access the &lt;primary&gt;
DRBG directly via the EVP_RAND interface. The &lt;public&gt; and
&lt;private&gt; DRBG are thread-local, i.e. there is an instance of each
per thread. So they can safely be accessed without locking via the
EVP_RAND interface.</p>
<p>Pointers to these DRBG instances can be obtained using
<strong>RAND_get0_primary()</strong>,
<strong>RAND_get0_public()</strong> and
<strong>RAND_get0_private()</strong>, respectively. Note that it is not
allowed to store a pointer to one of the thread-local DRBG instances in
a variable or other memory location where it will be accessed and used
by multiple threads.</p>
<p>All other DRBG instances created by an application don't support
locking, because they are intended to be used by a single thread.
Instead of accessing a single DRBG instance concurrently from different
threads, it is recommended to instantiate a separate DRBG instance per
thread. Using the &lt;primary&gt; DRBG as entropy source for multiple
DRBG instances on different threads is thread-safe, because the DRBG
instance will lock the &lt;primary&gt; DRBG automatically for obtaining
random input.</p>
<h1>THE OVERALL PICTURE</h1>
<p>The following picture gives an overview over how the DRBG instances
work together and are being used.</p>
<p>+--------------------+ | os entropy sources | +--------------------+
| v +-----------------------------+ RAND_add() ==&gt; &lt;primary&gt;
&lt;-| shared DRBG (with locking) | / \ +-----------------------------+
/ \ +---------------------------+ &lt;public&gt; &lt;private&gt; &lt;- |

secrets like session keys | | random generator | | and private keys for

+------------------------------------+</p>
<p>The usual way to obtain random bytes is to call RAND_bytes(...) or
RAND_priv_bytes(...). These calls are roughly equivalent to calling
EVP_RAND_generate(&lt;public&gt;, ...) and
EVP_RAND_generate(&lt;private&gt;, ...), respectively.</p>
<h1>RESEEDING</h1>
<p>A DRBG instance seeds itself automatically, pulling random input from
its entropy source. The entropy source can be either a trusted operating
system entropy source, or another DRBG with access to such a source.</p>
<p>Automatic reseeding occurs after a predefined number of generate
requests. The selection of the trusted entropy sources is configured at
build time using the --with-rand-seed option. The following sections
explain the reseeding process in more detail.</p>
<h2>Automatic Reseeding</h2>
<p>Before satisfying a generate request
(<strong>EVP_RAND_generate</strong> (3)), the DRBG reseeds itself
automatically, if one of the following conditions holds:</p>
<p>- the DRBG was not instantiated (=seeded) yet or has been
uninstantiated.</p>
<p>- the number of generate requests since the last reseeding exceeds a
certain threshold, the so called <em>reseed_interval</em>. This
behaviour can be disabled by setting the <em>reseed_interval</em> to
0.</p>
<p>- the time elapsed since the last reseeding exceeds a certain time
interval, the so called <em>reseed_time_interval</em>. This can be
disabled by setting the <em>reseed_time_interval</em> to 0.</p>
<p>- the DRBG is in an error state.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: An error state is entered if the entropy
source fails while the DRBG is seeding or reseeding. The last case
ensures that the DRBG automatically recovers from the error as soon as
the entropy source is available again.</p>
<h2>Manual Reseeding</h2>
<p>In addition to automatic reseeding, the caller can request an
immediate reseeding of the DRBG with fresh entropy by setting the
<em>prediction resistance</em> parameter to 1 when calling
<strong>EVP_RAND_generate</strong> (3).</p>
<p>The document [NIST SP 800-90C] describes prediction resistance
requests in detail and imposes strict conditions on the entropy sources
that are approved for providing prediction resistance. A request for
prediction resistance can only be satisfied by pulling fresh entropy
from a live entropy source (section 5.5.2 of [NIST SP 800-90C]). It is
up to the user to ensure that a live entropy source is configured and is
being used.</p>
<p>For the three shared DRBGs (and only for these) there is another way
to reseed them manually: If <strong>RAND_add</strong> (3) is called with
a positive <em>randomness</em> argument (or
<strong>RAND_seed</strong> (3)), then this will immediately reseed the
&lt;primary&gt; DRBG. The &lt;public&gt; and &lt;private&gt; DRBG will
detect this on their next generate call and reseed, pulling randomness
from &lt;primary&gt;.</p>
<p>The last feature has been added to support the common practice used
with previous OpenSSL versions to call <strong>RAND_add()</strong>
before calling <strong>RAND_bytes()</strong>.</p>
<h2>Entropy Input and Additional Data</h2>
<p>The DRBG distinguishes two different types of random input:
<em>entropy</em>, which comes from a trusted source, and <em>additional
input</em>', which can optionally be added by the user and is considered
untrusted. It is possible to add <em>additional input</em> not only
during reseeding, but also for every generate request.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Random Seed Source</h2>
<p>In most cases OpenSSL will automatically choose a suitable seed
source for automatically seeding and reseeding its &lt;primary&gt; DRBG.
In some cases however, it will be necessary to explicitly specify a seed
source during configuration, using the --with-rand-seed option. For more
information, see the INSTALL instructions. There are also operating
systems where no seed source is available and automatic reseeding is
disabled by default.</p>
<p>The following two sections describe the reseeding process of the
primary DRBG, depending on whether automatic reseeding is available or
not.</p>
<h2>Reseeding the primary DRBG with automatic seeding enabled</h2>
<p>Calling <strong>RAND_poll()</strong> or <strong>RAND_add()</strong>
is not necessary, because the DRBG pulls the necessary entropy from its
source automatically. However, both calls are permitted, and do reseed
the RNG.</p>
<p><strong>RAND_add()</strong> can be used to add both kinds of random
input, depending on the value of the <em>randomness</em> argument:</p>
<dl>
<dt>randomness == 0:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The random bytes are mixed as additional input into the current state
of the DRBG. Mixing in additional input is not considered a full
reseeding, hence the reseed counter is not reset.</p>
</dd>
<dt>randomness &gt; 0:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The random bytes are used as entropy input for a full reseeding
(resp. reinstantiation) if the DRBG is instantiated (resp.
uninstantiated or in an error state). The number of random bits required
for reseeding is determined by the security strength of the DRBG.
Currently it defaults to 256 bits (32 bytes). It is possible to provide
less randomness than required. In this case the missing randomness will
be obtained by pulling random input from the trusted entropy
sources.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>NOTE: Manual reseeding is *not allowed* in FIPS mode, because [NIST
SP-800-90Ar1] mandates that entropy *shall not* be provided by the
consuming application for instantiation (Section 9.1) or reseeding
(Section 9.2). For that reason, the <em>randomness</em> argument is
ignored and the random bytes provided by the
<strong>RAND_add</strong> (3) and <strong>RAND_seed</strong> (3) calls
are treated as additional data.</p>
<h2>Reseeding the primary DRBG with automatic seeding disabled</h2>
<p>Calling <strong>RAND_poll()</strong> will always fail.</p>
<p><strong>RAND_add()</strong> needs to be called for initial seeding
and periodic reseeding. At least 48 bytes (384 bits) of randomness have
to be provided, otherwise the (re-)seeding of the DRBG will fail. This
corresponds to one and a half times the security strength of the DRBG.
The extra half is used for the nonce during instantiation.</p>
<p>More precisely, the number of bytes needed for seeding depend on the
<em>security strength</em> of the DRBG, which is set to 256 by
default.</p>
