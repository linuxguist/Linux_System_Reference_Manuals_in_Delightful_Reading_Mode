<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Landlock - unprivileged access-control</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Landlock is an access-control system that enables any processes to
securely restrict themselves and their future children. Because Landlock
is a stackable Linux Security Module (LSM), it makes it possible to
create safe security sandboxes as new security layers in addition to the
existing system-wide access-controls. This kind of sandbox is expected
to help mitigate the security impact of bugs, and unexpected or
malicious behaviors in applications.</p>
<p>A Landlock security policy is a set of access rights (e.g., open a
file in read-only, make a directory, etc.) tied to a file hierarchy.
Such policy can be configured and enforced by processes for themselves
using three system calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>landlock_create_ruleset</strong>(2) creates a new
ruleset;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>landlock_add_rule</strong>(2) adds a new rule to a
ruleset;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>landlock_restrict_self</strong>(2) enforces a ruleset on
the calling thread.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to use these system calls, the running kernel must support
Landlock and it must be enabled at boot time.</p>
<h2>Landlock rules</h2>
<p>A Landlock rule describes an action on an object. An object is
currently a file hierarchy, and the related filesystem actions are
defined with access rights (see <strong>landlock_add_rule</strong>(2)).
A set of rules is aggregated in a ruleset, which can then restrict the
thread enforcing it, and its future children.</p>
<h2>Filesystem actions</h2>
<p>These flags enable to restrict a sandboxed process to a set of
actions on files and directories. Files or directories opened before the
sandboxing are not subject to these restrictions. See
<strong>landlock_add_rule</strong>(2) and
<strong>landlock_create_ruleset</strong>(2) for more context.</p>
<p>A file can only receive these access rights:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Execute a file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open a file with write access.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open a file with read access.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A directory can receive access rights related to files or
directories. The following access right is applied to the directory
itself, and the directories beneath it:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open a directory or list its content.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the following access rights only apply to the content of a
directory, not the directory itself:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove an empty directory or rename one.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Unlink (or rename) a file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_CHAR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create (or rename or link) a character device.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create (or rename) a directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create (or rename or link) a regular file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create (or rename or link) a UNIX domain socket.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_FIFO</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create (or rename or link) a named pipe.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_BLOCK</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create (or rename or link) a block device.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SYM</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create (or rename or link) a symbolic link.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Layers of file path access rights</h2>
<p>Each time a thread enforces a ruleset on itself, it updates its
Landlock domain with a new layer of policy. Indeed, this complementary
policy is composed with the potentially other rulesets already
restricting this thread. A sandboxed thread can then safely add more
constraints to itself with a new enforced ruleset.</p>
<p>One policy layer grants access to a file path if at least one of its
rules encountered on the path grants the access. A sandboxed thread can
only access a file path if all its enforced policy layers grant the
access as well as all the other system access controls (e.g., filesystem
DAC, other LSM policies, etc.).</p>
<h2>Bind mounts and OverlayFS</h2>
<p>Landlock enables restricting access to file hierarchies, which means
that these access rights can be propagated with bind mounts (cf.
<strong>mount_namespaces</strong>(7)) but not with OverlayFS.</p>
<p>A bind mount mirrors a source file hierarchy to a destination. The
destination hierarchy is then composed of the exact same files, on which
Landlock rules can be tied, either via the source or the destination
path. These rules restrict access when they are encountered on a path,
which means that they can restrict access to multiple file hierarchies
at the same time, whether these hierarchies are the result of bind
mounts or not.</p>
<p>An OverlayFS mount point consists of upper and lower layers. These
layers are combined in a merge directory, result of the mount point.
This merge hierarchy may include files from the upper and lower layers,
but modifications performed on the merge hierarchy only reflect on the
upper layer. From a Landlock policy point of view, each of the OverlayFS
layers and merge hierarchies is standalone and contains its own set of
files and directories, which is different from a bind mount. A policy
restricting an OverlayFS layer will not restrict the resulted merged
hierarchy, and vice versa. Landlock users should then only think about
file hierarchies they want to allow access to, regardless of the
underlying filesystem.</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Every new thread resulting from a <strong>clone</strong>(2) inherits
Landlock domain restrictions from its parent. This is similar to the
<strong>seccomp</strong>(2) inheritance or any other LSM dealing with
tasks' <strong>credentials</strong>(7). For instance, one process's
thread may apply Landlock rules to itself, but they will not be
automatically applied to other sibling threads (unlike POSIX thread
credential changes, cf. <strong>nptl</strong>(7)).</p>
<p>When a thread sandboxes itself, we have the guarantee that the
related security policy will stay enforced on all this thread's
descendants. This allows creating standalone and modular security
policies per application, which will automatically be composed between
themselves according to their runtime parent policies.</p>
<h2>Ptrace restrictions</h2>
<p>A sandboxed process has less privileges than a non-sandboxed process
and must then be subject to additional restrictions when manipulating
another process. To be allowed to use <strong>ptrace</strong>(2) and
related syscalls on a target process, a sandboxed process should have a
subset of the target process rules, which means the tracee must be in a
sub-domain of the tracer.</p>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>Landlock was added in Linux 5.13.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Landlock is enabled by <strong>CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK</strong>. The
<em>lsm=lsm1,...,lsmN</em> command line parameter controls the sequence
of the initialization of Linux Security Modules. It must contain the
string <em>landlock</em> to enable Landlock. If the command line
parameter is not specified, the initialization falls back to the value
of the deprecated <em>security=</em> command line parameter and further
to the value of <strong>CONFIG_LSM</strong>. We can check that Landlock
is enabled by looking for <em>landlock: Up and running.</em> in kernel
logs.</p>
<p>It is currently not possible to restrict some file-related actions
accessible through these system call families:
<strong>chdir</strong>(2), <strong>truncate</strong>(2),
<strong>stat</strong>(2), <strong>flock</strong>(2),
<strong>chmod</strong>(2), <strong>chown</strong>(2),
<strong>setxattr</strong>(2), <strong>utime</strong>(2),
<strong>ioctl</strong>(2), <strong>fcntl</strong>(2),
<strong>access</strong>(2). Future Landlock evolutions will enable to
restrict them.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>We first need to create the ruleset that will contain our rules. For
this example, the ruleset will contain rules that only allow read
actions, but write actions will be denied. The ruleset then needs to
handle both of these kinds of actions. See below for the description of
filesystem actions.</p>
<pre><code>struct landlock_ruleset_attr attr = {0};
int ruleset_fd;

attr.handled_access_fs =
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_CHAR |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_DIR |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_FIFO |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_BLOCK |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SYM;

ruleset_fd = landlock_create_ruleset(&amp;attr, sizeof(attr), 0);
if (ruleset_fd == -1) {
    perror(&quot;Failed to create a ruleset&quot;);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}</code></pre>
<p>We can now add a new rule to this ruleset thanks to the returned file
descriptor referring to this ruleset. The rule will only allow reading
the file hierarchy <em>/usr</em>. Without another rule, write actions
would then be denied by the ruleset. To add <em>/usr</em> to the
ruleset, we open it with the <em>O_PATH</em> flag and fill the
<em>struct landlock_path_beneath_attr</em> with this file
descriptor.</p>
<pre><code>struct landlock_path_beneath_attr path_beneath = {0};
int err;

path_beneath.allowed_access =
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE |
        LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR;

path_beneath.parent_fd = open(&quot;/usr&quot;, O_PATH | O_CLOEXEC);
if (path_beneath.parent_fd == -1) {
    perror(&quot;Failed to open file&quot;);
    close(ruleset_fd);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
err = landlock_add_rule(ruleset_fd, LANDLOCK_RULE_PATH_BENEATH,
                        &amp;path_beneath, 0);
close(path_beneath.parent_fd);
if (err) {
    perror(&quot;Failed to update ruleset&quot;);
    close(ruleset_fd);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}</code></pre>
<p>We now have a ruleset with one rule allowing read access to
<em>/usr</em> while denying all other handled accesses for the
filesystem. The next step is to restrict the current thread from gaining
more privileges (e.g., thanks to a set-user-ID binary).</p>
<pre><code>if (prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0)) {
    perror(&quot;Failed to restrict privileges&quot;);
    close(ruleset_fd);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}</code></pre>
<p>The current thread is now ready to sandbox itself with the
ruleset.</p>
<pre><code>if (landlock_restrict_self(ruleset_fd, 0)) {
    perror(&quot;Failed to enforce ruleset&quot;);
    close(ruleset_fd);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
close(ruleset_fd);</code></pre>
<p>If the <strong>landlock_restrict_self</strong>(2) system call
succeeds, the current thread is now restricted and this policy will be
enforced on all its subsequently created children as well. Once a thread
is landlocked, there is no way to remove its security policy; only
adding more restrictions is allowed. These threads are now in a new
Landlock domain, merge of their parent one (if any) with the new
ruleset.</p>
