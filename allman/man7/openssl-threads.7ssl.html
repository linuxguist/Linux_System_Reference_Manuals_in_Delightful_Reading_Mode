<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>openssl-threads - Overview of thread safety in OpenSSL</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In this man page, we use the term <strong>thread-safe</strong> to
indicate that an object or function can be used by multiple threads at
the same time.</p>
<p>OpenSSL can be built with or without threads support. The most
important use of this support is so that OpenSSL itself can use a single
consistent API, as shown in EXAMPLES in
<strong>CRYPTO_THREAD_run_once</strong> (3). Multi-platform applications
can also use this API.</p>
<p>In particular, being configured for threads support does not imply
that all OpenSSL objects are thread-safe. To emphasize: <em>most objects
are not safe for simultaneous use</em>. Exceptions to this should be
documented on the specific manual pages, and some general high-level
guidance is given here.</p>
<p>One major use of the OpenSSL thread API is to implement reference
counting. Many objects within OpenSSL are reference-counted, so
resources are not released, until the last reference is removed.
References are often increased automatically (such as when an
<strong>X509</strong> certificate object is added into an
<strong>X509_STORE</strong> trust store). There is often an
<strong><em>object</em>_up_ref</strong>() function that can be used to
increase the reference count. Failure to match
<strong><em>object</em>_up_ref</strong>() calls with the right number of
<strong><em>object</em>_free</strong>() calls is a common source of
memory leaks when a program exits.</p>
<p>Many objects have set and get API's to set attributes in the object.
A <code>set0</code> passes ownership from the caller to the object and a
<code>get0</code> returns a pointer but the attribute ownership remains
with the object and a reference to it is returned. A <code>set1</code>
or <code>get1</code> function does not change the ownership, but instead
updates the attribute's reference count so that the object is shared
between the caller and the object; the caller must free the returned
attribute when finished. Functions that involve attributes that have
reference counts themselves, but are named with just <code>set</code> or
<code>get</code> are historical; and the documentation must state how
the references are handled. Get methods are often thread-safe as long as
the ownership requirements are met and shared objects are not modified.
Set methods, or modifying shared objects, are generally not thread-safe
as discussed below.</p>
<p>Objects are thread-safe as long as the API's being invoked don't
modify the object; in this case the parameter is usually marked in the
API as <code>const</code>. Not all parameters are marked this way. Note
that a <code>const</code> declaration does not mean immutable; for
example <strong>X509_cmp</strong> (3) takes pointers to
<code>const</code> objects, but the implementation uses a C cast to
remove that so it can lock objects, generate and cache a DER encoding,
and so on.</p>
<p>Another instance of thread-safety is when updates to an object's
internal state, such as cached values, are done with locks. One example
of this is the reference counting API's described above.</p>
<p>In all cases, however, it is generally not safe for one thread to
mutate an object, such as setting elements of a private or public key,
while another thread is using that object, such as verifying a
signature.</p>
<p>The same API's can usually be used simultaneously on different
objects without interference. For example, two threads can calculate a
signature using two different <strong>EVP_PKEY_CTX</strong> objects.</p>
<p>For implicit global state or singletons, thread-safety depends on the
facility. The <strong>CRYPTO_secure_malloc</strong> (3) and related
API's have their own lock, while <strong>CRYPTO_malloc</strong> (3)
assumes the underlying platform allocation will do any necessary
locking. Some API's, such as <strong>NCONF_load</strong> (3) and
related, or <strong>OBJ_create</strong> (3) do no locking at all; this
can be considered a bug.</p>
<p>A separate, although related, issue is modifying factory objects when
other objects have been created from that. For example, an
<strong>SSL_CTX</strong> object created by
<strong>SSL_CTX_new</strong> (3) is used to create per-connection
<strong>SSL</strong> objects by calling <strong>SSL_new</strong> (3). In
this specific case, and probably for factory methods in general, it is
not safe to modify the factory object after it has been used to create
other objects.</p>
