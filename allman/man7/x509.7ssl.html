<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>x509 - X.509 certificate handling</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;openssl/x509.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>An X.509 certificate is a structured grouping of information about an
individual, a device, or anything one can imagine. An X.509 CRL
(certificate revocation list) is a tool to help determine if a
certificate is still valid. The exact definition of those can be found
in the X.509 document from ITU-T, or in RFC3280 from PKIX. In OpenSSL,
the type X509 is used to express such a certificate, and the type
X509_CRL is used to express a CRL.</p>
<p>A related structure is a certificate request, defined in PKCS#10 from
RSA Security, Inc, also reflected in RFC2896. In OpenSSL, the type
X509_REQ is used to express such a certificate request.</p>
<p>To handle some complex parts of a certificate, there are the types
X509_NAME (to express a certificate name), X509_ATTRIBUTE (to express a
certificate attribute), X509_EXTENSION (to express a certificate
extension) and a few more.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the supertype X509_INFO, which can contain a CRL, a
certificate and a corresponding private key.</p>
<p><strong>X509_</strong><em>XXX</em>,
<strong>d2i_X509_</strong><em>XXX</em>, and
<strong>i2d_X509_</strong><em>XXX</em> functions handle X.509
certificates, with some exceptions, shown below.</p>
<p><strong>X509_CRL_</strong><em>XXX</em>,
<strong>d2i_X509_CRL_</strong><em>XXX</em>, and
<strong>i2d_X509_CRL_</strong><em>XXX</em> functions handle X.509
CRLs.</p>
<p><strong>X509_REQ_</strong><em>XXX</em>,
<strong>d2i_X509_REQ_</strong><em>XXX</em>, and
<strong>i2d_X509_REQ_</strong><em>XXX</em> functions handle PKCS#10
certificate requests.</p>
<p><strong>X509_NAME_</strong><em>XXX</em> functions handle certificate
names.</p>
<p><strong>X509_ATTRIBUTE_</strong><em>XXX</em> functions handle
certificate attributes.</p>
<p><strong>X509_EXTENSION_</strong><em>XXX</em> functions handle
certificate extensions.</p>
