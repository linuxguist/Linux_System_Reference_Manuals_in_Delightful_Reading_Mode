<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>bio - Basic I/O abstraction</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;openssl/bio.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A BIO is an I/O abstraction, it hides many of the underlying I/O
details from an application. If an application uses a BIO for its I/O it
can transparently handle SSL connections, unencrypted network
connections and file I/O.</p>
<p>There are two types of BIO, a source/sink BIO and a filter BIO.</p>
<p>As its name implies a source/sink BIO is a source and/or sink of
data, examples include a socket BIO and a file BIO.</p>
<p>A filter BIO takes data from one BIO and passes it through to
another, or the application. The data may be left unmodified (for
example a message digest BIO) or translated (for example an encryption
BIO). The effect of a filter BIO may change according to the I/O
operation it is performing: for example an encryption BIO will encrypt
data if it is being written to and decrypt data if it is being read
from.</p>
<p>BIOs can be joined together to form a chain (a single BIO is a chain
with one component). A chain normally consists of one source/sink BIO
and one or more filter BIOs. Data read from or written to the first BIO
then traverses the chain to the end (normally a source/sink BIO).</p>
<p>Some BIOs (such as memory BIOs) can be used immediately after calling
<strong>BIO_new()</strong>. Others (such as file BIOs) need some
additional initialization, and frequently a utility function exists to
create and initialize such BIOs.</p>
<p>If <strong>BIO_free()</strong> is called on a BIO chain it will only
free one BIO resulting in a memory leak.</p>
<p>Calling <strong>BIO_free_all()</strong> on a single BIO has the same
effect as calling <strong>BIO_free()</strong> on it other than the
discarded return value.</p>
<p>Normally the <em>type</em> argument is supplied by a function which
returns a pointer to a BIO_METHOD. There is a naming convention for such
functions: a source/sink BIO typically starts with <em>BIO_s_</em> and a
filter BIO with <em>BIO_f_</em>.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Create a memory BIO:</p>
<p>BIO *mem = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());</p>
