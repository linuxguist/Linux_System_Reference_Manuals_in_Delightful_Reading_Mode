<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>termio - System V terminal driver interface</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>termio</strong> is the name of the old System V terminal
driver interface. This interface defined a <em>termio</em> structure
used to store terminal settings, and a range of
<strong>ioctl</strong>(2) operations to get and set terminal
attributes.</p>
<p>The <strong>termio</strong> interface is now obsolete: POSIX.1-1990
standardized a modified version of this interface, under the name
<strong>termios</strong>. The POSIX.1 data structure differs slightly
from the System V version, and POSIX.1 defined a suite of functions to
replace the various <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) operations that existed in
System V. (This was done because <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) was
unstandardized, and its variadic third argument does not allow argument
type checking.)</p>
<p>If you're looking for a page called "termio", then you can probably
find most of the information that you seek in either
<strong>termios</strong>(3) or <strong>ioctl_tty</strong>(2).</p>
