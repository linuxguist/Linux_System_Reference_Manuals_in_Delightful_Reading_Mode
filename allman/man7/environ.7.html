<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>environ - user environment</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>extern char **environ;</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The variable <em>environ</em> points to an array of pointers to
strings called the "environment". The last pointer in this array has the
value NULL. This array of strings is made available to the process by
the <strong>execve</strong>(2) call when a new program is started. When
a child process is created via <strong>fork</strong>(2), it inherits a
<em>copy</em> of its parent's environment.</p>
<p>By convention, the strings in <em>environ</em> have the form
"<em>name</em><strong>=</strong><em>value</em>". The name is
case-sensitive and may not contain the character "<strong>=</strong>".
The value can be anything that can be represented as a string. The name
and the value may not contain an embedded null byte ('\0'), since this
is assumed to terminate the string.</p>
<p>Environment variables may be placed in the shell's environment by the
<em>export</em> command in <strong>sh</strong>(1), or by the
<em>setenv</em> command if you use <strong>csh</strong>(1).</p>
<p>The initial environment of the shell is populated in various ways,
such as definitions from <em>/etc/environment</em> that are processed by
<strong>pam_env</strong>(8) for all users at login time (on systems that
employ <strong>pam</strong>(8)). In addition, various shell
initialization scripts, such as the system-wide <em>/etc/profile</em>
script and per-user initializations script may include commands that add
variables to the shell's environment; see the manual page of your
preferred shell for details.</p>
<p>Bourne-style shells support the syntax</p>
<pre><code>NAME=value command</code></pre>
<p>to create an environment variable definition only in the scope of the
process that executes <em>command</em>. Multiple variable definitions,
separated by white space, may precede <em>command</em>.</p>
<p>Arguments may also be placed in the environment at the point of an
<strong>exec</strong>(3). A C program can manipulate its environment
using the functions <strong>getenv</strong>(3),
<strong>putenv</strong>(3), <strong>setenv</strong>(3), and
<strong>unsetenv</strong>(3).</p>
<p>What follows is a list of environment variables typically seen on a
system. This list is incomplete and includes only common variables seen
by average users in their day-to-day routine. Environment variables
specific to a particular program or library function are documented in
the ENVIRONMENT section of the appropriate manual page.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>USER</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the logged-in user (used by some BSD-derived programs).
Set at login time, see section NOTES below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LOGNAME</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the logged-in user (used by some System-V derived
programs). Set at login time, see section NOTES below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>HOME</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A user's login directory. Set at login time, see section NOTES
below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>LANG</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of a locale to use for locale categories when not overridden
by <strong>LC_ALL</strong> or more specific environment variables such
as <strong>LC_COLLATE</strong>, <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong>,
<strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong>, <strong>LC_MONETARY</strong>,
<strong>LC_NUMERIC</strong>, and <strong>LC_TIME</strong> (see
<strong>locale</strong>(7) for further details of the
<strong>LC_*</strong> environment variables).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PATH</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The sequence of directory prefixes that <strong>sh</strong>(1) and
many other programs employ when searching for an executable file that is
specified as a simple filename (i.a., a pathname that contains no
slashes). The prefixes are separated by colons (<strong>:</strong>). The
list of prefixes is searched from beginning to end, by checking the
pathname formed by concatenating a prefix, a slash, and the filename,
until a file with execute permission is found.</p>
<p>As a legacy feature, a zero-length prefix (specified as two adjacent
colons, or an initial or terminating colon) is interpreted to mean the
current working directory. However, use of this feature is deprecated,
and POSIX notes that a conforming application shall use an explicit
pathname (e.g., <em>.</em>) to specify the current working
directory.</p>
<p>Analogously to <strong>PATH</strong>, one has <strong>CDPATH</strong>
used by some shells to find the target of a change directory command,
<strong>MANPATH</strong> used by <strong>man</strong>(1) to find manual
pages, and so on.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PWD</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Absolute path to the current working directory; required to be
partially canonical (no <em>.</em> or <em>..</em> components).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SHELL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The absolute pathname of the user's login shell. Set at login time,
see section NOTES below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TERM</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The terminal type for which output is to be prepared.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PAGER</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The user's preferred utility to display text files. Any string
acceptable as a command-string operand to the <em>sh -c</em> command
shall be valid. If <strong>PAGER</strong> is null or is not set, then
applications that launch a pager will default to a program such as
<strong>less</strong>(1) or <strong>more</strong>(1).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EDITOR</strong>/<strong>VISUAL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The user's preferred utility to edit text files. Any string
acceptable as a command_string operand to the <em>sh -c</em> command
shall be valid.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the behavior of many programs and library routines is
influenced by the presence or value of certain environment variables.
Examples include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The variables <strong>LANG</strong>, <strong>LANGUAGE</strong>,
<strong>NLSPATH</strong>, <strong>LOCPATH</strong>,
<strong>LC_ALL</strong>, <strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong>, and so on
influence locale handling; see <strong>catopen</strong>(3),
<strong>gettext</strong>(3), and <strong>locale</strong>(7).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TMPDIR</strong> influences the path prefix of names
created by <strong>tempnam</strong>(3) and other routines, and the
temporary directory used by <strong>sort</strong>(1) and other
programs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>, <strong>LD_PRELOAD</strong>,
and other <strong>LD_*</strong> variables influence the behavior of the
dynamic loader/linker. See also <strong>ld.so</strong>(8).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>POSIXLY_CORRECT</strong> makes certain programs and
library routines follow the prescriptions of POSIX.</p></li>
<li><p>The behavior of <strong>malloc</strong>(3) is influenced by
<strong>MALLOC_*</strong> variables.</p></li>
<li><p>The variable <strong>HOSTALIASES</strong> gives the name of a
file containing aliases to be used with
<strong>gethostbyname</strong>(3).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TZ</strong> and <strong>TZDIR</strong> give timezone
information used by <strong>tzset</strong>(3) and through that by
functions like <strong>ctime</strong>(3), <strong>localtime</strong>(3),
<strong>mktime</strong>(3), <strong>strftime</strong>(3). See also
<strong>tzselect</strong>(8).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TERMCAP</strong> gives information on how to address a
given terminal (or gives the name of a file containing such
information).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>COLUMNS</strong> and <strong>LINES</strong> tell
applications about the window size, possibly overriding the actual
size.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PRINTER</strong> or <strong>LPDEST</strong> may specify
the desired printer to use. See <strong>lpr</strong>(1).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Historically and by standard, <em>environ</em> must be declared in
the user program. However, as a (nonstandard) programmer convenience,
<em>environ</em> is declared in the header file
<em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em> if the <strong>_GNU_SOURCE</strong> feature
test macro is defined (see <strong>feature_test_macros</strong>(7)).</p>
<p>The <strong>prctl</strong>(2) <strong>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</strong>
and <strong>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END</strong> operations can be used to control
the location of the process's environment.</p>
<p>The <strong>HOME</strong>, <strong>LOGNAME</strong>,
<strong>SHELL</strong>, and <strong>USER</strong> variables are set when
the user is changed via a session management interface, typically by a
program such as <strong>login</strong>(1) from a user database (such as
<strong>passwd</strong>(5)). (Switching to the root user using
<strong>su</strong>(1) may result in a mixed environment where
<strong>LOGNAME</strong> and <strong>USER</strong> are retained from old
user; see the <strong>su</strong>(1) manual page.)</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Clearly there is a security risk here. Many a system command has been
tricked into mischief by a user who specified unusual values for
<strong>IFS</strong> or <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>.</p>
<p>There is also the risk of name space pollution. Programs like
<em>make</em> and <em>autoconf</em> allow overriding of default utility
names from the environment with similarly named variables in all caps.
Thus one uses <strong>CC</strong> to select the desired C compiler (and
similarly <strong>MAKE</strong>, <strong>AR</strong>,
<strong>AS</strong>, <strong>FC</strong>, <strong>LD</strong>,
<strong>LEX</strong>, <strong>RM</strong>, <strong>YACC</strong>, etc.).
However, in some traditional uses such an environment variable gives
options for the program instead of a pathname. Thus, one has
<strong>MORE</strong> and <strong>LESS</strong>. Such usage is
considered mistaken, and to be avoided in new programs.</p>
