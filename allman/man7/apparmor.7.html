<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>AppArmor - kernel enhancement to confine programs to a limited set of
resources.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>AppArmor is a kernel enhancement to confine programs to a limited set
of resources. AppArmor's unique security model is to bind access control
attributes to programs rather than to users.</p>
<p>AppArmor confinement is provided via <em>profiles</em> loaded into
the kernel via <strong>apparmor_parser</strong> (8), typically through
the <em>/etc/init.d/apparmor</em> SysV initscript, which is used like
this:</p>
<p># /etc/init.d/apparmor start # /etc/init.d/apparmor stop #
/etc/init.d/apparmor restart</p>
<p>AppArmor can operate in two modes: <em>enforcement</em>, and
<em>complain or learning</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>enforcement</em> - Profiles loaded in enforcement mode will
result in enforcement of the policy defined in the profile as well as
reporting policy violation attempts to syslogd.</p></li>
<li><p><em>complain</em> - Profiles loaded in <code>complain</code> mode
will not enforce policy. Instead, it will report policy violation
attempts. This mode is convenient for developing profiles. To manage
complain mode for individual profiles the utilities
<strong>aa-complain</strong> (8) and <strong>aa-enforce</strong> (8) can
be used. These utilities take a program name as an argument.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Profiles are traditionally stored in files in
<em>/etc/apparmor.d/</em> under filenames with the convention of
replacing the <strong>/</strong> in pathnames with <strong>.</strong>
(except for the root <strong>/</strong>) so profiles are easier to
manage (e.g. the <em>/usr/sbin/nscd</em> profile would be named
<em>usr.sbin.nscd</em>).</p>
<p>Profiles are applied to a process at <strong>exec</strong> (3) time
(as seen through the <strong>execve</strong> (2) system call): once a
profile is loaded for a program, that program will be confined on the
next <strong>exec</strong> (3). If a process is already running under a
profile, when one replaces that profile in the kernel, the updated
profile is applied immediately to that process. On the other hand, a
process that is already running unconfined cannot be confined.</p>
<p>AppArmor supports the Linux kernel's securityfs filesystem, and makes
available the list of the profiles currently loaded; to mount the
filesystem:</p>
<p># mount -tsecurityfs securityfs /sys/kernel/security $ cat
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/profiles /usr/bin/mutt /usr/bin/gpg
...</p>
<p>Normally, the initscript will mount securityfs if it has not already
been done.</p>
<p>AppArmor also restricts what privileged operations a confined process
may execute, even if the process is running as root. A confined process
cannot call the following system calls:</p>
<p>create_module(2) delete_module(2) init_module(2) ioperm(2) iopl(2)
ptrace(2) reboot(2) setdomainname(2) sethostname(2) swapoff(2) swapon(2)
sysctl(2)</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>When a confined process tries to access a file it does not have
permission to access, the kernel will report a message through audit,
similar to:</p>
<p>audit(1386511672.612:238): apparmor="DENIED" operation="exec"
parent=7589 profile="/tmp/sh" name="/bin/uname" pid=7605 comm="sh"
requested_mask="x" denied_mask="x" fsuid=0 ouid=0
audit(1386511672.613:239): apparmor="DENIED" operation="open"
parent=7589 profile="/tmp/sh" name="/bin/uname" pid=7605 comm="sh"
requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=0 ouid=0
audit(1386511772.804:246): apparmor="DENIED" operation="capable"
parent=7246 profile="/tmp/sh" pid=7589 comm="sh" pid=7589 comm="sh"
capability=2 capname="dac_override"</p>
<p>The permissions requested by the process are described in the
operation= and denied_mask= (for files - capabilities etc. use a
slightly different log format). The name and process id of the running
program are reported, as well as the profile name including any hat that
may be active, separated by //. (Name is in quotes, because the process
name is limited to 15 bytes; it is the same as reported through the
Berkeley process accounting.)</p>
<p>For confined processes running under a profile that has been loaded
in complain mode, enforcement will not take place and the log messages
reported to audit will be of the form:</p>
<p>audit(1386512577.017:275): apparmor="ALLOWED" operation="open"
parent=8012 profile="/usr/bin/du" name="/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/"
pid=8049 comm="du" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=1000 ouid=0
audit(1386512577.017:276): apparmor="ALLOWED" operation="open"
parent=8012 profile="/usr/bin/du" name="/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/"
pid=8049 comm="du" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=1000
ouid=0</p>
<p>If the userland auditd is not running, the kernel will send audit
events to klogd; klogd will send the messages to syslog, which will log
the messages with the KERN facility. Thus, REJECTING and PERMITTING
messages may go to either <em>/var/log/audit/audit.log</em> or
<em>/var/log/messages</em>, depending upon local configuration.</p>
<h1>DEBUGGING</h1>
<p>AppArmor provides a few facilities to log more information, which can
help debugging profiles.</p>
<h2>Enable debug mode</h2>
<p>When debug mode is enabled, AppArmor will log a few extra messages to
dmesg (not via the audit subsystem). For example, the logs will tell
whether environment scrubbing has been applied.</p>
<p>To enable debug mode, run:</p>
<p>echo 1 &gt; /sys/module/apparmor/parameters/debug</p>
<h2>Turn off deny audit quieting</h2>
<p>By default, operations that trigger <code>deny</code> rules are not
logged. This is called <em>deny audit quieting</em>.</p>
<p>To turn off deny audit quieting, run:</p>
<p>echo -n noquiet &gt;/sys/module/apparmor/parameters/audit</p>
<h2>Force audit mode</h2>
<p>AppArmor can log a message for every operation that triggers a rule
configured in the policy. This is called <em>force audit mode</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> Force audit mode can be extremely noisy
even for a single profile, let alone when enabled globally.</p>
<p>To set a specific profile in force audit mode, add the
<code>audit</code> flag:</p>
<p>profile foo flags=(audit) { ... }</p>
<p>To enable force audit mode globally, run:</p>
<p>echo -n all &gt; /sys/module/apparmor/parameters/audit</p>
<p>If auditd is not running, to avoid losing too many of the extra log
messages, you will likely have to turn off rate limiting by doing:</p>
<p>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit</p>
<p>But even then the kernel ring buffer may overflow and you might lose
messages.</p>
<p>Else, if auditd is running, see <strong>auditd</strong> (8) and
<strong>auditd.conf</strong> (5).</p>
