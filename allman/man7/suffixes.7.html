<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>suffixes - list of file suffixes</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>It is customary to indicate the contents of a file with the file
suffix, which (typically) consists of a period, followed by one or more
letters. Many standard utilities, such as compilers, use this to
recognize the type of file they are dealing with. The
<strong>make</strong>(1) utility is driven by rules based on file
suffix.</p>
<p>Following is a list of suffixes which are likely to be found on a
Linux system.</p>
