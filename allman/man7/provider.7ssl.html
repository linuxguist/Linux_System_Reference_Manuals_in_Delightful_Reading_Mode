<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>provider - OpenSSL operation implementation providers</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;openssl/provider.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>This page contains information useful to provider authors.</p>
<p>A <em>provider</em>, in OpenSSL terms, is a unit of code that
provides one or more implementations for various operations for diverse
algorithms that one might want to perform.</p>
<p>An <em>operation</em> is something one wants to do, such as
encryption and decryption, key derivation, MAC calculation, signing and
verification, etc.</p>
<p>An <em>algorithm</em> is a named method to perform an operation. Very
often, the algorithms revolve around cryptographic operations, but may
also revolve around other types of operation, such as managing certain
types of objects.</p>
<p>See <strong>crypto</strong> (7) for further details.</p>
<h2>Provider</h2>
<p>A <em>provider</em> offers an initialization function, as a set of
base functions in the form of an <strong>OSSL_DISPATCH</strong> (3)
array, and by extension, a set of <strong>OSSL_ALGORITHM</strong> (3)s
(see <strong>openssl-core.h</strong> (7)). It may be a dynamically
loadable module, or may be built-in, in OpenSSL libraries or in the
application. If it's a dynamically loadable module, the initialization
function must be named <code>OSSL_provider_init</code> and must be
exported. If it's built-in, the initialization function may have any
name.</p>
<p>The initialization function must have the following signature:</p>
<p>int NAME(const OSSL_CORE_HANDLE *handle, const OSSL_DISPATCH *in,
const OSSL_DISPATCH **out, void **provctx);</p>
<p><em>handle</em> is the OpenSSL library object for the provider, and
works as a handle for everything the OpenSSL libraries need to know
about the provider. For the provider itself, it is passed to some of the
functions given in the dispatch array <em>in</em>.</p>
<p><em>in</em> is a dispatch array of base functions offered by the
OpenSSL libraries, and the available functions are further described in
<strong>provider-base</strong> (7).</p>
<p><em>*out</em> must be assigned a dispatch array of base functions
that the provider offers to the OpenSSL libraries. The functions that
may be offered are further described in
<strong>provider-base</strong> (7), and they are the central means of
communication between the OpenSSL libraries and the provider.</p>
<p><em>*provctx</em> should be assigned a provider specific context to
allow the provider multiple simultaneous uses. This pointer will be
passed to various operation functions offered by the provider.</p>
<p>Note that the provider will not be made available for applications to
use until the initialization function has completed and returned
successfully.</p>
<p>One of the functions the provider offers to the OpenSSL libraries is
the central mechanism for the OpenSSL libraries to get access to
operation implementations for diverse algorithms. Its referred to with
the number <strong>OSSL_FUNC_PROVIDER_QUERY_OPERATION</strong> and has
the following signature:</p>
<p>const OSSL_ALGORITHM *provider_query_operation(void *provctx, int
operation_id, const int *no_store);</p>
<p><em>provctx</em> is the provider specific context that was passed
back by the initialization function.</p>
<p><em>operation_id</em> is an operation identity (see Operations
below).</p>
<p><em>no_store</em> is a flag back to the OpenSSL libraries which, when
nonzero, signifies that the OpenSSL libraries will not store a reference
to the returned data in their internal store of implementations.</p>
<p>The returned <strong>OSSL_ALGORITHM</strong> (3) is the foundation of
any OpenSSL library API that uses providers for their implementation,
most commonly in the <em>fetching</em> type of functions (see ALGORITHM
FETCHING in <strong>crypto</strong> (7)).</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>Operations are referred to with numbers, via macros with names
starting with <code>OSSL_OP_</code>.</p>
<p>With each operation comes a set of defined function types that a
provider may or may not offer, depending on its needs.</p>

</dl>
<p><em>Algorithm naming</em></p>
<p>Algorithm names are case insensitive. Any particular algorithm can
have multiple aliases associated with it. The canonical OpenSSL naming
scheme follows this format:</p>
<p>ALGNAME[VERSION?][-SUBNAME[VERSION?]?][-SIZE?][-MODE?]</p>
<p>VERSION is only present if there are multiple versions of an
algorithm (e.g. MD2, MD4, MD5). It may be omitted if there is only one
version.</p>
<p>SUBNAME may be present where multiple algorithms are combined
together, e.g. MD5-SHA1.</p>
<p>SIZE is only present if multiple versions of an algorithm exist with
different sizes (e.g. AES-128-CBC, AES-256-CBC)</p>
<p>MODE is only present where applicable.</p>
<p>Other aliases may exist for example where standards bodies or common
practice use alternative names or names that OpenSSL has used
historically.</p>
<h1>OPENSSL PROVIDERS</h1>
