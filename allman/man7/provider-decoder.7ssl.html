<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>The term decode is used throughout this manual. This includes but
is</em> not limited to deserialization as individual decoders can also
do decoding into intermediate data formats.</p>
<p>The DECODER operation is a generic method to create a provider-native
object reference or intermediate decoded data from an encoded form read
from the given <strong>OSSL_CORE_BIO</strong>. If the caller wants to
decode data from memory, it should provide a
<strong>BIO_s_mem</strong> (3) <strong>BIO</strong>. The decoded data or
object reference is passed along with eventual metadata to the
<em>metadata_cb</em> as <strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) parameters.</p>
<p>The decoder doesn't need to know more about the
<strong>OSSL_CORE_BIO</strong> pointer than being able to pass it to the
appropriate BIO upcalls (see Core functions in
<strong>provider-base</strong> (7)).</p>
<p>The DECODER implementation may be part of a chain, where data is
passed from one to the next. For example, there may be an implementation
to decode an object from PEM to DER, and another one that decodes DER to
a provider-native object.</p>
<p>The last decoding step in the decoding chain is usually supposed to
create a provider-native object referenced by an object reference. To
import that object into a different provider the
<strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_export_object()</strong> can be called as the
final step of the decoding process.</p>
<p>All functions mentioned here are passed as function pointers between
<em>libcrypto</em> and the provider in
<strong>OSSL_DISPATCH</strong> (3) arrays via
<strong>OSSL_ALGORITHM</strong> (3) arrays that are returned by the
provider's <strong>provider_query_operation()</strong> function (see
Provider Functions in <strong>provider-base</strong> (7)).</p>
<p>All these functions have a corresponding function type definition
named <strong>OSSL_FUNC_{name}_fn</strong>, and a helper function to
retrieve the function pointer from an <strong>OSSL_DISPATCH</strong> (3)
element named <strong>OSSL_FUNC_{name}</strong>. For example, the
function <strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_decode()</strong> has these:</p>
<p>typedef int (OSSL_FUNC_decoder_decode_fn)(void *ctx, OSSL_CORE_BIO
*in, int selection, OSSL_CALLBACK *data_cb, void *data_cbarg,
OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK *cb, void *cbarg); static ossl_inline
OSSL_FUNC_decoder_decode_fn* OSSL_FUNC_decoder_decode(const
OSSL_DISPATCH *opf);</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_DISPATCH</strong> (3) arrays are indexed by numbers that
are provided as macros in <strong>openssl-core_dispatch.h</strong> (7),
as follows:</p>
<p>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_get_params OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_GET_PARAMS
OSSL_FUNC_decoder_gettable_params OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_GETTABLE_PARAMS
OSSL_FUNC_decoder_newctx OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_NEWCTX
OSSL_FUNC_decoder_freectx OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_FREECTX
OSSL_FUNC_decoder_set_ctx_params OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_SET_CTX_PARAMS
OSSL_FUNC_decoder_settable_ctx_params
OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_SETTABLE_CTX_PARAMS OSSL_FUNC_decoder_does_selection

OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_DECODE OSSL_FUNC_decoder_export_object
OSSL_FUNC_DECODER_EXPORT_OBJECT</p>
<h2>Names and properties</h2>
<p>The name of an implementation should match the target type of object
it decodes. For example, an implementation that decodes an RSA key
should be named RSA. Likewise, an implementation that decodes DER data
from PEM input should be named DER.</p>
<p>Properties can be used to further specify details about an
implementation:</p>
<dl>
<dt>input</dt>
<dd>
<p>This property is used to specify what format of input the
implementation can decode. This property is <em>mandatory</em>. OpenSSL
providers recognize the following input types:</p>
<dl>
<dt>pem</dt>
<dd>
<p>An implementation with that input type decodes PEM formatted
data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>der</dt>
<dd>
<p>An implementation with that input type decodes DER formatted
data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>msblob</dt>
<dd>
<p>An implementation with that input type decodes MSBLOB formatted
data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvk</dt>
<dd>
<p>An implementation with that input type decodes PVK formatted
data.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>structure</dt>
<dd>
<p>This property is used to specify the structure that the decoded data
is expected to have. This property is <em>optional</em>. Structures
currently recognised by built-in decoders:</p>
<dl>
<dt>"type-specific"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type specific structure.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"pkcs8"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Structure according to the PKCS#8 specification.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"SubjectPublicKeyInfo"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Encoding of public keys according to the Subject Public Key Info of
RFC 5280.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The possible values of both these properties is open ended. A
provider may very well specify input types and structures that libcrypto
doesn't know anything about.</p>
<h2>Subset selections</h2>
<p>Sometimes, an object has more than one subset of data that is
interesting to treat separately or together. It's possible to specify
what subsets are to be decoded, with a set of bits <em>selection</em>
that are passed in an <strong>int</strong>.</p>
<p>This set of bits depend entirely on what kind of provider-side object
is to be decoded. For example, those bits are assumed to be the same as
those used with <strong>provider-keymgmt</strong> (7) (see Key Objects
in <strong>provider-keymgmt</strong> (7)) when the object is an
asymmetric keypair - e.g.,
<strong>OSSL_KEYMGMT_SELECT_PRIVATE_KEY</strong> if the object to be
decoded is supposed to contain private key components.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_does_selection()</strong> should tell if a
particular implementation supports any of the combinations given by
<em>selection</em>.</p>
<h2>Context functions</h2>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_newctx()</strong> returns a context to be
used with the rest of the functions.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_freectx()</strong> frees the given
<em>ctx</em> as created by
<strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_newctx()</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_set_ctx_params()</strong> sets context data
according to parameters from <em>params</em> that it recognises.
Unrecognised parameters should be ignored. Passing NULL for
<em>params</em> should return true.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_settable_ctx_params()</strong> returns a
constant <strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) array describing the parameters
that <strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_set_ctx_params()</strong> can handle.</p>
<p>See <strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) for further details on the
parameters structure used by
<strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_set_ctx_params()</strong> and
<strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_settable_ctx_params()</strong>.</p>
<h2>Export function</h2>
<p>When a provider-native object is created by a decoder it would be
unsuitable for direct use with a foreign provider. The export function
allows for exporting the object into that foreign provider if the
foreign provider supports the type of the object and provides an import
function.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_export_object()</strong> should export the
object of size <em>objref_sz</em> referenced by <em>objref</em> as an
<strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) array and pass that into the
<em>export_cb</em> as well as the given <em>export_cbarg</em>.</p>
<h2>Decoding functions</h2>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_decode()</strong> should decode the data as
read from the <strong>OSSL_CORE_BIO</strong> <em>in</em> to produce
decoded data or an object to be passed as reference in an
<strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) array along with possible other metadata
that was decoded from the input. This <strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3)
array is then passed to the <em>data_cb</em> callback. The
<em>selection</em> bits, if relevant, should determine what the input
data should contain. The decoding functions also take an
<strong>OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK</strong> (3) function pointer along
with a pointer to application data <em>cbarg</em>, which should be used
when a pass phrase prompt is needed.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that the return value from this function
is interpreted as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>True (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This means carry on the decoding process, and is meaningful even
though this function couldn't decode the input into anything, because
there may be another decoder implementation that can decode it into
something. The <em>data_cb</em> callback should never be called when
this function can't decode the input into anything.</p>
</dd>
<dt>False (0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This means stop the decoding process, and is meaningful when the
input could be decoded into some sort of object that this function
understands, but further treatment of that object results into errors
that won't be possible for some other decoder implementation to get a
different result.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The conditions to stop the decoding process are at the discretion of
the implementation.</p>
<h2>Decoder operation parameters</h2>
<p>There are currently no operation parameters currently recognised by
the built-in decoders.</p>
<p>Parameters currently recognised by the built-in pass phrase
callback:</p>
<dl>
<dt>"info" (OSSL_PASSPHRASE_PARAM_INFO) &lt;UTF8 string&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>A string of information that will become part of the pass phrase
prompt. This could be used to give the user information on what kind of
object it's being prompted for.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_newctx()</strong> returns a pointer to a
context, or NULL on failure.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_set_ctx_params()</strong> returns 1, unless
a recognised parameter was invalid or caused an error, for which 0 is
returned.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_settable_ctx_params()</strong> returns a
pointer to an array of constant <strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3)
elements.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_does_selection()</strong> returns 1 if the
decoder implementation supports any of the <em>selection</em> bits,
otherwise 0.</p>
<p><strong>OSSL_FUNC_decoder_decode()</strong> returns 1 to signal that
the decoding process should continue, or 0 to signal that it should
stop.</p>
