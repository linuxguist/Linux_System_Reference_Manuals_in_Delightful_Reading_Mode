<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>openssl/core_names.h - OpenSSL provider parameter names</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;openssl/core_names.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>&lt;openssl/core_names.h&gt;</em> header defines a multitude
of macros for <strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) names, algorithm names and
other known names used with OpenSSL's providers, made available for
practical purposes only.</p>
<p>Existing names are further described in the manuals for OpenSSL's
providers (see SEE ALSO) and the manuals for each algorithm they provide
(listed in those provider manuals).</p>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p><strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-default</strong> (7),
<strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS</strong> (7),
<strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy</strong> (7)</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The macros described here were added in OpenSSL 3.0.</p>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p><em>This header file does not constitute a general registry of
names</em>. Providers that implement new algorithms are to be
responsible for their own parameter names.</p>
<p>However, authors of provider that implement their own variants of
algorithms that OpenSSL providers support will want to pay attention to
the names provided in this header to work in a compatible manner.</p>
