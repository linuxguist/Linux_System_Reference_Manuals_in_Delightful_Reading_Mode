<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>XConsortium - X Consortium information</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Releases 6.0 through 6.3 of X Version 11 were brought to you by the X
Consortium, Inc.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware
membership corporation. It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the
MIT X Consortium. The purpose of the X Consortium was to foster the
development, evolution, and maintenance of the X Window System, a
comprehensive set of vendor-neutral, system-architecture neutral,
network-transparent windowing and user interface standards.</p>
<p>The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
support further development of the X Window System. In 1992, MIT and the
membership decided it was in their best interests to move the consortium
out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization. All
rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc.
on January 1, 1994. X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors on December 31,
1996. All rights to the X Window System have been assigned to the Open
Software Foundation.</p>
<p>The X Consortium was financially self-supporting through membership
fees. There are no license fees associated with the use of X Window
System standards and code developed by the X Consortium. Membership in
the X Consortium was open to any organization willing to execute a
membership agreement.</p>
<p>The X Consortium was a highly participative body. Members were
encouraged to actively cooperate with the staff and other members in the
design and review of proposed specifications, and in the design, coding
and testing of sample implementations of those specifications.</p>
<p>The X Consortium accomplished most of its work using electronic mail
over the Internet, with individual mailing lists for working groups.
Internet electronic mail connectivity was viewed as a requirement for
useful participation in X Consortium activities. Meetings were held as
necessary, often in conjunction with industry conferences and trade
shows.</p>
