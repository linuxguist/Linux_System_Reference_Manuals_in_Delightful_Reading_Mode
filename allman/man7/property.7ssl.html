<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>property - Properties, a selection mechanism for algorithm
implementations</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>As of OpenSSL 3.0, a new method has been introduced to decide which
of multiple implementations of an algorithm will be used. The method is
centered around the concept of properties. Each implementation defines a
number of properties and when an algorithm is being selected, filters
based on these properties can be used to choose the most appropriate
implementation of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Properties are like variables, they are referenced by name and have a
value assigned.</p>
<h2>Property Names</h2>
<p>Property names fall into two categories: those reserved by the
OpenSSL project and user defined names. A <em>reserved</em> property
name consists of a single C-style identifier (except for leading
underscores not being permitted), which begins with a letter and can be
followed by any number of letters, numbers and underscores. Property
names are case-insensitive, but OpenSSL will only use lowercase
letters.</p>
<p>A <em>user defined</em> property name is similar, but it
<strong>must</strong> consist of two or more C-style identifiers,
separated by periods. The last identifier in the name can be considered
the 'true' property name, which is prefixed by some sort of 'namespace'.
Providers for example could include their name in the prefix and use
property names like</p>
<p>&lt;provider_name&gt;.&lt;property_name&gt;
&lt;provider_name&gt;.&lt;algorithm_name&gt;.&lt;property_name&gt;</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>A <em>property</em> is a <em>name=value</em> pair. A <em>property
definition</em> is a sequence of comma separated properties. There can
be any number of properties in a definition, however each name must be
unique. For example: " defines an empty property definition (i.e., no
restriction); my.foo=bar" defines a property named <em>my.foo</em> which
has a string value <em>bar</em> and iteration.count=3 defines a property
named <em>iteration.count</em> which has a numeric value of <em>3</em>.
The full syntax for property definitions appears below.</p>
<h2>Implementations</h2>
<p>Each implementation of an algorithm can define any number of
properties. For example, the default provider defines the property
<em>provider=default</em> for all of its algorithms. Likewise, OpenSSL's
FIPS provider defines <em>provider=fips</em> and the legacy provider
defines <em>provider=legacy</em> for all of their algorithms.</p>
<h2>Queries</h2>
<p>A <em>property query clause</em> is a single conditional test. For
example, fips=yes, provider!=default or ?iteration.count=3. The first
two represent mandatory clauses, such clauses <strong>must</strong>
match for any algorithm to even be under consideration. The third clause
represents an optional clause. Matching such clauses is not a
requirement, but any additional optional match counts in favor of the
algorithm. More details about that in the <strong>Lookups</strong>
section. A <em>property query</em> is a sequence of comma separated
property query clauses. It is an error if a property name appears in
more than one query clause. The full syntax for property queries appears
below, but the available syntactic features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>=</strong> is an infix operator providing an equality
test.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>!=</strong> is an infix operator providing an inequality
test.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>?</strong> is a prefix operator that means that the
following clause is optional but preferred.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>-</strong> is a prefix operator that means any global
query clause involving the following property name should be
ignored.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>...</strong> is a quoted string. The quotes are not
included in the body of the string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>'...'</strong> is a quoted string. The quotes are not
included in the body of the string.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lookups</h2>
<p>When an algorithm is looked up, a property query is used to determine
the best matching algorithm. All mandatory query clauses
<strong>must</strong> be present and the implementation that
additionally has the largest number of matching optional query clauses
will be used. If there is more than one such optimal candidate, the
result will be chosen from amongst those in an indeterminate way.
Ordering of optional clauses is not significant.</p>
<h2>Shortcut</h2>
<p>In order to permit a more concise expression of boolean properties,
there is one short cut: a property name alone (e.g. my.property) is
exactly equivalent to my.property=yes in both definitions and
queries.</p>
<h2>Global and Local</h2>
<p>Two levels of property query are supported. A context based property
query that applies to all fetch operations and a local property query.
Where both the context and local queries include a clause with the same
name, the local clause overrides the context clause.</p>
<p>It is possible for a local property query to remove a clause in the
context property query by preceding the property name with a '-'. For
example, a context property query that contains fips=yes would normally
result in implementations that have fips=yes.</p>
<p>However, if the setting of the fips property is irrelevant to the
operations being performed, the local property query can include the
clause -fips. Note that the local property query could not use fips=no
because that would disallow any implementations with fips=yes rather
than not caring about the setting.</p>
<h1>SYNTAX</h1>
<p>The lexical syntax in EBNF is given by:</p>
<p>Definition ::= PropertyName ( = Value )? ( , PropertyName ( = Value
)? )* Query ::= PropertyQuery ( , PropertyQuery )* PropertyQuery ::= -
PropertyName | ?? ( PropertyName (( = | != ) Value)?) Value ::=
NumberLiteral | StringLiteral StringLiteral ::= QuotedString |
UnquotedString QuotedString ::= " [^"]* " | "" [^]* "" UnquotedString
::= [A-Za-z] [^{space},]+ NumberLiteral ::= 0 ( [0-7]* | x [0-9A-Fa-f]+
) | -? [1-9] [0-9]+ PropertyName ::= [A-Za-z] [A-Za-z0-9_]* ( . [A-Za-z]
[A-Za-z0-9_]* )*</p>
