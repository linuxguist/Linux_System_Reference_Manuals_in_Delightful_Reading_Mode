<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>RAND - the OpenSSL random generator</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Random numbers are a vital part of cryptography, they are needed to
provide unpredictability for tasks like key generation, creating salts,
and many more. Software-based generators must be seeded with external
randomness before they can be used as a cryptographically-secure
pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). The availability of common
hardware with special instructions and modern operating systems, which
may use items such as interrupt jitter and network packet timings, can
be reasonable sources of seeding material.</p>
<p>OpenSSL comes with a default implementation of the RAND API which is
based on the deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) model as
described in [NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1]. The default random generator will
initialize automatically on first use and will be fully functional
without having to be initialized ('seeded') explicitly. It seeds and
reseeds itself automatically using trusted random sources provided by
the operating system.</p>
<p>As a normal application developer, you do not have to worry about any
details, just use <strong>RAND_bytes</strong> (3) to obtain random data.
Having said that, there is one important rule to obey: Always check the
error return value of <strong>RAND_bytes</strong> (3) and do not take
randomness for granted. Although (re-)seeding is automatic, it can fail
because no trusted random source is available or the trusted source(s)
temporarily fail to provide sufficient random seed material. In this
case the CSPRNG enters an error state and ceases to provide output,
until it is able to recover from the error by reseeding itself. For more
details on reseeding and error recovery, see
<strong>EVP_RAND</strong> (7).</p>
<p>For values that should remain secret, you can use
<strong>RAND_priv_bytes</strong> (3) instead. This method does not
provide 'better' randomness, it uses the same type of CSPRNG. The
intention behind using a dedicated CSPRNG exclusively for private values
is that none of its output should be visible to an attacker (e.g., used
as salt value), in order to reveal as little information as possible
about its internal state, and that a compromise of the public CSPRNG
instance will not affect the secrecy of these private values.</p>
<p>In the rare case where the default implementation does not satisfy
your special requirements, the default RAND internals can be replaced by
your own <strong>EVP_RAND</strong> (3) objects.</p>
<p>Changing the default random generator should be necessary only in
exceptional cases and is not recommended, unless you have a profound
knowledge of cryptographic principles and understand the implications of
your changes.</p>
<h1>DEFAULT SETUP</h1>
<p>The default OpenSSL RAND method is based on the EVP_RAND
deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) classes. A DRBG is a certain
type of cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator
(CSPRNG), which is described in [NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1].</p>
