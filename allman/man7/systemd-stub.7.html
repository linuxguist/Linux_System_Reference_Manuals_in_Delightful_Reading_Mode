<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-stub</strong> (stored in per-architecture files
linuxx64.efi.stub, linuxia32.efi.stub, linuxaa64.efi.stub on disk) is a
simple UEFI boot stub. An UEFI boot stub is attached to a Linux kernel
binary image, and is a piece of code that runs in the UEFI firmware
environment before transitioning into the Linux kernel environment. The
UEFI boot stub ensures a Linux kernel is executable as regular UEFI
binary, and is able to do various preparations before switching the
system into the Linux world.</p>
<p>The UEFI boot stub looks for various resources for the kernel
invocation inside the UEFI PE binary itself. This allows combining
various resources inside a single PE binary image (usually called
"Unified Kernel Image", or "UKI" for short), which may then be signed
via UEFI SecureBoot as a whole, covering all individual resources at
once. Specifically it may include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The ELF Linux kernel images will be looked for in the ".linux" PE
section of the executed image.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>OS release information, i.e. the <strong>os-release</strong>(5) file
of the OS the kernel belongs to, in the ".osrel" PE section.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The initrd will be loaded from the ".initrd" PE section.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>A compiled binary DeviceTree will be looked for in the ".dtb" PE
section.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>The kernel command line to pass to the invoked kernel will be looked
for in the ".cmdline" PE section.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>A boot splash (in Windows .BMP format) to show on screen before
invoking the kernel will be looked for in the ".splash" PE section.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>A set of cryptographic signatures for expected TPM2 PCR values when
this kernel is booted, in JSON format, in the ".pcrsig" section. This is
useful for implementing TPM2 policies that bind disk encryption and
similar to kernels that are signed by a specific key.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>A public key in PEM format matching this TPM2 PCR signature data in
the ".pcrpkey" section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If UEFI SecureBoot is enabled and the ".cmdline" section is present
in the executed image, any attempts to override the kernel command line
by passing one as invocation parameters to the EFI binary are ignored.
Thus, in order to allow overriding the kernel command line, either
disable UEFI SecureBoot, or dont include a kernel command line PE
section in the kernel image file. If a command line is accepted via EFI
invocation parameters to the EFI binary it is measured into TPM PCR 12
(if a TPM is present).</p>
<p>If a DeviceTree is embedded in the ".dtb" section, it replaces an
existing DeviceTree in the corresponding EFI configuration table.
systemd-stub will ask the firmware via the "EFI_DT_FIXUP_PROTOCOL" for
hardware specific fixups to the DeviceTree.</p>
<p>The contents of seven of these eight PE sections are measured into
TPM PCR 11, that is otherwise not used. Thus, it can be pre-calculated
without too much effort. The ".pcrsig" section is not included in this
PCR measurement, since its supposed to contain signatures for the
expected results for these measurements, i.e. of the outputs of the
measurement operation, and thus cannot also be input to it.</p>
<p>When ".pcrsig" and/or ".pcrpkey" are present in a unified kernel
image their contents are passed to the booted kernel in an synthetic
initrd cpio archive that places them in the
/.extra/tpm2-pcr-signature.json and /.extra/tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem
files. Typically, a <strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5) line then ensures
they are copied into /run/systemd/tpm2-pcr-signature.json and
/run/systemd/tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem where they remain accessible even
after the system transitions out of the initrd environment into the host
file system. Tools such <strong>systemd-cryptsetup@.service</strong>(8),
<strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong>(1) and
<strong>systemd-creds</strong>(1) will automatically use files present
under these paths to unlock protected resources (encrypted storage or
credentials) or bind encryption to booted kernels.</p>
<h1>COMPANION FILES</h1>
<p>The <strong>systemd-stub</strong> UEFI boot stub automatically
collects two types of auxiliary companion files optionally placed in
drop-in directories on the same partition as the EFI binary, dynamically
generates <strong>cpio</strong> initrd archives from them, and passes
them to the kernel. Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>For a kernel binary called <em>foo</em>.efi, it will look for files
with the .cred suffix in a directory named <em>foo</em>.efi.extra.d/
next to it. A <strong>cpio</strong> archive is generated from all files
found that way, placing them in the /.extra/credentials/ directory of
the initrd file hierarchy. The main initrd may then access them in this
directory. This is supposed to be used to store auxiliary, encrypted,
authenticated credentials for use with <em>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</em>
in the UEFI System Partition. See <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) and
<strong>systemd-creds</strong>(1) for details on encrypted credentials.
The generated <strong>cpio</strong> archive is measured into TPM PCR 12
(if a TPM is present).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Similarly, files <em>foo</em>.efi.extra.d/*.raw are packed up in a
<strong>cpio</strong> archive and placed in the /.extra/sysext/
directory in the initrd file hierarchy. This is supposed to be used to
pass additional system extension images to the initrd. See
<strong>systemd-sysext</strong>(8) for details on system extension
images. The generated <strong>cpio</strong> archive containing these
system extension images is measured into TPM PCR 13 (if a TPM is
present).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Files /loader/credentials/*.cred are packed up in a
<strong>cpio</strong> archive and placed in the
/.extra/global_credentials/ directory of the initrd file hierarchy. This
is supposed to be used to pass additional credentials to the initrd,
regardless of the kernel being booted. The generated
<strong>cpio</strong> archive is measured into TPM PCR 12 (if a TPM is
present)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These mechanisms may be used to parameterize and extend trusted (i.e.
signed), immutable initrd images in a reasonably safe way: all data they
contain is measured into TPM PCRs. On access they should be further
validated: in case of the credentials case by encrypting/authenticating
them via TPM, as exposed by <strong>systemd-creds encrypt -T</strong>
(see <strong>systemd-creds</strong>(1) for details); in case of the
system extension images by using signed Verity images.</p>
<h1>TPM PCR NOTES</h1>
<p>Note that when a unified kernel using <strong>systemd-stub</strong>
is invoked the firmware will measure it as a whole to TPM PCR 4,
covering all embedded resources, such as the stub code itself, the core
kernel, the embedded initrd and kernel command line (see above for a
full list).</p>
<p>Also note that the Linux kernel will measure all initrds it receives
into TPM PCR 9. This means every type of initrd will be measured two or
three times: the initrd embedded in the kernel image will be measured to
PCR 4, PCR 9 and PCR 11; the initrd synthesized from credentials will be
measured to both PCR 9 and PCR 12; the initrd synthesized from system
extensions will be measured to both PCR 4 and PCR 9. Lets summarize the
OS resources and the PCRs they are measured to:</p>

<h1>EFI VARIABLES</h1>
<p>The following EFI variables are defined, set and read by
<strong>systemd-stub</strong>, under the vendor UUID
"4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4f", for communication between the
boot stub and the OS:</p>
<p><em>LoaderDevicePartUUID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contains the partition UUID of the EFI System Partition the EFI image
was run from. <strong>systemd-gpt-auto-generator</strong>(8) uses this
information to automatically find the disk booted from, in order to
discover various other partitions on the same disk automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>LoaderFirmwareInfo</em>, <em>LoaderFirmwareType</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brief firmware information. Use <strong>bootctl</strong>(1) to view
this data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>LoaderImageIdentifier</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The path of EFI executable, relative to the EFI System Partitions
root directory. Use <strong>bootctl</strong>(1) to view this data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>StubInfo</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brief stub information. Use <strong>bootctl</strong>(1) to view this
data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>StubPcrKernelImage</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PCR register index the kernel image, initrd image, boot splash,
devicetree database, and the embedded command line are measured into,
formatted as decimal ASCII string (e.g. "11"). This variable is set if a
measurement was successfully completed, and remains unset otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>StubPcrKernelParameters</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PCR register index the kernel command line and credentials are
measured into, formatted as decimal ASCII string (e.g. "12"). This
variable is set if a measurement was successfully completed, and remains
unset otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>StubPcrInitRDSysExts</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PCR register index the systemd extensions for the initrd, which
are picked up from the file system the kernel image is located on.
Formatted as decimal ASCII string (e.g. "13"). This variable is set if a
measurement was successfully completed, and remains unset otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that some of the variables above may also be set by the boot
loader. The stub will only set them if they arent set already. Some of
these variables are defined by the <strong>Boot Loader
Interface</strong>[1].</p>
<h1>INITRD RESOURCES</h1>
<p>The following resources are passed as initrd cpio archives to the
booted kernel, and thus make up the initial file system hierarchy in the
initrd execution environment:</p>
<p>/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main initrd from the ".initrd" PE section of the unified kernel
image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/.extra/credentials/*.cred</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Credential files (suffix ".cred") that are placed next to the unified
kernel image (as described above) are copied into the
/.extra/credentials/ directory in the initrd execution environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/.extra/global_credentials/*.cred</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar, credential files in the /loader/credentials/ directory in
the file system the unified kernel image is placed in are copied into
the /.extra/global_credentials/ directory in the initrd execution
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/.extra/sysext/*.raw</p>
<blockquote>
<p>System extension image files (suffix ".raw") that are placed next to
the unified kernel image (as described above) are copied into the
/.extra/sysext/ directory in the initrd execution environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/.extra/tpm2-pcr-signature.json</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TPM2 PCR signature JSON object included in the ".pcrsig" PE
section of the unified kernel image is copied into the
/.extra/tpm2-pcr-signature.json file in the initrd execution
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/.extra/tpm2-pcr-pkey.pem</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PEM public key included in the ".pcrpkey" PE section of the
unified kernel image is copied into the /.extra/tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem
file in the initrd execution environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that all these files are located in the "tmpfs" file system the
kernel sets up for the initrd file hierarchy and are thus lost when the
system transitions from the initrd execution environment into the host
file system. If these resources shall be kept around over this
transition they need to be copied to a place that survives the
transition first, for example via a suitable
<strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5) line. By default, this is done for the
TPM2 PCR signature and public key files.</p>
<h1>ASSEMBLING KERNEL IMAGES</h1>
<p>In order to assemble an UEFI PE kernel image from various components
as described above, use an <strong>objcopy</strong>(1) command line like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>objcopy \
    --add-section .osrel=os-release --change-section-vma .osrel=0x20000 \
    --add-section .cmdline=cmdline.txt --change-section-vma .cmdline=0x30000 \
    --add-section .dtb=devicetree.dtb --change-section-vma .dtb=0x40000 \
    --add-section .splash=splash.bmp --change-section-vma .splash=0x100000 \
    --add-section .linux=vmlinux --change-section-vma .linux=0x2000000 \
    --add-section .initrd=initrd.cpio --change-section-vma .initrd=0x3000000 \
    /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.efi.stub \
    foo-unsigned.efi</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that these PE section offsets are example values and a properly
assembled image must not contain any overlapping sections (this includes
already existing sections inside the stub before assembly) or boot may
fail.</p>
<p>This generates one PE executable file foo-unsigned.efi from the six
individual files for OS release information, kernel command line, boot
splash image, kernel image, main initrd and UEFI boot stub.</p>
<p>To then sign the resulting image for UEFI SecureBoot use an
<strong>sbsign</strong>(1) command like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>sbsign \
    --key mykey.pem \
    --cert mykey.crt \
    --output foo.efi \
    foo-unsigned.efi</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This expects a pair of X.509 private key and certificate as
parameters and then signs the UEFI PE executable we generated above for
UEFI SecureBoot and generates a signed UEFI PE executable as result.</p>
<p>See <strong>systemd-measure</strong>(1) for an example involving the
".pcrsig" and ".pcrpkey" sections.</p>
