<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>provider-object - A specification for a provider-native object
abstraction</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;openssl/core_object.h&gt; #include
&lt;openssl/core_names.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The provider-native object abstraction is a set of
<strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) keys and values that can be used to pass
provider-native objects to OpenSSL library code or between different
provider operation implementations with the help of OpenSSL library
code.</p>
<p>The intention is that certain provider-native operations can pass any
sort of object that belong with other operations, or with OpenSSL
library code.</p>
<p>An object may be passed in the following manners:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>By value</em> This means that the <em>object data</em> is
passed as an octet string or an UTF8 string, which can be handled in
diverse ways by other provided implementations. The encoding of the
object depends on the context it's used in; for example,
<strong>OSSL_DECODER</strong> (3) allows multiple encodings, depending
on existing decoders. If central OpenSSL library functionality is to
handle the data directly, it <strong>must</strong> be encoded in DER for
all object types except for <strong>OSSL_OBJECT_NAME</strong> (see
Parameter reference below), where it's assumed to a plain UTF8
string.</p></li>
<li><p><em>By reference</em> This means that the <em>object data</em>
isn't passed directly, an <em>object</em> reference is passed instead.
It's an octet string that only the correct provider understands
correctly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Objects <em>by value</em> can be used by anything that handles DER
encoded objects.</p>
<p>Objects <em>by reference</em> need a higher level of cooperation from
the implementation where the object originated (let's call it X) and its
target implementation (let's call it Y):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>An object loading function in the target implementation</em>
The target implementation (Y) may have a function that can take an
<em>object</em> reference. This can only be used if the target
implementation is from the same provider as the one originating the
object abstraction in question (X). The exact target implementation to
use is determined from the <em>object type</em> and possibly the
<em>object data type</em>. For example, when the OpenSSL library
receives an object abstraction with the <em>object type</em>
<strong>OSSL_OBJECT_PKEY</strong>, it will fetch a
<strong>provider-keymgmt</strong> (7) using the <em>object data
type</em> as its key type (the second argument in
<strong>EVP_KEYMGMT_fetch</strong> (3)).</p></li>
<li><p><em>An object exporter in the originating implementation</em> The
originating implementation (X) may have an exporter function. This
exporter function can be used to export the object in
<strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) form, that can then be imported by the
target implementation's imported function. This can be used when it's
not possible to fetch the target implementation (Y) from the same
provider.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Parameter reference</h2>
<p>A provider-native object abstraction is an
<strong>OSSL_PARAM</strong> (3) with a selection of the following
parameters:</p>
<dl>
<dt>"data" (OSSL_OBJECT_PARAM_DATA) &lt;octet string&gt; or &lt;UTF8
string&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The object data <em>passed by value</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"reference" (OSSL_OBJECT_PARAM_REFERENCE) &lt;octet string&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The object data <em>passed by reference</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"type" (OSSL_OBJECT_PARAM_TYPE) &lt;integer&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>object type</em>, a number that may have any of the following
values (all defined in <em>&lt;openssl/core_object.h&gt;</em>):</p>
<dl>
<dt>OSSL_OBJECT_NAME</dt>
<dd>
<p>The object data may only be <em>passed by value</em>, and should be a
UTF8 string. This is useful for <strong>provider-storemgmt</strong> (7)
when a URI load results in new URIs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OSSL_OBJECT_PKEY</dt>
<dd>
<p>The object data is suitable as provider-native
<strong>EVP_PKEY</strong> key data. The object data may be <em>passed by
value</em> or <em>passed by reference</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OSSL_OBJECT_CERT</dt>
<dd>
<p>The object data is suitable as <strong>X509</strong> data. The object
data for this object type can only be <em>passed by value</em>, and
should be an octet string. Since there's no provider-native X.509
object, OpenSSL libraries that receive this object abstraction are
expected to convert the data to a <strong>X509</strong> object with
<strong>d2i_X509()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OSSL_OBJECT_CRL</dt>
<dd>
<p>The object data is suitable as <strong>X509_CRL</strong> data. The
object data can only be <em>passed by value</em>, and should be an octet
string. Since there's no provider-native X.509 CRL object, OpenSSL
libraries that receive this object abstraction are expected to convert
the data to a <strong>X509_CRL</strong> object with
<strong>d2i_X509_CRL()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>"data-type" (OSSL_OBJECT_PARAM_DATA_TYPE) &lt;UTF8 string&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The specific type of the object content. Legitimate values depend on
the object type; if it is <strong>OSSL_OBJECT_PKEY</strong>, the data
type is expected to be a key type suitable for fetching a
<strong>provider-keymgmt</strong> (7) that can handle the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"data-structure" (OSSL_OBJECT_PARAM_DATA_STRUCTURE) &lt;UTF8
string&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The outermost structure of the object content. Legitimate values
depend on the object type.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"desc" (OSSL_OBJECT_PARAM_DESC) &lt;UTF8 string&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>A human readable text that describes extra details on the object.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a provider-native object abstraction is used, it <em>must</em>
contain object data in at least one form (object data <em>passed by
value</em>, i.e. the data item, or object data <em>passed by
reference</em>, i.e. the reference item). Both may be present at once,
in which case the OpenSSL library code that receives this will use the
most optimal variant.</p>
<p>For objects with the object type <strong>OSSL_OBJECT_NAME</strong>,
that object type <em>must</em> be given.</p>
