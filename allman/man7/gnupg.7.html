<h1>NAME</h1>
<p><strong>GnuPG</strong> - The GNU Privacy Guard suite of programs</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>GnuPG is a set of programs for public key encryption and digital
signatures. The program most users will want to use is the OpenPGP
command line tool, named <strong>gpg2</strong>. <strong>gpgv</strong>is
a stripped down version of <strong>gpg2</strong> with no encryption
functionality, used only to verify signatures against a trusted keyring.
<strong>gpgsm</strong> is the X.509/CMS (for S/MIME) counterpart of
<strong>gpg2</strong>. <strong>gpg-agent</strong> is a passphrase and
private key daemon which may also emulate the
<strong>ssh-agent</strong>.</p>
