<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The Open Group's X Project Team was created as the successor to the X
Consortium, Inc., after the X Consortium ceased operations and

(hereinafter called "X.Org") was created as the successor to The X
Project Team after the The Open Group ceased operating The X Project
Team. The purpose of X.Org was to foster development, evolution, and
maintenance of the X Window System. X.Org operates under the corporate

<p>The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware
membership corporation. It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the
MIT X Consortium.</p>
<p>The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
support further development of the X Window System. In 1992, MIT and the
membership decided it was in their best interests to move the consortium
out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization. All
rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc.
on January 1, 1994. On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc. closed
its doors and all rights to the X Window System were assigned to The
Open Group.</p>
