<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Xsecurity - X display access control</p>
<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>X provides mechanism for implementing many access control systems.
The sample implementation includes five mechanisms:</p>
<pre><code>

    Host Access	Simple host-based access control.
    MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1	Shared plain-text &quot;cookies&quot;.
    XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1	Secure DES based private-keys.
    SUN-DES-1	Based on Sun&#39;s secure rpc system.
    Server Interpreted	Server-dependent methods of access control</code></pre>
<p>Not all of these are available in all builds or implementations.</p>
<h1>ACCESS SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Host Access</dt>
<dd>
<p>Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed
access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in an
environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a single person
can log in to a given machine, and is easy to use when the list of hosts
used is small. This system does not work well when multiple people can
log in to a single machine and mutual trust does not exist. The list of
allowed hosts is stored in the X server and can be changed with the
<em>xhost</em> command. The list is stored in the server by network
address, not host names, so is not automatically updated if a host
changes address while the server is running. When using the more secure
mechanisms listed below, the host list is normally configured to be the
empty list, so that only authorized programs can connect to the display.
See the GRANTING ACCESS section of the <em>Xserver</em> man page for
details on how this list is initialized at server startup.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</dt>
<dd>
<p>When using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, the client sends a 128 bit "cookie"
along with the connection setup information. If the cookie presented by
the client matches one that the X server has, the connection is allowed
access. The cookie is chosen so that it is hard to guess; <em>xdm</em>
generates such cookies automatically when this form of access control is
used. The user's copy of the cookie is usually stored in the
<em>.Xauthority</em> file in the home directory, although the
environment variable <strong>XAUTHORITY</strong> can be used to specify
an alternate location. <em>Xdm</em> automatically passes a cookie to the
server for each new login session, and stores the cookie in the user
file at login.</p>
<p>The cookie is transmitted on the network without encryption, so there
is nothing to prevent a network snooper from obtaining the data and
using it to gain access to the X server. This system is useful in an
environment where many users are running applications on the same
machine and want to avoid interference from each other, with the caveat
that this control is only as good as the access control to the physical
network. In environments where network-level snooping is difficult, this
system can work reasonably well.</p>
</dd>
<dt>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sites who compile with DES support can use a DES-based access control
mechanism called XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1. It is similar in usage to
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 in that a key is stored in the <em>.Xauthority</em>
file and is shared with the X server. However, this key consists of two
parts - a 56 bit DES encryption key and 64 bits of random data used as
the authenticator.</p>
<p>When connecting to the X server, the application generates 192 bits
of data by combining the current time in seconds (since 00:00 1/1/1970
GMT) along with 48 bits of "identifier". For TCP/IPv4 connections, the
identifier is the address plus port number; for local connections it is
the process ID and 32 bits to form a unique id (in case multiple
connections to the same server are made from a single process). This 192
bit packet is then encrypted using the DES key and sent to the X server,
which is able to verify if the requestor is authorized to connect by
decrypting with the same DES key and validating the authenticator and
additional data. This system is useful in many environments where
host-based access control is inappropriate and where network security
cannot be ensured.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SUN-DES-1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Recent versions of SunOS (and some other systems) have included a
secure public key remote procedure call system. This system is based on
the notion of a network principal; a user name and NIS domain pair.
Using this system, the X server can securely discover the actual user
name of the requesting process. It involves encrypting data with the X
server's public key, and so the identity of the user who started the X
server is needed for this; this identity is stored in the
<em>.Xauthority</em> file. By extending the semantics of "host address"
to include this notion of network principal, this form of access control
is very easy to use.</p>
<p>To allow access by a new user, use <em>xhost</em>. For example,</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>    xhost keith@ ruth@mit.edu</code></pre>
<p>adds "keith" from the NIS domain of the local machine, and "ruth" in
the "mit.edu" NIS domain. For keith or ruth to successfully connect to
the display, they must add the principal who started the server to their
<em>.Xauthority</em> file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    xauth add expo.lcs.mit.edu:0 SUN-DES-1 unix.expo.lcs.mit.edu@our.domain.edu</code></pre>
<p>This system only works on machines which support Secure RPC, and only
for users which have set up the appropriate public/private key pairs on
their system. See the Secure RPC documentation for details. To access
the display from a remote host, you may have to do a <em>keylogin</em>
on the remote host first.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Server Interpreted</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Server Interpreted method provides two strings to the X server
for entry in the access control list. The first string represents the
type of entry, and the second string contains the value of the entry.
These strings are interpreted by the server and different
implementations and builds may support different types of entries. The
types supported in the sample implementation are defined in the SERVER
INTERPRETED ACCESS TYPES section below. Entries of this type can be
manipulated via <em>xhost</em>. For example to add a Server Interpreted
entry of type localuser with a value of root, the command is
<strong>xhost +si:localuser:root</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>THE AUTHORIZATION FILE</h1>
<p>Except for Host Access control and Server Interpreted Access Control,
each of these systems uses data stored in the <em>.Xauthority</em> file
to generate the correct authorization information to pass along to the X
server at connection setup. MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 and XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1
store secret data in the file; so anyone who can read the file can gain
access to the X server. SUN-DES-1 stores only the identity of the
principal who started the server (unix.<em>hostname</em>@<em>domain</em>
when the server is started by <em>xdm</em>), and so it is not useful to
anyone not authorized to connect to the server.</p>
<p>Each entry in the <em>.Xauthority</em> file matches a certain
connection family (TCP/IP, DECnet or local connections) and X display
name (hostname plus display number). This allows multiple authorization
entries for different displays to share the same data file. A special
connection family (FamilyWild, value 65535) causes an entry to match
every display, allowing the entry to be used for all connections. Each
entry additionally contains the authorization name and whatever private
authorization data is needed by that authorization type to generate the
correct information at connection setup time.</p>
<p>The <em>xauth</em> program manipulates the <em>.Xauthority</em> file
format. It understands the semantics of the connection families and
address formats, displaying them in an easy to understand format. It
also understands that SUN-DES-1 uses string values for the authorization
data, and displays them appropriately.</p>
<p>The X server (when running on a workstation) reads authorization
information from a file name passed on the command line with the
<em>-auth</em> option (see the <em>Xserver</em> manual page). The
authorization entries in the file are used to control access to the
server. In each of the authorization schemes listed above, the data
needed by the server to initialize an authorization scheme is identical
to the data needed by the client to generate the appropriate
authorization information, so the same file can be used by both
processes. This is especially useful when <em>xinit</em> is used.</p>
<dl>
<dt>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This system uses 128 bits of data shared between the user and the X
server. Any collection of bits can be used. <em>Xdm</em> generates these
keys using a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator,
and so the key to the next session cannot be computed from the current
session key.</p>
</dd>
<dt>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This system uses two pieces of information. First, 64 bits of random
data, second a 56 bit DES encryption key (again, random data) stored in
8 bytes, the last byte of which is ignored. <em>Xdm</em> generates these
keys using the same random number generator as is used for
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SUN-DES-1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This system needs a string representation of the principal which
identifies the associated X server. This information is used to encrypt
the client's authority information when it is sent to the X server. When
<em>xdm</em> starts the X server, it uses the root principal for the
machine on which it is running (unix.<em>hostname</em>@<em>domain</em>,
e.g., "unix.expire.lcs.mit.edu@our.domain.edu"). Putting the correct
principal name in the <em>.Xauthority</em> file causes Xlib to generate
the appropriate authorization information using the secure RPC
library.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>SERVER INTERPRETED ACCESS TYPES</h1>
<p>The sample implementation includes several Server Interpreted
mechanisms:</p>
<pre><code>

    IPv6	IPv6 literal addresses
    hostname	Network host name
    localuser	Local connection user id
    localgroup	Local connection group id</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt>IPv6</dt>
<dd>
<p>A literal IPv6 address as defined in IETF RFC 3513. This allows
adding IPv6 addresses when the X server supports IPv6, but the xhost
client was compiled without IPv6 support.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hostname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value must be a hostname as defined in IETF RFC 2396. Due to
Mobile IP and dynamic DNS, the name service is consulted at connection
authentication time, unlike the traditional host access control list
which only contains numeric addresses and does not automatically update
when a host's address changes. Note that this definition of hostname
does not allow use of literal IP addresses.</p>
</dd>
<dt>localuser &amp; localgroup</dt>
<dd>
<p>On systems which can determine in a secure fashion the credentials of
a client process, the "localuser" and "localgroup" authentication
methods provide access based on those credentials. The format of the
values provided is platform specific. For POSIX &amp; UNIX platforms, if
the value starts with the character '#', the rest of the string is
treated as a decimal uid or gid, otherwise the string is defined as a
user name or group name.</p>
<p>If your system supports this method and you use it, be warned that
some programs that proxy connections and are setuid or setgid may get
authenticated as the uid or gid of the proxy process. For instance, some
versions of ssh will be authenticated as the user root, no matter what
user is running the ssh client, so on systems with such software, adding
access for localuser:root may allow wider access than intended to the X
display.</p>
