<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>mount_namespaces - overview of Linux mount namespaces</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>For an overview of namespaces, see
<strong>namespaces</strong>(7).</p>
<p>Mount namespaces provide isolation of the list of mounts seen by the
processes in each namespace instance. Thus, the processes in each of the
mount namespace instances will see distinct single-directory
hierarchies.</p>
<p>The views provided by the <em>/proc/</em>pid<em>/mounts</em>,
<em>/proc/</em>pid<em>/mountinfo</em>, and
<em>/proc/</em>pid<em>/mountstats</em> files (all described in
<strong>proc</strong>(5)) correspond to the mount namespace in which the
process with the PID <em>pid</em> resides. (All of the processes that
reside in the same mount namespace will see the same view in these
files.)</p>
<p>A new mount namespace is created using either
<strong>clone</strong>(2) or <strong>unshare</strong>(2) with the
<strong>CLONE_NEWNS</strong> flag. When a new mount namespace is
created, its mount list is initialized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the namespace is created using <strong>clone</strong>(2), the
mount list of the child's namespace is a copy of the mount list in the
parent process's mount namespace.</p></li>
<li><p>If the namespace is created using <strong>unshare</strong>(2),
the mount list of the new namespace is a copy of the mount list in the
caller's previous mount namespace.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequent modifications to the mount list (<strong>mount</strong>(2)
and <strong>umount</strong>(2)) in either mount namespace will not (by
default) affect the mount list seen in the other namespace (but see the
following discussion of shared subtrees).</p>
<h1>SHARED SUBTREES</h1>
<p>After the implementation of mount namespaces was completed,
experience showed that the isolation that they provided was, in some
cases, too great. For example, in order to make a newly loaded optical
disk available in all mount namespaces, a mount operation was required
in each namespace. For this use case, and others, the shared subtree
feature was introduced in Linux 2.6.15. This feature allows for
automatic, controlled propagation of <strong>mount</strong>(2) and
<strong>umount</strong>(2) <em>events</em> between namespaces (or, more
precisely, between the mounts that are members of a <em>peer group</em>
that are propagating events to one another).</p>
<p>Each mount is marked (via <strong>mount</strong>(2)) as having one of
the following <em>propagation types</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>MS_SHARED</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mount shares events with members of a peer group.
<strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>umount</strong>(2) events
immediately under this mount will propagate to the other mounts that are
members of the peer group. <em>Propagation</em> here means that the same
<strong>mount</strong>(2) or <strong>umount</strong>(2) will
automatically occur under all of the other mounts in the peer group.
Conversely, <strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>umount</strong>(2)
events that take place under peer mounts will propagate to this
mount.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MS_PRIVATE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mount is private; it does not have a peer group.
<strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>umount</strong>(2) events do not
propagate into or out of this mount.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MS_SLAVE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>umount</strong>(2) events
propagate into this mount from a (master) shared peer group.
<strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>umount</strong>(2) events under
this mount do not propagate to any peer.</p>
<p>Note that a mount can be the slave of another peer group while at the
same time sharing <strong>mount</strong>(2) and
<strong>umount</strong>(2) events with a peer group of which it is a
member. (More precisely, one peer group can be the slave of another peer
group.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MS_UNBINDABLE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is like a private mount, and in addition this mount can't be
bind mounted. Attempts to bind mount this mount
(<strong>mount</strong>(2) with the <strong>MS_BIND</strong> flag) will
fail.</p>
<p>When a recursive bind mount (<strong>mount</strong>(2) with the
<strong>MS_BIND</strong> and <strong>MS_REC</strong> flags) is performed
on a directory subtree, any bind mounts within the subtree are
automatically pruned (i.e., not replicated) when replicating that
subtree to produce the target subtree.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For a discussion of the propagation type assigned to a new mount, see
NOTES.</p>
<p>The propagation type is a per-mount-point setting; some mounts may be
marked as shared (with each shared mount being a member of a distinct
peer group), while others are private (or slaved or unbindable).</p>
<p>Note that a mount's propagation type determines whether
<strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>umount</strong>(2) of mounts
<em>immediately under</em> the mount are propagated. Thus, the
propagation type does not affect propagation of events for grandchildren
and further removed descendant mounts. What happens if the mount itself
is unmounted is determined by the propagation type that is in effect for
the <em>parent</em> of the mount.</p>
<p>Members are added to a <em>peer group</em> when a mount is marked as
shared and either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the mount is replicated during the creation of a new mount
namespace; or</p></li>
<li><p>a new bind mount is created from the mount.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In both of these cases, the new mount joins the peer group of which
the existing mount is a member.</p>
<p>A new peer group is also created when a child mount is created under
an existing mount that is marked as shared. In this case, the new child
mount is also marked as shared and the resulting peer group consists of
all the mounts that are replicated under the peers of parent mounts.</p>
<p>A mount ceases to be a member of a peer group when either the mount
is explicitly unmounted, or when the mount is implicitly unmounted
because a mount namespace is removed (because it has no more member
processes).</p>
<p>The propagation type of the mounts in a mount namespace can be
discovered via the "optional fields" exposed in
<em>/proc/</em>pid<em>/mountinfo</em>. (See <strong>proc</strong>(5) for
details of this file.) The following tags can appear in the optional
fields for a record in that file:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>shared:X</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mount is shared in peer group <em>X</em>. Each peer group has a
unique ID that is automatically generated by the kernel, and all mounts
in the same peer group will show the same ID. (These IDs are assigned
starting from the value 1, and may be recycled when a peer group ceases
to have any members.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>master:X</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mount is a slave to shared peer group <em>X</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>propagate_from:X</em> (since Linux 2.6.26)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This mount is a slave and receives propagation from shared peer group
<em>X</em>. This tag will always appear in conjunction with a
<em>master:X</em> tag. Here, <em>X</em> is the closest dominant peer
group under the process's root directory. If <em>X</em> is the immediate
master of the mount, or if there is no dominant peer group under the
same root, then only the <em>master:X</em> field is present and not the
<em>propagate_from:X</em> field. For further details, see below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>unbindable</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is an unbindable mount.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If none of the above tags is present, then this is a private
mount.</p>
<h2>MS_SHARED and MS_PRIVATE example</h2>
<p>Suppose that on a terminal in the initial mount namespace, we mark
one mount as shared and another as private, and then view the mounts in
<em>/proc/self/mountinfo</em>:</p>
<pre><code>sh1# mount --make-shared /mntS
sh1# mount --make-private /mntP
sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
77 61 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
83 61 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime</code></pre>
<p>From the <em>/proc/self/mountinfo</em> output, we see that
<em>/mntS</em> is a shared mount in peer group 1, and that
<em>/mntP</em> has no optional tags, indicating that it is a private
mount. The first two fields in each record in this file are the unique
ID for this mount, and the mount ID of the parent mount. We can further
inspect this file to see that the parent mount of <em>/mntS</em> and
<em>/mntP</em> is the root directory, <em>/</em>, which is mounted as
private:</p>
<pre><code>sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | awk &#39;$1 == 61&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
61 0 8:2 / / rw,relatime</code></pre>
<p>On a second terminal, we create a new mount namespace where we run a
second shell and inspect the mounts:</p>
<pre><code>$ PS1=&#39;sh2# &#39; sudo unshare -m --propagation unchanged sh
sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
222 145 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
225 145 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime</code></pre>
<p>The new mount namespace received a copy of the initial mount
namespace's mounts. These new mounts maintain the same propagation
types, but have unique mount IDs. (The <em>--propagation unchanged</em>
option prevents <strong>unshare</strong>(1) from marking all mounts as
private when creating a new mount namespace, which it does by
default.)</p>
<p>In the second terminal, we then create submounts under each of
<em>/mntS</em> and <em>/mntP</em> and inspect the set-up:</p>
<pre><code>sh2# mkdir /mntS/a
sh2# mount /dev/sdb6 /mntS/a
sh2# mkdir /mntP/b
sh2# mount /dev/sdb7 /mntP/b
sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
222 145 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
225 145 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime
178 222 8:22 / /mntS/a rw,relatime shared:2
230 225 8:23 / /mntP/b rw,relatime</code></pre>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that <em>/mntS/a</em> was created as
shared (inheriting this setting from its parent mount) and
<em>/mntP/b</em> was created as a private mount.</p>
<p>Returning to the first terminal and inspecting the set-up, we see
that the new mount created under the shared mount <em>/mntS</em>
propagated to its peer mount (in the initial mount namespace), but the
new mount created under the private mount <em>/mntP</em> did not
propagate:</p>
<pre><code>sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
77 61 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
83 61 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime
179 77 8:22 / /mntS/a rw,relatime shared:2</code></pre>
<h2>MS_SLAVE example</h2>
<p>Making a mount a slave allows it to receive propagated
<strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>umount</strong>(2) events from a
master shared peer group, while preventing it from propagating events to
that master. This is useful if we want to (say) receive a mount event
when an optical disk is mounted in the master shared peer group (in
another mount namespace), but want to prevent <strong>mount</strong>(2)
and <strong>umount</strong>(2) events under the slave mount from having
side effects in other namespaces.</p>
<p>We can demonstrate the effect of slaving by first marking two mounts
as shared in the initial mount namespace:</p>
<pre><code>sh1# mount --make-shared /mntX
sh1# mount --make-shared /mntY
sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
132 83 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
133 83 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2</code></pre>
<p>On a second terminal, we create a new mount namespace and inspect the
mounts:</p>
<pre><code>sh2# unshare -m --propagation unchanged sh
sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2</code></pre>
<p>In the new mount namespace, we then mark one of the mounts as a
slave:</p>
<pre><code>sh2# mount --make-slave /mntY
sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime master:2</code></pre>
<p>From the above output, we see that <em>/mntY</em> is now a slave
mount that is receiving propagation events from the shared peer group
with the ID 2.</p>
<p>Continuing in the new namespace, we create submounts under each of
<em>/mntX</em> and <em>/mntY</em>:</p>
<pre><code>sh2# mkdir /mntX/a
sh2# mount /dev/sda3 /mntX/a
sh2# mkdir /mntY/b
sh2# mount /dev/sda5 /mntY/b</code></pre>
<p>When we inspect the state of the mounts in the new mount namespace,
we see that <em>/mntX/a</em> was created as a new shared mount
(inheriting the "shared" setting from its parent mount) and
<em>/mntY/b</em> was created as a private mount:</p>
<pre><code>sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime master:2
173 168 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3
175 169 8:5 / /mntY/b rw,relatime</code></pre>
<p>Returning to the first terminal (in the initial mount namespace), we
see that the mount <em>/mntX/a</em> propagated to the peer (the shared
<em>/mntX</em>), but the mount <em>/mntY/b</em> was not propagated:</p>
<pre><code>sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
132 83 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
133 83 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2
174 132 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a new mount under <em>/mntY</em> in the first
shell:</p>
<pre><code>sh1# mkdir /mntY/c
sh1# mount /dev/sda1 /mntY/c
sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
132 83 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
133 83 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2
174 132 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3
178 133 8:1 / /mntY/c rw,relatime shared:4</code></pre>
<p>When we examine the mounts in the second mount namespace, we see that
in this case the new mount has been propagated to the slave mount, and
that the new mount is itself a slave mount (to peer group 4):</p>
<pre><code>sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime master:2
173 168 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3
175 169 8:5 / /mntY/b rw,relatime
179 169 8:1 / /mntY/c rw,relatime master:4</code></pre>
<h2>MS_UNBINDABLE example</h2>
<p>One of the primary purposes of unbindable mounts is to avoid the
"mount explosion" problem when repeatedly performing bind mounts of a
higher-level subtree at a lower-level mount. The problem is illustrated
by the following shell session.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a system with the following mounts:</p>
<pre><code># mount | awk &#39;{print $1, $2, $3}&#39;
/dev/sda1 on /
/dev/sdb6 on /mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /mntY</code></pre>
<p>Suppose furthermore that we wish to recursively bind mount the root
directory under several users' home directories. We do this for the
first user, and inspect the mounts:</p>
<pre><code># mount --rbind / /home/cecilia/
# mount | awk &#39;{print $1, $2, $3}&#39;
/dev/sda1 on /
/dev/sdb6 on /mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY</code></pre>
<p>When we repeat this operation for the second user, we start to see
the explosion problem:</p>
<pre><code># mount --rbind / /home/henry
# mount | awk &#39;{print $1, $2, $3}&#39;
/dev/sda1 on /
/dev/sdb6 on /mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/henry
/dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/henry/home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntY</code></pre>
<p>Under <em>/home/henry</em>, we have not only recursively added the
<em>/mntX</em> and <em>/mntY</em> mounts, but also the recursive mounts
of those directories under <em>/home/cecilia</em> that were created in
the previous step. Upon repeating the step for a third user, it becomes
obvious that the explosion is exponential in nature:</p>
<pre><code># mount --rbind / /home/otto
# mount | awk &#39;{print $1, $2, $3}&#39;
/dev/sda1 on /
/dev/sdb6 on /mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/henry
/dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/henry/home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/otto
/dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/otto/home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/home/cecilia/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/otto/home/henry
/dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/home/henry/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/home/henry/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/otto/home/henry/home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/home/henry/home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/home/henry/home/cecilia/mntY</code></pre>
<p>The mount explosion problem in the above scenario can be avoided by
making each of the new mounts unbindable. The effect of doing this is
that recursive mounts of the root directory will not replicate the
unbindable mounts. We make such a mount for the first user:</p>
<pre><code># mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/cecilia</code></pre>
<p>Before going further, we show that unbindable mounts are indeed
unbindable:</p>
<pre><code># mkdir /mntZ
# mount --bind /home/cecilia /mntZ
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /home/cecilia,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error

       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail or so.</code></pre>
<p>Now we create unbindable recursive bind mounts for the other two
users:</p>
<pre><code># mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/henry
# mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/otto</code></pre>
<p>Upon examining the list of mounts, we see there has been no explosion
of mounts, because the unbindable mounts were not replicated under each
user's directory:</p>
<pre><code># mount | awk &#39;{print $1, $2, $3}&#39;
/dev/sda1 on /
/dev/sdb6 on /mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/henry
/dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/mntY
/dev/sda1 on /home/otto
/dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/mntY</code></pre>
<h2>Propagation type transitions</h2>
<p>The following table shows the effect that applying a new propagation
type (i.e., <em>mount --make-xxxx</em>) has on the existing propagation
type of a mount. The rows correspond to existing propagation types, and
the columns are the new propagation settings. For reasons of space,
"private" is abbreviated as "priv" and "unbindable" as "unbind".</p>

<h2>Mount semantics</h2>
<p>Suppose that we use the following command to create a mount:</p>
<pre><code>mount device B/b</code></pre>
<p>Here, <em>B</em> is the destination mount, and <em>b</em> is a
subdirectory path under the mount point <em>B</em>. The propagation type
of the resulting mount, <em>B/b</em>, follows the same rules as for a
bind mount, where the propagation type of the source mount is considered
always to be private.</p>
<h2>Unmount semantics</h2>
<p>Suppose that we use the following command to tear down a mount:</p>
<pre><code>umount A</code></pre>
<p>Here, <em>A</em> is a mount on <em>B/b</em>, where <em>B</em> is the
parent mount and <em>b</em> is a subdirectory path under the mount point
<em>B</em>. If <strong>B</strong> is shared, then all
most-recently-mounted mounts at <em>b</em> on mounts that receive
propagation from mount <em>B</em> and do not have submounts under them
are unmounted.</p>
<h2>The /proc/ pid /mountinfo propagate_from tag</h2>
<p>The <em>propagate_from:X</em> tag is shown in the optional fields of
a <em>/proc/</em>pid<em>/mountinfo</em> record in cases where a process
can't see a slave's immediate master (i.e., the pathname of the master
is not reachable from the filesystem root directory) and so cannot
determine the chain of propagation between the mounts it can see.</p>
<p>In the following example, we first create a two-link master-slave
chain between the mounts <em>/mnt</em>, <em>/tmp/etc</em>, and
<em>/mnt/tmp/etc</em>. Then the <strong>chroot</strong>(1) command is
used to make the <em>/tmp/etc</em> mount point unreachable from the root
directory, creating a situation where the master of
<em>/mnt/tmp/etc</em> is not reachable from the (new) root directory of
the process.</p>
<p>First, we bind mount the root directory onto <em>/mnt</em> and then
bind mount <em>/proc</em> at <em>/mnt/proc</em> so that after the later
<strong>chroot</strong>(1) the <strong>proc</strong>(5) filesystem
remains visible at the correct location in the chroot-ed
environment.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir -p /mnt/proc
# mount --bind / /mnt
# mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc</code></pre>
<p>Next, we ensure that the <em>/mnt</em> mount is a shared mount in a
new peer group (with no peers):</p>
<pre><code># mount --make-private /mnt  # Isolate from any previous peer group
# mount --make-shared /mnt
# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep &#39;/mnt&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5</code></pre>
<p>Next, we bind mount <em>/mnt/etc</em> onto <em>/tmp/etc</em>:</p>
<pre><code># mkdir -p /tmp/etc
# mount --bind /mnt/etc /tmp/etc
# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | egrep &#39;/mnt|/tmp/&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5
267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:102</code></pre>
<p>Initially, these two mounts are in the same peer group, but we then
make the <em>/tmp/etc</em> a slave of <em>/mnt/etc</em>, and then make
<em>/tmp/etc</em> shared as well, so that it can propagate events to the
next slave in the chain:</p>
<pre><code># mount --make-slave /tmp/etc
# mount --make-shared /tmp/etc
# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | egrep &#39;/mnt|/tmp/&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5
267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:105 master:102</code></pre>
<p>Then we bind mount <em>/tmp/etc</em> onto <em>/mnt/tmp/etc</em>.
Again, the two mounts are initially in the same peer group, but we then
make <em>/mnt/tmp/etc</em> a slave of <em>/tmp/etc</em>:</p>
<pre><code># mkdir -p /mnt/tmp/etc
# mount --bind /tmp/etc /mnt/tmp/etc
# mount --make-slave /mnt/tmp/etc
# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | egrep &#39;/mnt|/tmp/&#39; | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5
267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:105 master:102
273 239 8:2 /etc /mnt/tmp/etc ... master:105</code></pre>
<p>From the above, we see that <em>/mnt</em> is the master of the slave
<em>/tmp/etc</em>, which in turn is the master of the slave
<em>/mnt/tmp/etc</em>.</p>
<p>We then <strong>chroot</strong>(1) to the <em>/mnt</em> directory,
which renders the mount with ID 267 unreachable from the (new) root
directory:</p>
<pre><code># chroot /mnt</code></pre>
<p>When we examine the state of the mounts inside the chroot-ed
environment, we see the following:</p>
<pre><code># cat /proc/self/mountinfo | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
239 61 8:2 / / ... shared:102
248 239 0:4 / /proc ... shared:5
273 239 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... master:105 propagate_from:102</code></pre>
<p>Above, we see that the mount with ID 273 is a slave whose master is
the peer group 105. The mount point for that master is unreachable, and
so a <em>propagate_from</em> tag is displayed, indicating that the
closest dominant peer group (i.e., the nearest reachable mount in the
slave chain) is the peer group with the ID 102 (corresponding to the
<em>/mnt</em> mount point before the <strong>chroot</strong>(1) was
performed).</p>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>Mount namespaces first appeared in Linux 2.4.19.</p>
<h1>STANDARDS</h1>
<p>Namespaces are a Linux-specific feature.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The propagation type assigned to a new mount depends on the
propagation type of the parent mount. If the mount has a parent (i.e.,
it is a non-root mount point) and the propagation type of the parent is
<strong>MS_SHARED</strong>, then the propagation type of the new mount
is also <strong>MS_SHARED</strong>. Otherwise, the propagation type of
the new mount is <strong>MS_PRIVATE</strong>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the default propagation type for new
mount is in many cases <strong>MS_PRIVATE</strong>,
<strong>MS_SHARED</strong> is typically more useful. For this reason,
<strong>systemd</strong>(1) automatically remounts all mounts as
<strong>MS_SHARED</strong> on system startup. Thus, on most modern
systems, the default propagation type is in practice
<strong>MS_SHARED</strong>.</p>
<p>Since, when one uses <strong>unshare</strong>(1) to create a mount
namespace, the goal is commonly to provide full isolation of the mounts
in the new namespace, <strong>unshare</strong>(1) (since
<em>util-linux</em> 2.27) in turn reverses the step performed by
<strong>systemd</strong>(1), by making all mounts private in the new
namespace. That is, <strong>unshare</strong>(1) performs the equivalent
of the following in the new mount namespace:</p>
<pre><code>mount --make-rprivate /</code></pre>
<p>To prevent this, one can use the <em>--propagation unchanged</em>
option to <strong>unshare</strong>(1).</p>
<p>An application that creates a new mount namespace directly using
<strong>clone</strong>(2) or <strong>unshare</strong>(2) may desire to
prevent propagation of mount events to other mount namespaces (as is
done by <strong>unshare</strong>(1)). This can be done by changing the
propagation type of mounts in the new namespace to either
<strong>MS_SLAVE</strong> or <strong>MS_PRIVATE</strong>, using a call
such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>mount(NULL, &quot;/&quot;, MS_SLAVE | MS_REC, NULL);</code></pre>
<p>For a discussion of propagation types when moving mounts
(<strong>MS_MOVE</strong>) and creating bind mounts
(<strong>MS_BIND</strong>), see
<em>Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.rst</em>.</p>
<h2>Restrictions on mount namespaces</h2>
<p>Note the following points with respect to mount namespaces:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each mount namespace has an owner user namespace. As explained above,
when a new mount namespace is created, its mount list is initialized as
a copy of the mount list of another mount namespace. If the new
namespace and the namespace from which the mount list was copied are
owned by different user namespaces, then the new mount namespace is
considered <em>less privileged</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When creating a less privileged mount namespace, shared mounts are
reduced to slave mounts. This ensures that mappings performed in less
privileged mount namespaces will not propagate to more privileged mount
namespaces.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mounts that come as a single unit from a more privileged mount
namespace are locked together and may not be separated in a less
privileged mount namespace. (The <strong>unshare</strong>(2)
<strong>CLONE_NEWNS</strong> operation brings across all of the mounts
from the original mount namespace as a single unit, and recursive mounts
that propagate between mount namespaces propagate as a single unit.)</p>
<p>In this context, "may not be separated" means that the mounts are
locked so that they may not be individually unmounted. Consider the
following example:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh
# mount --bind /dev/null /etc/shadow
# cat /etc/shadow       # Produces no output</code></pre>
<p>The above steps, performed in a more privileged mount namespace, have
created a bind mount that obscures the contents of the shadow password
file, <em>/etc/shadow</em>. For security reasons, it should not be
possible to <strong>umount</strong>(2) that mount in a less privileged
mount namespace, since that would reveal the contents of
<em>/etc/shadow</em>.</p>
<p>Suppose we now create a new mount namespace owned by a new user
namespace. The new mount namespace will inherit copies of all of the
mounts from the previous mount namespace. However, those mounts will be
locked because the new mount namespace is less privileged. Consequently,
an attempt to <strong>umount</strong>(2) the mount fails as show in the
following step:</p>
<pre><code># unshare --user --map-root-user --mount \
               strace -o /tmp/log \
               umount /mnt/dir
umount: /etc/shadow: not mounted.
# grep &#39;^umount&#39; /tmp/log
umount2(&quot;/etc/shadow&quot;, 0)     = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)</code></pre>
<p>The error message from <strong>mount</strong>(8) is a little
confusing, but the <strong>strace</strong>(1) output reveals that the
underlying <strong>umount2</strong>(2) system call failed with the error
<strong>EINVAL</strong>, which is the error that the kernel returns to
indicate that the mount is locked.</p>
<p>Note, however, that it is possible to stack (and unstack) a mount on
top of one of the inherited locked mounts in a less privileged mount
namespace:</p>
<pre><code># echo &#39;aaaaa&#39; &gt; /tmp/a    # File to mount onto /etc/shadow
# unshare --user --map-root-user --mount \
    sh -c &#39;mount --bind /tmp/a /etc/shadow; cat /etc/shadow&#39;
aaaaa
# umount /etc/shadow</code></pre>
<p>The final <strong>umount</strong>(8) command above, which is
performed in the initial mount namespace, makes the original
<em>/etc/shadow</em> file once more visible in that namespace.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Following on from point [3], note that it is possible to
<strong>umount</strong>(2) an entire subtree of mounts that propagated
as a unit into a less privileged mount namespace, as illustrated in the
following example.</p>
<p>First, we create new user and mount namespaces using
<strong>unshare</strong>(1). In the new mount namespace, the propagation
type of all mounts is set to private. We then create a shared bind mount
at <em>/mnt</em>, and a small hierarchy of mounts underneath that
mount.</p>
<pre><code>$ PS1=&#39;ns1# &#39; sudo unshare --user --map-root-user \
                       --mount --propagation private bash
ns1# echo $$        # We need the PID of this shell later
778501
ns1# mount --make-shared --bind /mnt /mnt
ns1# mkdir /mnt/x
ns1# mount --make-private -t tmpfs none /mnt/x
ns1# mkdir /mnt/x/y
ns1# mount --make-private -t tmpfs none /mnt/x/y
ns1# grep /mnt /proc/self/mountinfo | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
986 83 8:5 /mnt /mnt rw,relatime shared:344
989 986 0:56 / /mnt/x rw,relatime
990 989 0:57 / /mnt/x/y rw,relatime</code></pre>
<p>Continuing in the same shell session, we then create a second shell
in a new user namespace and a new (less privileged) mount namespace and
check the state of the propagated mounts rooted at <em>/mnt</em>.</p>
<pre><code>ns1# PS1=&#39;ns2# &#39; unshare --user --map-root-user \
                       --mount --propagation unchanged bash
ns2# grep /mnt /proc/self/mountinfo | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
1239 1204 8:5 /mnt /mnt rw,relatime master:344
1240 1239 0:56 / /mnt/x rw,relatime
1241 1240 0:57 / /mnt/x/y rw,relatime</code></pre>
<p>Of note in the above output is that the propagation type of the mount
<em>/mnt</em> has been reduced to slave, as explained in point [2]. This
means that submount events will propagate from the master <em>/mnt</em>
in "ns1", but propagation will not occur in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>From a separate terminal window, we then use
<strong>nsenter</strong>(1) to enter the mount and user namespaces
corresponding to "ns1". In that terminal window, we then recursively
bind mount <em>/mnt/x</em> at the location <em>/mnt/ppp</em>.</p>
<pre><code>$ PS1=&#39;ns3# &#39; sudo nsenter -t 778501 --user --mount
ns3# mount --rbind --make-private /mnt/x /mnt/ppp
ns3# grep /mnt /proc/self/mountinfo | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
986 83 8:5 /mnt /mnt rw,relatime shared:344
989 986 0:56 / /mnt/x rw,relatime
990 989 0:57 / /mnt/x/y rw,relatime
1242 986 0:56 / /mnt/ppp rw,relatime
1243 1242 0:57 / /mnt/ppp/y rw,relatime shared:518</code></pre>
<p>Because the propagation type of the parent mount, <em>/mnt</em>, was
shared, the recursive bind mount propagated a small subtree of mounts
under the slave mount <em>/mnt</em> into "ns2", as can be verified by
executing the following command in that shell session:</p>
<pre><code>ns2# grep /mnt /proc/self/mountinfo | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;
1239 1204 8:5 /mnt /mnt rw,relatime master:344
1240 1239 0:56 / /mnt/x rw,relatime
1241 1240 0:57 / /mnt/x/y rw,relatime
1244 1239 0:56 / /mnt/ppp rw,relatime
1245 1244 0:57 / /mnt/ppp/y rw,relatime master:518</code></pre>
<p>While it is not possible to <strong>umount</strong>(2) a part of the
propagated subtree (<em>/mnt/ppp/y</em>) in "ns2", it is possible to
<strong>umount</strong>(2) the entire subtree, as shown by the following
commands:</p>
<pre><code>ns2# umount /mnt/ppp/y
umount: /mnt/ppp/y: not mounted.
ns2# umount -l /mnt/ppp | sed &#39;s/ - .*//&#39;      # Succeeds...
ns2# grep /mnt /proc/self/mountinfo
1239 1204 8:5 /mnt /mnt rw,relatime master:344
1240 1239 0:56 / /mnt/x rw,relatime
1241 1240 0:57 / /mnt/x/y rw,relatime</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>mount</strong>(2) flags <strong>MS_RDONLY</strong>,
<strong>MS_NOSUID</strong>, <strong>MS_NOEXEC</strong>, and the "atime"
flags (<strong>MS_NOATIME</strong>, <strong>MS_NODIRATIME</strong>,
<strong>MS_RELATIME</strong>) settings become locked when propagated
from a more privileged to a less privileged mount namespace, and may not
be changed in the less privileged mount namespace.</p>
<p>This point is illustrated in the following example where, in a more
privileged mount namespace, we create a bind mount that is marked as
read-only. For security reasons, it should not be possible to make the
mount writable in a less privileged mount namespace, and indeed the
kernel prevents this:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /mnt/dir
$ sudo mount --bind -o ro /some/path /mnt/dir
$ sudo unshare --user --map-root-user --mount \
               mount -o remount,rw /mnt/dir
mount: /mnt/dir: permission denied.</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A file or directory that is a mount point in one namespace that is
not a mount point in another namespace, may be renamed, unlinked, or
removed (<strong>rmdir</strong>(2)) in the mount namespace in which it
is not a mount point (subject to the usual permission checks).
Consequently, the mount point is removed in the mount namespace where it
was a mount point.</p>
<p>Previously (before Linux 3.18), attempting to unlink, rename, or
remove a file or directory that was a mount point in another mount
namespace would result in the error <strong>EBUSY</strong>. That
behavior had technical problems of enforcement (e.g., for NFS) and
permitted denial-of-service attacks against more privileged users (i.e.,
preventing individual files from being updated by bind mounting on top
of them).</p>
