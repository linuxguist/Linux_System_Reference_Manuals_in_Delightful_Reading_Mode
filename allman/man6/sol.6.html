<h1>USAGE</h1>
<p>This text is taken verbatim from the AisleRiot Manual V2.12.</p>
<p>Moving the cards is reasonably obvious. Assuming you have a
right-handed mouse, left-click on a card and drag it somewhere. Release
the mouse button to deposit the card. If a card can be moved to the
foundation(s), you do not need to drag it. You can double-click on it
and it will move. If a sequence of cards can be moved to the
foundations, you can generally move the sequence as one move.</p>
<p>Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation, if that is
possible. This is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at the
end of a successful game.</p>
<p>In games which have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on the
empty space where it was. Be warned that some games only let you do this
a limited number of time. Watch for the Redeals Left message at the
bottom of the window. A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a
face-up card which is partially obscured by a card laid over it will
raise it so that you can see what it is. There is an alternative way to
move cards. By selecting <strong>Click to move</strong> from the
<strong>Control</strong> menu you can click once to pick up a card and
then click again to place it. This can be faster than dragging and will
be easier on your hand since you don't have to hold the mouse down.
However, it may take a while to get used to. Some games have options to
change the way the game is played. For example Klondike can be played
with either single card deals or three-card deals. In these games there
is a separate menu with the game's name. You can only change the rules
of the game at the beginning of the game -- the menu will be inactive
during the game.</p>
<p>Statistics on how well you have done at a particular game are
available by selecting <strong>Statistics</strong> from the Game menu.
Only games where you actually start moving cards are counted. The
statistics are here for your own enjoyment, there are numerous ways to
cheat and it is unwise to make comparisons.</p>
