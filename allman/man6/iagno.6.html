<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>GNOME Reversi - A disk flipping strategy board game</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>iagno</strong> [<em>OPTION...</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Reversi is a two-player strategy game, played on an 8 by 8 board.
Players use tiles that are dark on one side and light on the other.</p>
<p>The object of reversi is to flip your opponent’s tiles to your color,
while your opponent is trying to flip your tiles to his own color.
Opponent’s tiles are flipped when trapped between an already placed tile
of your color and the tile you add. Who finishes with more tiles
wins!</p>
<p>GNOME Reversi allows you to play both a classic reversi game, and the
reversed variant, where the goal is to finish with less tile than your
opponent.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>--alternative-start</strong><br />
<strong>--random-start</strong><br />
<strong>--usual-start</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reversi can be played with two different initial positions.<br />
The options --usual-start and --alternative-start permit to directly
choose which initial position will be used.<br />
The option --random-start is for choosing one randomly.<br />
The three options disable setting the mode from the window.<br />
You should only use one of these options at the same time.</p>

<strong>--reverse</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>GNOME Reversi includes two games played with the same

You should only use one of these options at the same time.</p>
