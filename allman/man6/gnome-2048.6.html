<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>GNOME 2048 - Obtain the highest possible tile</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>gnome-2048</strong> [<em>OPTION...</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>2048 is a highly addictive single-player game. Gameplay consists of
joining numbers in a grid for obtaining bigger values.</p>
<p>Use your keyboard’s arrow keys or gestures to slide all tiles in the
desired direction. Be careful: all tiles slide to their farthest
possible positions, you cannot slide just one tile or one row or column.
Tiles with the same value are joined when slided one over the other.
After your turn, one new tile is added to the game.</p>
<p>Gnome 2048 only adds tiles of value 2, as opposed to the original
2048 game. Also, it allows you to play on grids of various size.</p>
