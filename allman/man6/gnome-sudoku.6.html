<p><strong>gnome-sudoku</strong> a simple player for the sudoku number

rates their difficulty. Games can be played or printed, so GNOME Sudoku
can be used to print out a set of puzzles to take with you or to play a
puzzle at a time on screen. All games persist across sessions and you
can resume any old game at any time, as well as replay any game you've
already won. More information about GNOME Sudoku can be found at
