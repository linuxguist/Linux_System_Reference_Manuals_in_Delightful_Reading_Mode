<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>regulatory.bin, regulatory.db - The Linux wireless regulatory
database</p>
<h2></h2>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p><strong>regulatory.bin</strong> and <strong>regulatory.db</strong>
are the files used by the Linux wireless subsystem to keep its
regulatory database information.</p>
<p><strong>regulatory.bin</strong> is read by <strong>crda</strong> upon
the Linux kernel's request for regulatory information for a specific ISO
/ IEC 3166 alpha2 country code.</p>
<p><strong>regulatory.db</strong> is a newer, extensible database format
which (since Linux 4.15) is read by the kernel directly as a firmware
file.</p>
<p>The regulatory database is kept in a small binary format for size and
code efficiency. The <strong>regulatory.bin</strong> file can be parsed
and read in human format by using the <strong>regdbdump</strong>
command. The regulatory database files should be updated upon regulatory
changes or corrections.</p>
<h1>Upkeeping</h1>
<p>The regulatory database is maintained by the community as such you
are encouraged to send any corrections or updates to the linux-wireless
and wireless-regdb mailing lists:
<strong>linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org</strong> and
<strong>wireless-regdb@lists.infradead.org</strong></p>
