<h1>NAME</h1>
<p><strong>sane-airscan</strong> - SANE backend for AirScan (eSCL) and
WSD scanners and MFP</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-airscan</strong> is the universal backend for
"driverless" document scanning. Currently it supports two protocols:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
1. eSCL, also known as AirScan or AirPrint scan
2. WSD, also known as WS-Scan</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The sane-airscan loads its configuration files from the following
places:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
1. /etc/sane.d/airscan.conf
2. /etc/sane.d/airscan.d/*</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The configuration file syntax is very similar to the .INI file
syntax. It consist of sections, each section contains some variables.
Comments are started from # or ; characters and continies until end of
line</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
# This is a comment
[section 1]
variable 1 = value 1  ; and another comment
variable 2 = value 2</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Leading and trailing spaces of variable name and value are striped.
If you want to preserve them, put name or value into quotes ("like
this").</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION OF DEVICES</h1>
<p>If scanner and computer are connected to the same LAN segment,
everything expected to "just work" out of box, without any need of
manual configuration.</p>
<p>However, in some cases manual configuration can be useful. For
example:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
1. If computer and scanner are connected via IP router
2. There are a lot of devices on a corporate network, but
   only few of them are interesting
3. Automatic discovery works unreliable</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>To manually configure a device, add the following section to the
configuration file:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
[devices]
&quot;Kyocera eSCL&quot; = http://192.168.1.102:9095/eSCL, eSCL
&quot;Kyocera WSD&quot; = http://192.168.1.102:5358/WSDScanner, WSD
&quot;Device I do not want to see&quot; = disable</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>[devices]</strong> section contains all manually
configured devices, one line per device, and each line contains a device
name on a left side of equation and device URL on a rights side,
followed by protocol (eSCL or WSD). If protocol is omitted, eSCL is
assumed. You may also disable particular device by using the
<strong>disable</strong> keyword instead of URL.</p>
<p>In addition, you can manually configure a device by directly passing
its URL in a device name without adding it to the configuration file.
This takes the format <strong>protocol:Device Name:URL</strong>. The
examples above could be written as <strong>escl:Kyocera
eSCL:http://192.168.1.102:9095/eSCL</strong> and <strong>wsd:Kyocera
WSD:http://192.168.1.102:5358/WSDScanner</strong>.</p>
<p>To figure out URLs of available devices, the simplest way is to run a
supplied <strong>airscan-discover</strong> tool on a computer connected
with scanner to the same LAN segment. On success, this program will dump
to its standard output a list of discovered devices in a format suitable
for inclusion into the configuration file.</p>
<p>If running <strong>airscan-discover</strong> on same LAN segment as a
scanner is not possible, you will have to follow a hard way. Your
administrator must know device IP address, consult your device manual
for the eSCL port, and the URL path component most likely is the
"/eSCL", though on some devices it may differ. Discovering WSD URLs
doing this way is much harder, because it is very difficult to guess TCP
port and URL path, that in a case of eSCL.</p>
<p>For eSCL devices, the URL can also use the unix:// scheme, such as
unix://scanner.sock/eSCL. The "host" from the URL is a file name that
will be searched for in the directory specified by socket_dir (see
below). When connecting to the scanner, all traffic will be sent to the
specified UNIX socket instead of a TCP connection.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Miscellaneous options all goes to the <strong>[options]</strong>
section. Currently the following options are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
[options]
; If there are a lot of scanners around and you are only
; interested in few of them, disable auto discovery and
; configure scanners manually
discovery = enable | disable

; Choose what SANE apps will show in a list of devices:
; scanner network name (the default) or hardware model name
model = network | hardware

; If device supports both eSCL and WSD protocol, sane-airscan
; may either choose the &quot;best&quot; protocol automatically, or
; expose all variants for user, allowing manual protocol selection.
; The default is &quot;auto&quot;
protocol = auto | manual

; Discovery of WSD devices may be &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;full&quot;. The &quot;fast&quot;
; mode works as fast as DNS-SD discovery, but in some cases
; may be unreliable. The &quot;full&quot; mode is slow and reliable.
; This is also possible to disable automatic discovery
; of WSD devices. The default is &quot;fast&quot;.
ws-discovery = fast | full | off

; Scanners that use the unix:// schema in their URL can only specify a
; socket name (not a full path).  The name will be searched for in the
; directory specified here. The default is /var/run.
socket_dir = /path/to/directory</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BLACKLISTING DEVICES</h1>
<p>This feature can be useful, if you are on a very big network and have
a lot of devices around you, while interesting only in a few of
them.</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
[blacklist]
model = &quot;Xerox*&quot;       ; blacklist by model name
name  = &quot;HP*&quot;          ; blacklist by network name
ip    = 192.168.0.1    ; blacklist by address
ip    = 192.168.0.0/24 ; blacklist the whole subnet</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Network names come from DNS-SD, WS-Discovery doesn't provide this
information. For filtering by network name to work, Avahi must be
enabled and device must be discoverable via DNS-SD (not necessarily as a
scanner, it's enough if WSD scanner is discoverable as a printer via
DNS-SD).</p>
<p>Blacklisting only affects automatic discovery, and doesn't affect
manually configured devices</p>
<h1>DEBUGGING</h1>
<p>sane-airscan provides very good instrumentation for troubleshooting
without physical access to the problemmatic device.</p>
<p>Debugging facilities can be controlled using the
<strong>[debug]</strong> section of the configuration file:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>
[debug]
; Enable or disable console logging
enable = false | true

; Enable protocol trace and configure output directory
; for trace files. Like in shell, to specify path relative to
; the home directory, start it with tilda character, followed
; by slash, i.e., &quot;~/airscan/trace&quot;. The directory will
; be created automatically.
trace = path

; Hex dump all traffic to the trace file (very verbose!)
hexdump = false | true</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>/etc/sane.d/airscan.conf</strong>,
<strong>/etc/sane.d/airscan.d/*</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The backend configuration files</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>/usr/LIBDIR/sane/libsane-airscan.so</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_AIRSCAN</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable if set to <strong>true</strong> or non-zero numerical
value, enables debug messages, that are printed to stdout</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable alters the search path for configuration files. This is
a colon-separated list of directories. These directories are searched
for the airscan.conf configuration file and for the airscan.d
subdirectory, before the standard path (/etc/sane.d) is searched.</p>
</dd>
