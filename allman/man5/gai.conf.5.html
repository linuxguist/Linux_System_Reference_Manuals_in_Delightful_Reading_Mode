<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>gai.conf - getaddrinfo(3) configuration file</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A call to <strong>getaddrinfo</strong>(3) might return multiple
answers. According to RFC 3484 these answers must be sorted so that the
answer with the highest success rate is first in the list. The RFC
provides an algorithm for the sorting. The static rules are not always
adequate, though. For this reason, the RFC also requires that system
administrators should have the possibility to dynamically change the
sorting. For the glibc implementation, this can be achieved with the
<em>/etc/gai.conf</em> file.</p>
<p>Each line in the configuration file consists of a keyword and its
parameters. White spaces in any place are ignored. Lines starting with
'#' are comments and are ignored.</p>
<p>The keywords currently recognized are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>label</strong> <em>netmask</em> <em>precedence</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The value is added to the label table used in the RFC 3484 sorting.
If any <strong>label</strong> definition is present in the configuration
file, the default table is not used. All the label definitions of the
default table which are to be maintained have to be duplicated.
Following the keyword, the line has to contain a network mask and a
precedence value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>precedence</strong> <em>netmask</em>
<em>precedence</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This keyword is similar to <strong>label</strong>, but instead the
value is added to the precedence table as specified in RFC 3484. Once
again, the presence of a single <strong>precedence</strong> line in the
configuration file causes the default table to not be used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>reload</strong>
&lt;<strong>yes</strong>|<strong>no</strong>&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This keyword controls whether a process checks whether the
configuration file has been changed since the last time it was read. If
the value is "<strong>yes</strong>", the file is reread. This might
cause problems in multithreaded applications and is generally a bad
idea. The default is "<strong>no</strong>".</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>scopev4</strong> <em>mask</em> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add another rule to the RFC 3484 scope table for IPv4 address. By
default, the scope IDs described in section 3.2 in RFC 3438 are used.
Changing these defaults should hardly ever be necessary.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p><em>/etc/gai.conf</em></p>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>The <em>gai.conf</em> file is supported since glibc 2.5.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The default table according to RFC 3484 would be specified with the
following configuration file:</p>
<pre><code>label  ::1/128       0
label  ::/0          1
label  2002::/16     2
label ::/96          3
label ::ffff:0:0/96  4
precedence  ::1/128       50
precedence  ::/0          40
precedence  2002::/16     30
precedence ::/96          20
precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10</code></pre>
