<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pkcs11.conf - Configuration files for PKCS#11 modules</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>pkcs11.conf</strong> configuration files are a standard
way to configure PKCS#11 modules.</p>
<h1>FILE FORMAT</h1>
<p>A complete configuration consists of several files. These files are
text files. Since p11-kit is built to be used in all sorts of
environments and at very low levels of the software stack, we cannot
make use of high level configuration APIs that you may find on a modern
desktop.</p>
<p>Each setting in the config file is specified consists of a name and a
value. The name is a simple string consisting of characters and dashes.
The name consists of alpha numeric characters, dot, hyphen and
underscore.</p>
<p>The value is specified after the name on the same line, separated
from it by a : (colon). White space between the name and value is
ignored.</p>
<p>Blank lines are ignored. White space at the beginning or end of lines
is stripped. Lines that begin with a # character are ignored as
comments. Comments are not recognized when they come after a value on a
line.</p>
<p>A fictitious module configuration file might look like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>module: module.so
# Here is a comment

managed: true
setting.2: A long value with text.
x-custom : text</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>MODULE CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>Each configured PKCS#11 module has its own config file. These files
can be placed in various locations.</p>
<p>The filename of the configuration file may consist of upper and
lowercase letters underscore, comma, dash and dots. The first characters
needs to be an alphanumeric, the filename should end with a .module
extension.</p>
<p>Most importantly each config file specifies the path of the PKCS#11
module to load. A module config file has the following fields:</p>
<p><strong>module:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The filename of the PKCS#11 module to load. This should include an
extension like .so</p>
<p>If this value is blank, then the module will be ignored. This can be
used in the user configs to override loading of a module specified in
the system configuration.</p>
<p>If this is a relative path, then the module will be loaded from the
default module directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>critical:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set to yes if the module is critical and required to load. If a
critical module fails to load or initialize, then the loading process
for all registered modules will abort and return an error code.</p>
<p>This argument is optional and defaults to no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>enable-in:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma and/or space separated list of names of programs that this
module should only be loaded in. The module will not be loaded for other
programs using p11-kit. The base name of the process executable should
be used here, for example seahorse, ssh.</p>
<p>This option can also be used to control whether the module will be
loaded by the proxy module. To enable loading only from the proxy
module, specify p11-kit-proxy as the value.</p>
<p>This is not a security feature. The argument is optional. If not
present, then any process will load the module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>disable-in:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma and/or space separated list of names of programs that this
module should not be loaded in. The module will be loaded for any other
programs using p11-kit. The base name of the process executable should
be used here, for example firefox, thunderbird-bin.</p>
<p>This option can also be used to control whether the module will be
loaded by the proxy module. To disable loading from the proxy module,
specify p11-kit-proxy as the value.</p>
<p>This is not a security feature. The argument is optional. If not
present, then any process will load the module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>managed:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set to no if the module is not to be managed by p11-kit. Making a
module unmanaged is not recommended, and will cause problems if multiple
callers in a single process share a PKCS#11 module.</p>
<p>This argument is optional and defaults to yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>priority:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value should be an integer. When lists of modules are returned to
a caller of p11-kit, modules with a higher number are sorted first. When
applications search modules for certificates, keys and trust policy
information, this setting will affect what find first.</p>
<p>This argument is optional, and defaults to zero. Modules with the
same <strong>priority</strong> option will be sorted alphabetically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>remote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of loading the PKCS#11 module locally, run the module
remotely.</p>
<p>Specify a command to run, prefixed with | a pipe. The command must
speak the p11-kit remoting protocol on its standard in and standard out.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>remote: |ssh user@remote p11-kit remote /path/to/module.so</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Other forms of remoting will appear in later p11-kit releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>trust-policy:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set to yes to use use this module as a source of trust policy
information such as certificate anchors and blocklists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>log-calls:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set to yes to write a log to stderr of all the calls into the module.
This is only supported for managed modules.</p>
<p>This argument is optional and defaults to no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do not specify both enable-in and disable-in for the same module.</p>
<p>Other fields may be present, but it is recommended that field names
that are not specified in this document start with a x- prefix.</p>
<h1>GLOBAL CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>A global configuration may also be present. This file contains
settings that are not related to a single PKCS#11 module. The
location(s) of the global configuration are described below. The global
configuration file can contain the following fields:</p>
<p><strong>user-config:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will be equal to one of the following values: none, merge,
only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>managed:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set to yes or no to force all modules to be managed or unmanaged by
p11-kit. Setting this setting in a global configuration file will
override the managed setting in the individual module configuration
files. Making modules unmanaged is not recommended, and will cause
problems if multiple callers in a single process share a PKCS#11
module.</p>
<p>This argument is optional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>log-calls:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set to yes to write a log to stderr of all the calls into all
configured modules. This is only supported for managed modules.</p>
<p>This argument is optional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other fields may be present, but it is recommended that field names
that are not specified in this document start with a x- prefix.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILES</h1>
<p>Each configured PKCS#11 module has its own config file. These files
are placed in a directory. In addition a global config file exists.
There is a system configuration consisting of the various module config
files and a file for global configuration. Optionally each user can
provide additional configuration or override the system
configuration.</p>
<p>The system global configuration file is usually in
/etc/pkcs11/pkcs11.conf and the user global configuration file is in
~/.config/pkcs11/pkcs11.conf in the users home directory.</p>
<p>The module config files are usually located in the
/etc/pkcs11/modules directory, with one configuration file per module.
In addition the ~/.config/pkcs11/modules directory can be used for
modules installed by the user.</p>
<p>Note that user configuration files are not loaded from the home
directory if running inside a setuid or setgid program.</p>
<p>The default system config file and module directory can be changed
when building p11-kit. Always lookup these paths using pkg-config.</p>
