<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>libao.conf - configuration for libao.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>/etc/libao.conf</strong></p>
<p><strong>~/.libao</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>libao.conf</strong> and <strong>.libao</strong> are
configuration files for libao, the audio output library. They specify
various options to libao, as described below.
<strong>libao.conf</strong> sets system-wide options, whereas
<strong>~/.libao</strong> sets user-specific options. When an option is
set in both places, the option in <strong>~/.libao</strong> takes
precedence.</p>
<h1>FILE FORMAT</h1>
<p>The file consists of comments and key-value pairs. Comments are on
separate lines that start with a <strong>#</strong> symbol. The
key-value pairs are of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>key=value</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <strong>key</strong> contains no whitespace and no equal signs.
<strong>value</strong> will be all of the text after the equal sign
until (but not including) the ending newline. Beware of extra spaces at
the end of the line! They will probably be interpreted as part of the
option value.</p>
<p>The following is a list of valid global option keys. Any driver
specific option may be used as well as those keys.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>default_driver</dt>
<dd>
<p>The short name of the driver libao should use by default. Valid
values include (not all are available on every platform): pulse, oss,
esd, arts, alsa, nas, irix, sun, and sndio. Note that "sun" is used on
many BSD systems as well as Solaris.</p>
</dd>
<dt>debug (Value optional/ignored)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets all the drivers as well as AO itself into debugging output mode.
Unlike passing the debug option to a driver, debug will also print
debugging information from driver loading and testing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>quiet (Value optional/ignored)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets all the drivers as well as AO itself into silent mode. Errors
will return only error codes; neither ao nor the drivers will print any
output whatsoever to stderr.</p>
</dd>
<dt>verbose (Value optional/ignored)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets all the drivers as well as AO itself into verbose mode.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Here is an example <strong>libao.conf</strong> that forces the OSS
driver to be used by default:</p>
<p># This is a comment. default_driver=oss</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p><strong>libao.conf</strong> is missing a number of potentially useful
options.</p>
