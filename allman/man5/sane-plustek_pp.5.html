<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-plustek_pp - SANE backend for Plustek parallel port flatbed
scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-plustek_pp</strong> library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Plustek ASIC
9600[1/3] and P9800[1/3] based parallel port flatbed scanners.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED DEVICES</h1>
<p>At present, the following scanners should work with this backend:</p>

<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>This backend's default device is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>0x378</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This "default device" will be used if no configuration file can be
found. It is the base address of the parallel port on i386 machines.</p>
<p>As the backend supports up to four devices, it is possible to specify
them in the configuration file</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>/etc/sane.d/plustek_pp.conf</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>See this file for examples.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>This section describes the backend's configuration file entries. The
file is located at: <em>/etc/sane.d/plustek_pp.conf</em></p>
<p>For a proper setup, you will need at least two entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[direct]</em><br />
<em>device 0x378</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>direct</em> tells the backend, that the following devicename
(here <em>0x378</em>) has to be interpreted as parallel port scanner
device. In fact it is the address to use. Alternatively you can use
<em>/dev/parport0</em> if the backend has been compiled with libieee1284
support.</p>
<p>Further options:</p>
<p>option warmup t</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>t</em> specifies the warmup period in seconds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>option lampOff t</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>t</em> is the time in seconds for switching off the lamps in
standby mode</p>
</blockquote>
<p>option lOffonEnd b</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>b</em> specifies the behaviour when closing the backend, 1 --&gt;
switch lamps off, 0 --&gt; do not change lamp status</p>
</blockquote>
<p>option mov m</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>m</em> is the model override switch, which only works in direct
mode.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>m</em> = 0</dt>
<dd>
<p>default: no override</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>m</em> = 1</dt>
<dd>
<p>OpticPro 9630PL override (works if OP9630 has been detected) forces
legal size (14")</p>
</dd>

<p>Primax 4800Direct override (works if OP600 has been detected) swaps
red/green color</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>m</em> = 3</dt>

backends transparency/negative capabilities</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>m</em> = 4</dt>

backends transparency/negative capabilities</p>

scanning</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>m</em> = 6</dt>
<dd>
<p>OpticPro 4800P override (works if OP600 has been detected) swaps
red/green color</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>m</em> = 7</dt>
<dd>
<p>Primax 4800Direct 30bit override (works if OP4830 has been
detected)</p>
</dd>

<h1>PARALLEL PORT MODES</h1>
<p>The current driver works best, when the parallel port has been set to
EPP-mode. When detecting any other mode such as ECP or PS/2 the driver
tries to set to a faster, supported mode. If this fails, it will use the
SPP mode, as this mode should work with all Linux supported parallel
ports. If in doubt, enter your BIOS and set it to any mode except
ECP.</p>
<p>Former Plustek scanner models (4830, 9630) supplied a ISA parallel
port adapter card. This card is <strong>not</strong> supported by the
driver.</p>
<p>The ASIC 96001/3 based models have sometimes trouble with high
resolution modes. If you encounter sporadic corrupted images (parts
duplicated or shifted horizontally) kill all other applications before
scanning and (if sufficient memory available) disable swapping.</p>
<p>See the <em>plustek_pp.conf</em> file for examples.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/plustek_pp.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The backend configuration file</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-plustek_pp.a</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-plustek_pp.so</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in <em>/etc/sane.d</em>. If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories <em>tmp/config</em>,
<em>.</em>, and <em>/etc/sane.d</em> being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. Higher
debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>
<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP=10</p>
</dd>

<h1>CONTACT AND BUG-REPORTS</h1>
<p>Please send any information and bug-reports to:<br />
<strong>SANE Mailing List</strong></p>
<p>Additional info and hints can be obtained from our<br />
Mailing-List archive at:<br />
<em>http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</em></p>
<p>To obtain debug messages from the backend, please set the
environment-variable <strong>SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP</strong> before
calling your favorite scan-frontend (i.e.
<strong>xscanimage</strong>(1)),<strong>i.e.:</strong><br />
<em>export SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP=20 ; xscanimage</em></p>
<p>The value controls the verbosity of the backend.</p>
<h1>KNOWN BUGS &amp; RESTRICTIONS</h1>
<p>* The Halftoning works, but the quality is poor</p>
<p>* Printers (especially HP models) will start to print during
scanning. This in fact is a problem to other printers too, using
bidirectional protocol (see www.plustek.com (TAIWAN) page for further
details)</p>
<p>* The driver does not support these manic scalings up to 16 times the
physical resolution. The only scaling is done on resolutions between the
physical resolution of the CCD-sensor and the stepper motor i.e. you
have a 600x1200 dpi scanner and you are scanning using 800dpi, so
scaling is necessary, because the sensor only delivers 600dpi but the
motor is capable to perform 800dpi steps.</p>
<p>* On some devices, the pictures seems bluish</p>
<p><em>ASIC 98001 based models:</em></p>
<p>* The 300dpi transparency and negative mode does not work
correctly.</p>
<p>* There is currently no way to distinguish a model with and without
transparency unit.</p>
<p>* The scanned images seem to be too dark (P9636T)</p>
<p><em>ASIC 96003/1 based models:</em></p>
<p>* 30bit mode is currently not supported.</p>
<p>* On low end systems under heavy system load the driver may lose
data, which can result in picture corruption or cause the sensor to hit
the scan bed.</p>
<p>* The scanning speed on 600x1200 dpi models is slow.</p>
<p>* The scanning quality of the A3I is poor.</p>
