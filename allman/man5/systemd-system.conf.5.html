<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-system.conf, system.conf.d, systemd-user.conf, user.conf.d -
System and session service manager configuration files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/systemd/system.conf, /etc/systemd/system.conf.d/*.conf,
/run/systemd/system.conf.d/*.conf, /lib/systemd/system.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<p>~/.config/systemd/user.conf, /etc/systemd/user.conf,
/etc/systemd/user.conf.d/*.conf, /run/systemd/user.conf.d/*.conf,
/usr/lib/systemd/user.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>When run as a system instance, <strong>systemd</strong> interprets
the configuration file system.conf and the files in system.conf.d
directories; when run as a user instance, it interprets the
configuration file user.conf (either in the home directory of the user,
or if not found, under /etc/systemd/) and the files in user.conf.d
directories. These configuration files contain a few settings
controlling basic manager operations.</p>
<p>See <strong>systemd.syntax</strong>(7) for a general description of
the syntax.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1>
<p>The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration
is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults.
Initially, the main configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains
commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by
creating drop-ins, as described below. Using drop-ins for local
configuration is recommended over modifications to the main
configuration file.</p>
<p>In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration
snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those
drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration
file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option,
for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file
sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.</p>
<p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install
drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local
administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration
files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override
package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower
precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the
ordering of the files.</p>
<p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
file.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>All options are configured in the [Manager] section:</p>
<p><em>LogColor=</em>, <em>LogLevel=</em>, <em>LogLocation=</em>,
<em>LogTarget=</em>, <em>LogTime=</em>, <em>DumpCore=yes</em>,
<em>CrashChangeVT=no</em>, <em>CrashShell=no</em>,
<em>CrashReboot=no</em>, <em>ShowStatus=yes</em>,
<em>DefaultStandardOutput=journal</em>,
<em>DefaultStandardError=inherit</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures various parameters of basic manager operation. These
options may be overridden by the respective process and kernel command
line arguments. See <strong>systemd</strong>(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CtrlAltDelBurstAction=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines what action will be performed if user presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete
more than 7 times in 2s. Can be set to "reboot-force", "poweroff-force",
"reboot-immediate", "poweroff-immediate" or disabled with "none".
Defaults to "reboot-force".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CPUAffinity=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the CPU affinity for the service manager as well as the
default CPU affinity for all forked off processes. Takes a list of CPU
indices or ranges separated by either whitespace or commas. CPU ranges
are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a dash.
This option may be specified more than once, in which case the specified
CPU affinity masks are merged. If the empty string is assigned, the mask
is reset, all assignments prior to this will have no effect. Individual
services may override the CPU affinity for their processes with the
<em>CPUAffinity=</em> setting in unit files, see
<strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NUMAPolicy=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the NUMA memory policy for the service manager and the
default NUMA memory policy for all forked off processes. Individual
services may override the default policy with the <em>NUMAPolicy=</em>
setting in unit files, see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NUMAMask=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the NUMA node mask that will be associated with the
selected NUMA policy. Note that <strong>default</strong> and
<strong>local</strong> NUMA policies dont require explicit NUMA node
mask and value of the option can be empty. Similarly to
<em>NUMAPolicy=</em>, value can be overridden by individual services in
unit files, see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em>, <em>RebootWatchdogSec=</em>,
<em>KExecWatchdogSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the hardware watchdog at runtime and at reboot. Takes a
timeout value in seconds (or in other time units if suffixed with "ms",
"min", "h", "d", "w"), or the special strings "off" or "default". If set
to "off" (alternatively: "0") the watchdog logic is disabled: no
watchdog device is opened, configured, or pinged. If set to the special
string "default" the watchdog is opened and pinged in regular intervals,
but the timeout is not changed from the default. If set to any other
time value the watchdog timeout is configured to the specified value (or
a value close to it, depending on hardware capabilities).</p>
<p>If <em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em> is set to a non-zero value, the
watchdog hardware (/dev/watchdog0 or the path specified with
<em>WatchdogDevice=</em> or the kernel option
<em>systemd.watchdog-device=</em>) will be programmed to automatically
reboot the system if it is not contacted within the specified timeout
interval. The system manager will ensure to contact it at least once in
half the specified timeout interval. This feature requires a hardware
watchdog device to be present, as it is commonly the case in embedded
and server systems. Not all hardware watchdogs allow configuration of
all possible reboot timeout values, in which case the closest available
timeout is picked.</p>
<p><em>RebootWatchdogSec=</em> may be used to configure the hardware
watchdog when the system is asked to reboot. It works as a safety net to
ensure that the reboot takes place even if a clean reboot attempt times
out. Note that the <em>RebootWatchdogSec=</em> timeout applies only to
the second phase of the reboot, i.e. after all regular services are
already terminated, and after the system and service manager process
(PID 1) got replaced by the systemd-shutdown binary, see system
<strong>bootup</strong>(7) for details. During the first phase of the
shutdown operation the system and service manager remains running and
hence <em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em> is still honoured. In order to define
a timeout on this first phase of system shutdown, configure
<em>JobTimeoutSec=</em> and <em>JobTimeoutAction=</em> in the [Unit]
section of the shutdown.target unit. By default
<em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em> defaults to 0 (off), and
<em>RebootWatchdogSec=</em> to 10min.</p>
<p><em>KExecWatchdogSec=</em> may be used to additionally enable the
watchdog when kexec is being executed rather than when rebooting. Note
that if the kernel does not reset the watchdog on kexec (depending on
the specific hardware and/or driver), in this case the watchdog might
not get disabled after kexec succeeds and thus the system might get
rebooted, unless <em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em> is also enabled at the
same time. For this reason it is recommended to enable
<em>KExecWatchdogSec=</em> only if <em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em> is also
enabled.</p>
<p>These settings have no effect if a hardware watchdog is not
available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the hardware watchdog device pre-timeout value. Takes a
timeout value in seconds (or in other time units similar to
<em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em>). A watchdog pre-timeout is a notification
generated by the watchdog before the watchdog reset might occur in the
event the watchdog has not been serviced. This notification is handled
by the kernel and can be configured to take an action (i.e. generate a
kernel panic) using <em>RuntimeWatchdogPreGovernor=</em>. Not all
watchdog hardware or drivers support generating a pre-timeout and
depending on the state of the system, the kernel may be unable to take
the configured action before the watchdog reboot. The watchdog will be
configured to generate the pre-timeout event at the amount of time
specified by <em>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</em> before the runtime watchdog
timeout (set by <em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em>). For example, if the we
have <em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=30</em> and
<em>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=10</em>, then the pre-timeout event will occur
if the watchdog has not pinged for 20s (10s before the watchdog would
fire). By default, <em>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</em> defaults to 0 (off).
The value set for <em>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</em> must be smaller than
the timeout value for <em>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</em>. This setting has no
effect if a hardware watchdog is not available or the hardware watchdog
does not support a pre-timeout and will be ignored by the kernel if the
setting is greater than the actual watchdog timeout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>RuntimeWatchdogPreGovernor=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the action taken by the hardware watchdog device when the
pre-timeout expires. The default action for the pre-timeout event
depends on the kernel configuration, but it is usually to log a kernel
message. For a list of valid actions available for a given watchdog
device, check the content of the
/sys/class/watchdog/watchdog<em>X</em>/pretimeout_available_governors
file. Typically, available governor types are <em>noop</em> and
<em>panic</em>. Availability, names and functionality might vary
depending on the specific device driver in use. If the
pretimeout_available_governors sysfs file is empty, the governor might
be built as a kernel module and might need to be manually loaded (e.g.
<em>pretimeout_noop.ko</em>), or the watchdog device might not support
pre-timeouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>WatchdogDevice=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the hardware watchdog device that the runtime and shutdown
watchdog timers will open and use. Defaults to /dev/watchdog0. This
setting has no effect if a hardware watchdog is not available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CapabilityBoundingSet=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls which capabilities to include in the capability bounding set
for PID 1 and its children. See <strong>capabilities</strong>(7) for
details. Takes a whitespace-separated list of capability names as read
by <strong>cap_from_name</strong>(3). Capabilities listed will be
included in the bounding set, all others are removed. If the list of
capabilities is prefixed with ~, all but the listed capabilities will be
included, the effect of the assignment inverted. Note that this option
also affects the respective capabilities in the effective, permitted and
inheritable capability sets. The capability bounding set may also be
individually configured for units using the
<em>CapabilityBoundingSet=</em> directive for units, but note that
capabilities dropped for PID 1 cannot be regained in individual units,
they are lost for good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NoNewPrivileges=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, ensures that PID 1 and all its
children can never gain new privileges through
<strong>execve</strong>(2) (e.g. via setuid or setgid bits, or
filesystem capabilities). Defaults to false. General purpose
distributions commonly rely on executables with setuid or setgid bits
and will thus not function properly with this option enabled. Individual
units cannot disable this option. Also see <strong>No New Privileges
Flag</strong>[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SystemCallArchitectures=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers. Selects
from which architectures system calls may be invoked on this system.
This may be used as an effective way to disable invocation of non-native
binaries system-wide, for example to prohibit execution of 32-bit x86
binaries on 64-bit x86-64 systems. This option operates system-wide, and
acts similar to the <em>SystemCallArchitectures=</em> setting of unit
files, see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) for details. This setting
defaults to the empty list, in which case no filtering of system calls
based on architecture is applied. Known architecture identifiers are
"x86", "x86-64", "x32", "arm" and the special identifier "native". The
latter implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more
specifically, the architecture the system manager was compiled for). Set
this setting to "native" to prohibit execution of any non-native
binaries. When a binary executes a system call of an architecture that
is not listed in this setting, it will be immediately terminated with
the SIGSYS signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>TimerSlackNSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the timer slack in nanoseconds for PID 1, which is inherited by
all executed processes, unless overridden individually, for example with
the <em>TimerSlackNSec=</em> setting in service units (for details see
<strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5)). The timer slack controls the accuracy
of wake-ups triggered by system timers. See <strong>prctl</strong>(2)
for more information. Note that in contrast to most other time span
definitions this parameter takes an integer value in nano-seconds if no
unit is specified. The usual time units are understood too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>StatusUnitFormat=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes <strong>name</strong>, <strong>description</strong> or
<strong>combined</strong> as the value. If <strong>name</strong>, the
system manager will use unit names in status messages (e.g.
"systemd-journald.service"), instead of the longer and more informative
descriptions set with <em>Description=</em> (e.g. "Journal Logging
Service"). If <strong>combined</strong>, the system manager will use
both unit names and descriptions in status messages (e.g.
"systemd-journald.service - Journal Logging Service").</p>
<p>See <strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5) for details about unit names and
<em>Description=</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultTimerAccuracySec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the default accuracy of timer units. This controls the global
default for the <em>AccuracySec=</em> setting of timer units, see
<strong>systemd.timer</strong>(5) for details. <em>AccuracySec=</em> set
in individual units override the global default for the specific unit.
Defaults to 1min. Note that the accuracy of timer units is also affected
by the configured timer slack for PID 1, see <em>TimerSlackNSec=</em>
above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</em>, <em>DefaultTimeoutStopSec=</em>,
<em>DefaultTimeoutAbortSec=</em>, <em>DefaultRestartSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the default timeouts for starting, stopping and aborting
of units, as well as the default time to sleep between automatic
restarts of units, as configured per-unit in <em>TimeoutStartSec=</em>,
<em>TimeoutStopSec=</em>, <em>TimeoutAbortSec=</em> and
<em>RestartSec=</em> (for services, see
<strong>systemd.service</strong>(5) for details on the per-unit
settings). Disabled by default, when service with <em>Type=oneshot</em>
is used. For non-service units, <em>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</em> sets
the default <em>TimeoutSec=</em> value. <em>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</em>
and <em>DefaultTimeoutStopSec=</em> default to 90s.
<em>DefaultTimeoutAbortSec=</em> is not set by default so that all units
fall back to <em>TimeoutStopSec=</em>. <em>DefaultRestartSec=</em>
defaults to 100ms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultDeviceTimeoutSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the default timeout for waiting for devices. It can be
changed per device via the <em>x-systemd.device-timeout=</em> option in
/etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab (see <strong>systemd.mount</strong>(5),
<strong>crypttab</strong>(5)). Defaults to 90s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultStartLimitIntervalSec=</em>,
<em>DefaultStartLimitBurst=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the default unit start rate limiting, as configured
per-service by <em>StartLimitIntervalSec=</em> and
<em>StartLimitBurst=</em>. See <strong>systemd.service</strong>(5) for
details on the per-service settings.
<em>DefaultStartLimitIntervalSec=</em> defaults to 10s.
<em>DefaultStartLimitBurst=</em> defaults to 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultEnvironment=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures environment variables passed to all executed processes.
Takes a space-separated list of variable assignments. See
<strong>environ</strong>(7) for details about environment variables.</p>
<p>Simple "%"-specifier expansion is supported, see below for a list of
supported specifiers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>DefaultEnvironment=&quot;VAR1=word1 word2&quot; VAR2=word3 &quot;VAR3=word 5 6&quot;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Sets three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ManagerEnvironment=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the same arguments as <em>DefaultEnvironment=</em>, see above.
Sets environment variables just for the manager process itself. In
contrast to user managers, these variables are not inherited by
processes spawned by the system manager, use
<em>DefaultEnvironment=</em> for that. Note that these variables are
merged into the existing environment block. In particular, in case of
the system manager, this includes variables set by the kernel based on
the kernel command line.</p>
<p>Setting environment variables for the manager process may be useful
to modify its behaviour. See <strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong>[2] for a
descriptions of some variables understood by
<strong>systemd</strong>.</p>
<p>Simple "%"-specifier expansion is supported, see below for a list of
supported specifiers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultCPUAccounting=</em>, <em>DefaultMemoryAccounting=</em>,
<em>DefaultTasksAccounting=</em>, <em>DefaultIOAccounting=</em>,
<em>DefaultIPAccounting=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the default resource accounting settings, as configured
per-unit by <em>CPUAccounting=</em>, <em>MemoryAccounting=</em>,
<em>TasksAccounting=</em>, <em>IOAccounting=</em> and
<em>IPAccounting=</em>. See <strong>systemd.resource-control</strong>(5)
for details on the per-unit settings. <em>DefaultTasksAccounting=</em>
defaults to yes, <em>DefaultMemoryAccounting=</em> to yes.
<em>DefaultCPUAccounting=</em> defaults to yes, but really has no effect
if enabling CPU accounting doesnt require the <strong>cpu</strong>
controller to be enabled (Linux 4.15+ using the unified hierarchy for
resource control), otherwise it defaults to no. The other three settings
default to no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultTasksMax=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the default value for the per-unit <em>TasksMax=</em>
setting. See <strong>systemd.resource-control</strong>(5) for details.
This setting applies to all unit types that support resource control
settings, with the exception of slice units. Defaults to 15% of the
minimum of <em>kernel.pid_max=</em>, <em>kernel.threads-max=</em> and
root cgroup <em>pids.max</em>. Kernel has a default value for
<em>kernel.pid_max=</em> and an algorithm of counting in case of more
than 32 cores. For example with the default <em>kernel.pid_max=</em>,
<em>DefaultTasksMax=</em> defaults to 4915, but might be greater in
other systems or smaller in OS containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultLimitCPU=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitFSIZE=</em>,
<em>DefaultLimitDATA=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitSTACK=</em>,
<em>DefaultLimitCORE=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitRSS=</em>,
<em>DefaultLimitNOFILE=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitAS=</em>,
<em>DefaultLimitNPROC=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitMEMLOCK=</em>,
<em>DefaultLimitLOCKS=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitSIGPENDING=</em>,
<em>DefaultLimitMSGQUEUE=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitNICE=</em>,
<em>DefaultLimitRTPRIO=</em>, <em>DefaultLimitRTTIME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These settings control various default resource limits for processes
executed by units. See <strong>setrlimit</strong>(2) for details. These
settings may be overridden in individual units using the corresponding
<em>LimitXXX=</em> directives and they accept the same parameter syntax,
see <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) for details. Note that these
resource limits are only defaults for units, they are not applied to the
service manager process (i.e. PID 1) itself.</p>
<p>Most of these settings are unset, which means the resource limits are
inherited from the kernel or, if invoked in a container, from the
container manager. However, the following have defaults:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><em>DefaultLimitNOFILE=</em> defaults to 1024:524288.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><em>DefaultLimitMEMLOCK=</em> defaults to 8M.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><em>DefaultLimitCORE=</em> does not have a default but it is worth
mentioning that <em>RLIMIT_CORE</em> is set to "infinity" by PID 1 which
is inherited by its children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the service manager internally in PID 1 bumps
<em>RLIMIT_NOFILE</em> and <em>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</em> to higher values,
however the limit is reverted to the mentioned defaults for all child
processes forked off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultOOMPolicy=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the default policy for reacting to processes being killed
by the Linux Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer or
<strong>systemd-oomd</strong>. This may be used to pick a global default
for the per-unit <em>OOMPolicy=</em> setting. See
<strong>systemd.service</strong>(5) for details. Note that this default
is not used for services that have <em>Delegate=</em> turned on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultOOMScoreAdjust=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the default OOM score adjustments of processes run by the
service manager. This defaults to unset (meaning the forked off
processes inherit the service managers OOM score adjustment value),
except if the service manager is run for an unprivileged user, in which
case this defaults to the service managers OOM adjustment value plus 100
(this makes service processes slightly more likely to be killed under
memory pressure than the manager itself). This may be used to pick a
global default for the per-unit <em>OOMScoreAdjust=</em> setting. See
<strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) for details. Note that this setting has
no effect on the OOM score adjustment value of the service manager
process itself, it retains the original value set during its
invocation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DefaultSmackProcessLabel=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a <strong>SMACK64</strong> security label as the argument. The
process executed by a unit will be started under this label if
<em>SmackProcessLabel=</em> is not set in the unit. See
<strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) for the details.</p>
<p>If the value is "/", only labels specified with
<em>SmackProcessLabel=</em> are assigned and the compile-time default is
ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
