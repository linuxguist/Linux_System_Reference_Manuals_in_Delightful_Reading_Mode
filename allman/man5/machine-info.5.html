<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>machine-info - Local machine information file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/machine-info</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The /etc/machine-info file contains machine metadata.</p>
<p>The format of machine-info is a newline-separated list of
environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments, ignoring
comments and empty lines. It is possible to source the configuration
from shell scripts, however, beyond mere variable assignments no shell
features are supported, allowing applications to read the file without
implementing a shell compatible execution engine. See
<strong>os-release</strong>(5) for a detailed description of the
format.</p>
<p>/etc/machine-info contains metadata about the machine that is set by
the user or administrator. The settings configured here have the highest
precedence. When not set, appropriate values may be determined
automatically, based on the information about the hardware or other
configuration files. It is thus completely fine for this file to not be
present.</p>
<p>You may use <strong>hostnamectl</strong>(1) to change the settings of
this file from the command line.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following machine metadata parameters may be set using
/etc/machine-info:</p>
<p><em>PRETTY_HOSTNAME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pretty human-readable UTF-8 machine identifier string. This should
contain a name like "Lennarts Laptop" which is useful to present to the
user and does not suffer by the syntax limitations of internet domain
names. If possible, the internet hostname as configured in /etc/hostname
should be kept similar to this one. Example: if this value is "Lennarts
Computer" an Internet hostname of "lennarts-computer" might be a good
choice. If this parameter is not set, an application should fall back to
the Internet hostname for presentation purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ICON_NAME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An icon identifying this machine according to the <strong>XDG Icon
Naming Specification</strong>[1]. If this parameter is not set, an
application should fall back to "computer" or a similar icon name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CHASSIS=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chassis type. Currently, the following chassis types are defined:
"desktop", "laptop", "convertible", "server", "tablet", "handset",
"watch", and "embedded", as well as the special chassis types "vm" and
"container" for virtualized systems that lack an immediate physical
chassis.</p>
<p>Note that most systems allow detection of the chassis type
automatically (based on firmware information or suchlike). This setting
should only be used to override a misdetection or to manually configure
the chassis type where automatic detection is not available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DEPLOYMENT=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Describes the system deployment environment. One of the following is
suggested: "development", "integration", "staging", "production".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>LOCATION=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Describes the system location if applicable and known. Takes a
human-friendly, free-form string. This may be as generic as "Berlin,
Germany" or as specific as "Left Rack, 2nd Shelf".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>HARDWARE_VENDOR=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the hardware vendor. If unspecified, the hardware vendor
set in DMI or <strong>hwdb</strong>(7) will be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>HARDWARE_MODEL=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the hardware model. If unspecified, the hardware model set
in DMI or <strong>hwdb</strong>(7) will be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>PRETTY_HOSTNAME=&quot;Lennarts Tablet&quot;
