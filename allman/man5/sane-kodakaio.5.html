<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-kodakaio - SANE backend for Kodak aio printer / scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-kodakaio</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to Kodak aio
printer/scanners, like the ESP and Hero series.</p>
<p>This document describes backend version 2.4, which is the first
candidate for incorporation in sane-backends.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>This version should support models of the Kodak ESP and Hero series,
and possibly some Advent AiO scanners. The ESP 5250 and Hero 9.1 were
used to develop the backend, but other models may work. Please see the
supported devices list at
<em>http://www.sane-project.org/sane-backends.html#S-KODAKAIO</em>.</p>
<p>If you have a model not on that list, or reported as 'untested': the
best way to determine level of support is to test the scanner
directly.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILE</h1>
<p>The configuration file <em>kodakaio.conf</em> is used to tell the
backend how to look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the frontend asks
the backend for a list of scanners, generally only when the frontend
starts.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_KODAKAIO</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. Higher
debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>KNOWN ISSUES</h1>
<p>Most hardware options are either not supported or not exposed for
control by the user, including: multifeed detection, image compression
etc.</p>
