<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-sysusers</strong> uses the files from sysusers.d
directory to create system users and groups and to add users to groups,
at package installation or boot time. This tool may be used to allocate
system users and groups only, it is not useful for creating non-system
(i.e. regular, "human") users and groups, as it accesses /etc/passwd and
/etc/group directly, bypassing any more complex user databases, for
example any database involving NIS or LDAP.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1>
<p>Each configuration file shall be named in the style of
<em>package</em>.conf or <em>package</em>-<em>part</em>.conf. The second
variant should be used when it is desirable to make it easy to override
just this part of configuration.</p>
<p>Files in /etc/sysusers.d override files with the same name in
/usr/lib/sysusers.d and /run/sysusers.d. Files in /run/sysusers.d
override files with the same name in /usr/lib/sysusers.d. Packages
should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/sysusers.d. Files
in /etc/sysusers.d are reserved for the local administrator, who may use
this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor
packages. All configuration files are sorted by their filename in
lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside
in. If multiple files specify the same path, the entry in the file with
the lexicographically earliest name will be applied. All later entries
for the same user and group names will be logged as warnings.</p>
<p>If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied
by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in
/etc/sysusers.d/ bearing the same filename.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT</h1>
<p>The file format is one line per user or group containing name, ID,
GECOS field description, home directory, and login shell:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>#Type Name     ID             GECOS                 Home directory Shell
u     httpd    404            &quot;HTTP User&quot;
u     _authd   /usr/bin/authd &quot;Authorization user&quot;
u     postgres -              &quot;Postgresql Database&quot; /var/lib/pgsql /libexec/postgresdb
g     input    -              -
m     _authd   input
u     root     0              &quot;Superuser&quot;           /root          /bin/zsh
r     -        500-900</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Empty lines and lines beginning with the "#" character are ignored,
and may be used for commenting.</p>
<h2>Type</h2>
<p>The type consists of a single letter. The following line types are
understood:</p>
<p><em>u</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a system user and group of the specified name should they not
exist yet. The users primary group will be set to the group bearing the
same name unless the ID field specifies it. The account will be created
disabled, so that logins are not allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>g</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a system group of the specified name should it not exist yet.
Note that <em>u</em> implicitly creates a matching group. The group will
be created with no password set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>m</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a user to a group. If the user or group do not exist yet, they
will be implicitly created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>r</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a range of numeric UIDs/GIDs to the pool to allocate new UIDs and
GIDs from. If no line of this type is specified, the range of UIDs/GIDs
is set to some compiled-in default. Note that both UIDs and GIDs are
allocated from the same pool, in order to ensure that users and groups
of the same name are likely to carry the same numeric UID and GID.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The name field specifies the user or group name. The specified name
must consist only of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, "_" and "-", except
for the first character which must be one of a-z, A-Z or "_" (i.e.
numbers and "-" are not permitted as first character). The user/group
name must have at least one character, and at most 31.</p>
<p>For further details about the syntax of user/group names, see
<strong>User/Group Name Syntax</strong>[1].</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to pick user and group names that are
unlikely to clash with normal users created by the administrator. A good
scheme to guarantee this is by prefixing all system and group names with
the underscore, and avoiding too generic names.</p>
<p>For <em>m</em> lines, this field should contain the user name to add
to a group.</p>
<p>For lines of type <em>r</em>, this field should be set to "-".</p>
<h2>ID</h2>
<p>For <em>u</em> and <em>g</em>, the numeric 32-bit UID or GID of the
user/group. Do not use IDs 65535 or 4294967295, as they have special
placeholder meanings. Specify "-" for automatic UID/GID allocation for
the user or group (this is strongly recommended unless it is strictly
necessary to use a specific UID or GID). Alternatively, specify an
absolute path in the file system. In this case, the UID/GID is read from
the paths owner/group. This is useful to create users whose UID/GID
match the owners of pre-existing files (such as SUID or SGID binaries).
The syntaxes "<em>uid</em>:<em>gid</em>" and
"<em>uid</em>:<em>groupname</em>" are supported to allow creating users
with specific primary groups. The given group must be created
explicitly, or it must already exist. Specifying "-" for the UID in
these syntaxes is also supported.</p>
<p>For <em>m</em> lines, this field should contain the group name to add
to a user to.</p>
<p>For lines of type <em>r</em>, this field should be set to a UID/GID
range in the format "FROM-TO", where both values are formatted as
decimal ASCII numbers. Alternatively, a single UID/GID may be specified
formatted as decimal ASCII numbers.</p>
<h2>GECOS</h2>
<p>A short, descriptive string for users to be created, enclosed in
quotation marks. Note that this field may not contain colons.</p>
<p>Only applies to lines of type <em>u</em> and should otherwise be left
unset (or "-").</p>
<h2>Home Directory</h2>
<p>The home directory for a new system user. If omitted, defaults to the
root directory.</p>
<p>Only applies to lines of type <em>u</em> and should otherwise be left
unset (or "-"). It is recommended to omit this, unless software strictly
requires a home directory to be set.</p>
<p><strong>systemd-sysusers</strong> only sets the home directory record
in the user database. To actually create the directory, consider adding
a corresponding <strong>tmpfiles.d</strong>(5) fragment.</p>
<h2>Shell</h2>
<p>The login shell of the user. If not specified, this will be set to
/usr/sbin/nologin, except if the UID of the user is 0, in which case
/bin/sh will be used.</p>
<p>Only applies to lines of type <em>u</em> and should otherwise be left
unset (or "-"). It is recommended to omit this, unless a shell different
/usr/sbin/nologin must be used.</p>
<h1>SPECIFIERS</h1>
<p>Specifiers can be used in the "Name", "ID", "GECOS", "Home
directory", and "Shell" fields. An unknown or unresolvable specifier is
treated as invalid configuration. The following expansions are
understood:</p>

<h1>IDEMPOTENCE</h1>
<p>Note that <strong>systemd-sysusers</strong> will do nothing if the
specified users or groups already exist or the users are members of
specified groups, so normally there is no reason to override sysusers.d
vendor configuration, except to block certain users or groups from being
created.</p>
