<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>/etc/deluser.conf - configuration file for
<strong>deluser</strong>(8) and <strong>delgroup</strong>(8).</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The file <em>/etc/deluser.conf</em> contains defaults for the
programs <strong>deluser(8)</strong> and
<strong><strong>delgroup</strong>(8).</strong> Each line holds a single
value pair in the form <em>option</em> = <em>value</em>. Double or
single quotes are allowed around the value, as is whitespace around the
equals sign. Comment lines must have a hash sign (#) in the first
column.</p>
<p><strong>deluser</strong>(8) and <strong>delgroup</strong>(8) also
read <em>/etc/adduser.conf</em>, see <strong>adduser.conf</strong>(5);
settings in <em>deluser.conf</em> may overwrite settings made in
<em>adduser.conf</em>.</p>
<p>The valid configuration options are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>BACKUP</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>REMOVE_HOME</strong> or <strong>REMOVE_ALL_FILES</strong>
is activated, all files are backed up before they are removed. The
backup file that is created defaults to <em>username.tar(.gz|.bz2)</em>
in the directory specified by the <strong>BACKUP_TO</strong> option. The
compression method is chosen to the best that is available. Values may
be 0 or 1. Defaults to <em>0</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>BACKUP_SUFFIX</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Select compression algorithm for a home directory backup. Can be set
to any suffix recognized by <strong>tar --auto-compress</strong>.
Defaults to <em>.gz</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>BACKUP_TO</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>BACKUP</strong> is activated, <strong>BACKUP_TO</strong>
specifies the directory the backup is written to. Defaults to the
current directory.</p>

<dt><strong>NO_DEL_PATHS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of regular expressions, space separated. All files to be
deleted in course of deleting the home directory or user-owned files
elsewhere are checked against each of these regular expressions. If a
match is detected, the file is not deleted. Defaults to a list of system
directories, leaving only <em>/home</em>. Therefore only files below
<em>/home</em> belonging to that specific user are going to be
deleted.</p>
