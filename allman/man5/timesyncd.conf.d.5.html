<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>timesyncd.conf, timesyncd.conf.d - Network Time Synchronization
configuration files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</p>
<p>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/run/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/usr/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These configuration files control NTP network time synchronization.
See <strong>systemd.syntax</strong>(7) for a general description of the
syntax.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1>
<p>The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration
is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults.
Initially, the main configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains
commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by
creating drop-ins, as described below. Using drop-ins for local
configuration is recommended over modifications to the main
configuration file.</p>
<p>In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration
snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those
drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration
file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option,
for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file
sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.</p>
<p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install
drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local
administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration
files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override
package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower
precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the
ordering of the files.</p>
<p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
file.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following settings are configured in the [Time] section:</p>
<p><em>NTP=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses.
During runtime this list is combined with any per-interface NTP servers
acquired from <strong>systemd-networkd.service</strong>(8).
<strong>systemd-timesyncd</strong> will contact all configured system or
per-interface servers in turn, until one responds. When the empty string
is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset, and all prior assignments
will have no effect. This setting defaults to an empty list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>FallbackNTP=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses to be
used as the fallback NTP servers. Any per-interface NTP servers obtained
from <strong>systemd-networkd.service</strong>(8) take precedence over
this setting, as do any servers set via <em>NTP=</em> above. This
setting is hence only relevant if no other NTP server information is
known. When the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is
reset, and all prior assignments will have no effect. If this option is
not given, a compiled-in list of NTP servers is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>RootDistanceMaxSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum acceptable root distance, i.e. the maximum estimated time
required for a packet to travel to the server we are connected to from
the server with the reference clock. If the current server does not
satisfy this limit, <strong>systemd-timesyncd</strong> will switch to a
different server.</p>
<p>Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units
may be specified, see <strong>systemd.time</strong>(5). Defaults to 5
seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PollIntervalMinSec=</em>, <em>PollIntervalMaxSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP messages. Polling
starts at the minimum poll interval, and is adjusted within the
specified limits in response to received packets.</p>
<p>Each setting takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds,
but other units may be specified, see <strong>systemd.time</strong>(5).
<em>PollIntervalMinSec=</em> defaults to 32 seconds and must not be
smaller than 16 seconds. <em>PollIntervalMaxSec=</em> defaults to 34 min
8 s (2048 seconds) and must be larger than
<em>PollIntervalMinSec=</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ConnectionRetrySec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the minimum delay before subsequent attempts to contact a
new NTP server are made.</p>
<p>Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units
may be specified, see <strong>systemd.time</strong>(5). Defaults to 30
seconds and must not be smaller than 1 second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SaveIntervalSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interval at which the current time is periodically saved to disk,
in the absence of any recent synchronisation from an NTP server. This is
especially useful for offline systems with no local RTC, as it will
guarantee that the system clock remains roughly monotonic across
reboots.</p>
<p>Takes a time interval value. The default unit is seconds, but other
units may be specified, see <strong>systemd.time</strong>(5). Defaults
to 60 seconds.</p>
