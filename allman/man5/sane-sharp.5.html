<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-sharp - SANE backend for SHARP scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-sharp</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Sharp SCSI scanners.
This backend should be considered <strong>beta-quality</strong>
software! In the current state it is known to work with JX-610 and
JX-250 scanners. It is prepared for usage with the JX-330 series
scanners, but we are not able to test it with these devices.</p>
<p>For other Sharp scanners, it may or may not work.</p>
<p>At present, the following scanners are known to work with this
backend.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Vendor  Product id:
-----   -----------
Sharp   JX-610
Sharp   JX-250
Sharp   JX-320
Sharp   JX-330
Sharp   JX-350</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The following scanners are detected by the backend, but not
tested:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Vendor  Product id:
-----   -----------
Sharp   JX-325</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>This backend expects device names of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>special</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>special</em> is the path-name for the special device that
corresponds to a SCSI scanner. The special device name must be a generic
SCSI device or a symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a device
name could be <em>/dev/sga</em> or <em>/dev/sge</em>, for example. See
<strong>sane-scsi</strong>(5) for details.</p>

<h1>ADF USAGE</h1>
<p>If a paper jam occurrs, the maintenance cover <em>must</em> be opened
and closed, even if the jammed paper can be removed without opening the
maintenance cover. Otherwise, the error condition will not be
cleared.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>sharp.conf</em> file is a list of options and
device names that correspond to Sharp scanners. Empty lines and lines
beginning with a hash mark (#) are ignored. See
<strong>sane-scsi</strong>(5) for details about device names.</p>
<p>Lines setting an option start with the key word
<strong>option,</strong> followed by the option's name and the option's
value. At present, three options are defined: <strong>buffers,
buffersize,</strong> and <strong>readqueue.</strong></p>
<p>Options defined at the start of <em>sharp.conf</em> apply to all
devices; options defined after a device name apply to this device.</p>
<p>The options <strong>buffers</strong> and <strong>readqueue</strong>
are only significant if the backend has been compiled so that for each
scan a second process is forked (switch <strong>USE_FORK</strong> in
<em>sharp.c</em> ). This process reads the scan data from the scanner
and writes this data into a block of shared memory. The parent process
reads the data from this memory block and delivers it to the frontend.
The options control the size and usage of this shared memory block.</p>
<p><strong>option buffers</strong> defines the number of buffers used.
The smallest number allowed is 2.</p>
<p><strong>option buffersize</strong> defines the size of one buffer.
Since each buffer is filled with a single read command sent to the
scanner, its size is limited automatically to the size allowed by the
operating system or by the Sane SCSI library for SCSI read commands. A
buffer size of 128 kB or 256 kB is recommended for scan resolutions of
300 dpi and above.</p>
<p><strong>option readqueue</strong> defines how many read commands to
be sent to the scanner are queued. At present, the Sane SCSI library
supports queued read commands only for for Linux. For other operating
systems, <strong>option readqueue</strong> should be set to 0. For
Linux, <strong>option readqueue</strong> should be set to 2. Larger
values than 2 for <strong>option readqueue</strong> are not reasonable
in most cases. <strong>option buffers</strong> should be greater than
<strong>option readqueue.</strong></p>
<h1>Performance Considerations</h1>
<p>This section focuses on the problem of stops of the scanner's
carriage during a scan. Carriage stops happen mainly with the JX-250.
This scanner has obviously only a small internal buffer compared to its
speed. That means that the backend must read the data as fast as
possible from the scanner in order to avoid carriage stops.</p>
<p>Even the JX-250 needs only less than 10 seconds for a 400 dpi A4 gray
scale scan, which results in a data transfer rate of more than 1.6 MB
per second. This means that the data produced by the scanner must be
processed fairly fast. Due to the small internal buffer of the JX-250,
the backend must issue a read request for the next data block as soon as
possible after reading a block of data in order to avoid carriage
stops.</p>
<p>Stops of the carriage can be caused by the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- too much "traffic" on the SCSI bus<br />
- slow responses by the backend to the scanner,<br />
- a program which processes the data acquired by the backend too
slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too much "traffic" on the SCSI bus: This happens for example, if hard
disks are connected to the same SCSI bus as the scanner, and when data
transfer from/to these hard disks requires a considerable part of the
SCSI bandwidth during a scan. If this is the case, you should consider
to connect the scanner to a separate SCSI adapter.</p>
<p>Slow responses by the backend to the scanner: Unfortunately,
UNIX-like operating systems generally have no real time capabilities.
Thus there is no guarantee that the backend is under any circumstances
able to communicate with the scanner as fast as required. To minimize
this problem, the backend should be compiled so that a separate reader
process is forked: Make sure that <strong>USE_FORK</strong> is defined
when you compile <em>sharp.c.</em> If slow responses of the backend
remain to be problem, you could try to reduce the load of the system.
Even while the backend and the reader process need only a minor amount
of processor time, other running processes can cause an increase in the
time delay between two time slices given to the reader process. On
slower systems, such an increased delay can be enough to cause a
carriage stop with the JX-250. For Linux, the usage of the SG driver
version 2.1.36 or above is recommended, because it supports, in
combination with the SCSI library of Sane version 1.0.2, command
queueing within the kernel. This queueing implementation, combined with
a buffer size of at least 128 kB, should avoid most carriage stops.</p>
<p>Slow processing of the scan data: An example for this situation is
the access to the scanner via a 10 MBit Ethernet, which is definitely
too slow to transfer the scan data as fast as they are produced by the
scanner. If you have enough memory available, you can increase
<strong>option buffers,</strong> so that an entire image can be stored
in these buffers.</p>
<p>In order to see, if the backend is too slow or if the further
processing of the data is too slow, set the environment variable
<strong>SANE_DEBUG_SHARP</strong> to 1. When a scan is finished, the
backend writes the line "buffer full conditions: <em>nn</em>""" to
stderr. If <em>nn</em> is zero, carriage stops are caused by too slow
responses of the backend or too much "traffic" on the SCSI bus. If
<em>nn</em> is greater than zero, the backend had to wait <em>nn</em>
times until a buffer has been processed by the frontend. (Please note
that <strong>option buffers</strong> must be greater than <strong>option
readqueue</strong> in order to get useful output for "buffer full
conditions".)</p>

<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_SHARP</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>KNOWN PROBLEMS</h1>
<p>1. ADF Mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After several ADF scans, the scanner moves the carriage back to the
idle position and back to ADF scan position, before a scan starts. We do
not know, if this is a problem of the scanner, or if this is a bug of
the backend. At present, the scanner must power off and on to stop this
annoying behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. Threshold level does not work (only JX-610)</p>
<p>3. The maximum resolution is limited to 600 dpi(JX-610 supported to
1200 dpi) resp. 400 dpi (JX-250)</p>
<p>4. If the JX250 is used with an ADF, the following situation can
occur: After several scans, the scanner moves, after loading a new sheet
of paper, the carriage to the idle position, and then back to the
position used for ADF scans. This happens for <em>every</em> scan, in
contrast to the calibration, which is done after 10 scans. (For the
calibration, the carriage is also moved to the idle position.) We do not
know if this behavior is caused by the backend, or if it is a bug in the
firmware of the scanner.</p>
<p>5. Usage of a transparency adapter (film scan unit) is supported, but
not tested.</p>
