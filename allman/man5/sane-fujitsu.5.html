<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-fujitsu - SANE backend for Fujitsu flatbed and ADF scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-fujitsu</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to most Fujitsu flatbed
and ADF scanners.</p>
<p>This document describes backend version 139, which initially shipped
with SANE 1.1.2.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>This version supports every known model which speaks the Fujitsu SCSI
and SCSI-over-USB protocols. Specifically, the SCSI M309x and M409x
series, the SCSI fi-series, and most of the USB fi-, ScanSnap, &amp; iX
series scanners are supported. Please see the list at
<em>http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html</em> for
details.</p>
<p>This backend may support other Fujitsu scanners. The best way to
determine level of support is to test the scanner directly, or to
collect a trace of the windows driver in action. Please contact the
author for help or with test results.</p>
<h1>UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>The following scanners are known NOT to work with this backend,
either because they have a non-Fujitsu chipset, or an unsupported
interface type. Some of these scanners may be supported by another
backend.</p>
<blockquote>

                          SP-2x/3x</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Effort has been made to expose all hardware options, including:</p>
<p><strong>source s</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selects the source for the scan. Options may include "Flatbed", "ADF
Front", "ADF Back", "ADF Duplex", "Card Front", "Card Back", "Card
Duplex".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mode m</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selects the mode for the scan. Options may include "Lineart",
"Halftone", "Gray", and "Color".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>resolution, y-resolution</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls scan resolution. Setting <strong>--resolution</strong> also
sets <strong>--y-resolution,</strong> though this behavior is overridden
by some frontends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tl-x, tl-y, br-x, br-y</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets scan area upper left and lower right coordinates. These are
renamed <strong>t, l, x, y</strong> by some frontends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>page-width, page-height</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets paper size. Used by scanner to determine centering of scan
coordinates when using the ADF (Automatic Document Feeder) and to detect
double feed errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the
scanner: machines with IPC or DTC will have additional enhancement
options, those with CMP will have compression options, those with a
printer will have a group of endorser options.</p>
<p>Additionally, several 'software' options are exposed by the backend.
These are reimplementations of features provided natively by larger
scanners, but running on the host computer. This enables smaller
machines to have similar capabilities. Please note that these features
are somewhat simplistic, and may not perform as well as the native
implementations. Note also that these features all require that the
driver cache the entire image in memory. This will almost certainly
result in a reduction of scanning speed.</p>
<p><strong>swcrop</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests the driver to detect the extremities of the paper within the
larger image, and crop the empty edges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>swdeskew</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests the driver to detect the rotation of the paper within the
larger image, and counter the rotation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>swdespeck X</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests the driver to find and remove dots of X diameter or smaller
from the image, and fill the space with the average surrounding
color.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use <em>'scanimage --help'</em> to get a list, but be aware that some
options may be settable only when another option has been set, and that
advanced options may be hidden by some frontend programs.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILE</h1>
<p>The configuration file <em>fujitsu.conf</em> is used to tell the
backend how to look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the frontend asks
the backend for a list of scanners, generally only when the frontend
starts. If the configuration file is missing, the backend will be unable
to locate any scanners.</p>
<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4 ways:</p>
<p>"scsi FUJITSU"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests backend to search all scsi buses in the system for a device
which reports itself to be a scanner made by 'FUJITSU'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"scsi /dev/sg0" (or other scsi device file)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful if you
have multiple compatible scanners connected to your system, and need to
specify one. Probably should not be used with the other "scsi" line
above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"usb 0x04c5 0x1042" (or other vendor/product ids)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests backend to search all usb buses in the system for a device
which uses that vendor and product id. The device will then be queried
to determine if it is a Fujitsu scanner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"usb /dev/usb/scanner0" (or other device file)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners. This method
is untested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only configuration option supported is "buffer-size=xxx",
allowing you to set the number of bytes in the data buffer to something
other than the compiled-in default, 65536 (64K). Some users report that
their scanner will "hang" mid-page, or fail to transmit the image if the
buffer is not large enough.</p>
<p>Note: This option may appear multiple times in the configuration
file. It only applies to scanners discovered by 'scsi/usb' lines that
follow this option.</p>
<p>Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this value, as
some users required it to be quite large. Values above the default are
not recommended, and may crash your OS or lockup your scsi card driver.
You have been warned.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>The backend uses a single environment variable,
<strong>SANE_DEBUG_FUJITSU</strong>, which enables debugging output to
stderr. Valid values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Errors<br />
10 Function trace<br />
15 Function detail<br />
20 Option commands<br />
25 SCSI/USB trace<br />
30 SCSI/USB writes<br />
31 SCSI/USB reads<br />
35 Useless noise</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>KNOWN ISSUES</h1>
<p>Flatbed units may fail to scan at maximum area, particularly at high
resolution.</p>
<p>Any model that does not support VPD during inquiry will not function
until an override is added to the backend.</p>
<p>CCITT Fax compression used by older scanners is not supported.</p>
<p>JPEG output is supported by the backend, but not by the SANE
protocol, so is disabled in this release. It can be enabled if you
rebuild from source.</p>
<p>Network interfaces are not supported on any scanner model.</p>
