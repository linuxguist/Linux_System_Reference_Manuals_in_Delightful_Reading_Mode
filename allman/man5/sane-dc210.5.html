<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-dc210 - SANE backend for Kodak DC210 Digital Camera</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-dc210</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the Kodak DC210 camera.
THIS IS EXTREMELY ALPHA CODE! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!</p>
<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>The current version of the backend only allows one camera to be
connected. The device name is always "0".</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>dc210.conf</em> specify the serial port and
baud rate to use. The <strong>baud</strong> rate specifies the maximum
rate to use while downloading pictures. (The camera is always
initialized using 9600 baud, then switches to the higher rate). On my
90MHz Pentium, I usually have no problems downloading at 115200 baud as
long as the system is not excessively busy and the "interrupt-unmask
flag" is set in the IDE driver (<em>hdparm -u1</em>). Supported baud
rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.</p>
<p>The <strong>dumpinquiry</strong> line causes some information about
the camera to be printed.</p>
<p><strong>cmdrespause</strong> specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of
a second) to wait between writing the command and reading the result.
125000 seems to be the lowest I could go reliably.</p>
<p><strong>breakpause</strong> specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of
a second) between sending the "back to default" break and sending
commands.</p>
<p>Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A
sample configuration file is shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>port=/dev/ttyS0<br />
# this is a comment<br />
baud=115200<br />
dumpinquiry<br />
cmdrespause=125000<br />
breakpause=1000000</p>

<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/dc210.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The backend configuration file (see also description of
<strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc210.a</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc210.so</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in <em>/etc/sane.d.</em> If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories <em>tmp/config</em>,
<em>.</em>, and <em>/etc/sane.d</em> being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_DC210</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. A value
of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>
</dd>

<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
<p>Brian J. Murrell</p>
<p>This backend is based somewhat on the dc25 backend included in this
package by Peter Fales.</p>
<p>The manpage was copied from the dc25 backend and somewhat edited by
Henning Meier-Geinitz.</p>
