<p>The</p>
<p>file is used to configure the</p>
<p>log server. It uses an INI-style format made up of sections in square
brackets and</p>
<p>pairs specific to each section below the section name. Depending on
the key, values may be integers, booleans, or strings. Section and key
names are not case sensitive, but values are.</p>
<p>The pound sign</p>
<p>is used to indicate a comment. Both the comment character and any
text after it, up to the end of the line, are ignored. Lines beginning
with a semi-colon</p>
<p>are also ignored.</p>
<p>Long lines can be continued with a backslash</p>
<p>as the last character on the line. Leading white space is removed
from the beginning of lines even when the continuation character is
used.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>section contains a copy of the default</p>
<p>file.</p>
<p>The following configuration sections are recognized:</p>
<p>server</p>
<p>relay</p>
<p>iolog</p>
<p>eventlog</p>
<p>syslog</p>
<p>logfile</p>
<p>Each section is described in detail below.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>section configures the address and port the server will listen on.
The following keys are recognized:</p>
<p>The host name or IP address, optional port to listen on and an
optional Transport Layer Security (TLS) flag in parentheses.</p>
<p>The host may be a host name, an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address in
square brackets or the wild card entry</p>
<p>A host setting of</p>
<p>will cause</p>
<p>to listen on all configured network interfaces.</p>
<p>If the optional tls flag is present,</p>
<p>will secure the connection with TLS version 1.2 or 1.3. Versions of
TLS prior to 1.2 are not supported. See</p>
<p>for details on generating TLS keys and certificates.</p>
<p>If a port is specified, it may either be a port number or a known
service name as defined by the system service name database. If no port
is specified, port 30343 will be used for plaintext connections and port
30344 will be used for TLS connections.</p>
<p>The default value is:</p>
<p>listen_address = *:30343 listen_address = *:30344(tls)</p>
<p>which will listen on all configured network interfaces for both
plaintext and TLS connections. Multiple</p>
<p>lines may be specified to listen on more than one port or
interface.</p>
<p>Where to log server warning and error messages. Supported values
are</p>
<p>or a path name beginning with the</p>
<p>character. A value of</p>
<p>is only effective when used in conjunction with the</p>
<p>option. The default value is</p>
<p>The path to the file containing the process ID of the running</p>
<p>If set to an empty value, or if</p>
<p>is run with the</p>
<p>option, no</p>

<p>refers to a symbolic link, it will be ignored. The default value
is</p>
<p>If true,</p>
<p>will enable the TCP keepalive socket option on the client connection.
This enables the periodic transmission of keepalive messages to the
client. If the client does not respond to a message in time, the
connection will be closed. Defaults to</p>
<p>The amount of time, in seconds,</p>
<p>will wait for the client to respond. A value of 0 will disable the
timeout. The default value is</p>
<p>The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format, to
use instead of the system's default certificate authority database when
authenticating clients. The default is to use</p>
<p>if it exists, otherwise the system's default certificate authority
database is used.</p>
<p>The path to the server's certificate file, in PEM format. The default
value is</p>
<p>If true, client certificates will be validated by</p>
<p>clients without a valid certificate will be unable to connect. If
false, no validation of client certificates will be performed. It true
and client certificates are created using a private certificate
authority, the</p>
<p>setting must be set to a CA bundle that contains the CA certificate
used to generate the client certificate. The default value is</p>
<p>A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.2
only, separated by a colon</p>
<p>See the</p>
<p>section in</p>
<p>for full details. The default value is</p>
<p>which consists of encryption cipher suites with key lengths larger
than 128 bits, and some cipher suites with 128-bit keys. Cipher suites
that offer no authentication are excluded.</p>
<p>A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.3
only, separated by a colon</p>
<p>Supported cipher suites depend on the version of OpenSSL used, but
should include the following:</p>
<p>The default cipher suite is</p>
<p>The path to a file containing custom Diffie-Hellman parameters in PEM
format. This file can be created with the following command:</p>
<p>openssl dhparam -out /etc/sudo_logsrvd_dhparams.pem 2048</p>
<p>By default,</p>
<p>will use the OpenSSL defaults for Diffie-Hellman key generation.</p>
<p>The path to the server's private key file, in PEM format. The default
value is</p>
<p>If true,</p>
<p>will validate its own certificate at startup time or when the
configuration is changed. If false, no verification is performed of the
server certificate. When using self-signed certificates without a
certificate authority, this setting should be set to false. The default
value is</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>section configures the optional logsrv relay host and port the server
will connect to. The TLS configuration keys are optional, by default the
corresponding keys in the</p>
<p>section will be used. They are only present in this section to make
it possible for the relay connection to use a different set of TLS
parameters from the client-facing server. The following keys are
recognized:</p>
<p>The amount of time, in seconds,</p>
<p>will wait for the connection to a</p>
<p>(see below) to complete. Once the connection is complete, the</p>
<p>setting controls the amount of time</p>
<p>will wait for the relay to respond. A value of 0 will disable the
timeout. The default value is</p>
<p>The directory in which log messages are temporarily stored before
they are sent to the relay host. Messages are stored in the wire format
specified by</p>
<p>The default value is</p>
<p>The relay host name or IP address, optional port to connect to and an
optional Transport Layer Security (TLS) flag in parentheses. The syntax
is identical to</p>
<p>in the</p>
<p>section with one exception: the wild card</p>
<p>syntax is not supported.</p>
<p>When this setting is enabled, messages from the client will be
forwarded to one of the specified relay hosts instead of being stored
locally. The</p>
<p>could be running an instance of</p>
<p>or another server that supports the</p>
<p>protocol.</p>
<p>If multiple</p>
<p>lines are specified, the first available relay host will be used.</p>
<p>The number of seconds to wait after a connection error before making
a new attempt to forward a message to a relay host. The default value
is</p>
<p>If true,</p>
<p>will store logs locally before relaying them. Once the log is
complete, a connection to the relay host is opened and the log is
relayed. If the network connection is interrupted before the log can be
fully transferred, it will be retransmitted later. The default is to
relay logs in real-time.</p>
<p>If true,</p>
<p>will enable the TCP keepalive socket option on the relay connection.
This enables the periodic transmission of keepalive messages to the
relay server. If the relay does not respond to a message in time, the
connection will be closed.</p>
<p>The amount of time, in seconds,</p>
<p>will wait for the relay server to respond after a connection has
succeeded. A value of 0 will disable the timeout. The default value
is</p>
<p>The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format, to
use instead of the system's default certificate authority database when
authenticating clients. The default is to use the value specified in
the</p>
<p>section, or the system's default certificate authority database if no
value is set.</p>
<p>The path to the server's certificate file, in PEM format. The default
is to use the value specified in the</p>
<p>section.</p>
<p>If true, the relay host's certificate will be validated by</p>
<p>connections to a relay without a valid certificate will fail. If
false, no validation of relay certificates will be performed. It true
and relay certificates are created using a private certificate
authority, the</p>
<p>setting must be set to a CA bundle that contains the CA certificate
used to generate the relay certificate. The default is to use the value
specified in the</p>
<p>section.</p>
<p>A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.2
only, separated by a colon</p>
<p>See the</p>
<p>section in</p>

format. The default is to use the value specified in the</p>
<p>section.</p>
<p>The path to the server's private key file, in PEM format. The default
is to use the value specified in the</p>
<p>section.</p>
<p>If true, the server's certificate used for relaying will be verified
at startup. If false, no verification is performed of the server
certificate. When using self-signed certificates without a certificate
authority, this setting should be set to false. The default is to use
the value specified in the</p>
<p>section.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>section configures I/O log parameters. These settings are identical
to the I/O configuration in</p>
<p>The following keys are recognized:</p>
<p>If set, I/O logs will be compressed using</p>
<p>Enabling compression can make it harder to view the logs in real-time
as the program is executing due to buffering. The default value is</p>
<p>The top-level directory to use when constructing the path name for
the I/O log directory. The session sequence number, if any, is stored in
the directory. The default value is</p>
<p>The following percent</p>
<p>escape sequences are supported:</p>
<p>expanded to a monotonically increasing base-36 sequence number, such
as 0100A5, where every two digits are used to form a new directory,
e.g.,</p>
<p>expanded to the invoking user's login name</p>
<p>expanded to the name of the invoking user's real group-ID</p>
<p>expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as
(e.g., root)</p>
<p>expanded to the group name of the user the command will be run as
(e.g., wheel)</p>
<p>expanded to the local host name without the domain name</p>
<p>expanded to the base name of the command being run</p>
<p>In addition, any escape sequences supported by the system's</p>
<p>function will be expanded.</p>
<p>To include a literal</p>
<p>character, the string</p>
<p>should be used.</p>
<p>The path name, relative to</p>
<p>in which to store I/O logs. It is possible for</p>
<p>to contain directory components. The default value is</p>
<p>See the</p>
<p>setting above for a list of supported percent</p>
<p>escape sequences.</p>
<p>In addition to the escape sequences, path names that end in six or
more</p>
<p>will have the</p>
<p>replaced with a unique combination of digits and letters, similar to
the</p>
<p>function.</p>
<p>If the path created by concatenating</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>already exists, the existing I/O log file will be truncated and
overwritten unless</p>
<p>ends in six or more</p>
<p>If set, I/O log data is flushed to disk after each write instead of
buffering it. This makes it possible to view the logs in real-time as
the program is executing but may significantly reduce the effectiveness
of I/O log compression. I/O logs are always flushed before sending a
commit point to the client regardless of this setting. The default value
is</p>
<p>The group name to look up when setting the group-ID on new I/O log
files and directories. If</p>
<p>is not set, the primary group-ID of the user specified by</p>
<p>If neither</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>are set, I/O log files and directories are created with group-ID
0.</p>
<p>The file mode to use when creating I/O log files. Mode bits for read
and write permissions for owner, group, or other are honored, everything
else is ignored. The file permissions will always include the owner read
and write bits, even if they are not present in the specified mode. When
creating I/O log directories, search (execute) bits are added to match
the read and write bits specified by</p>
<p>The default value is</p>
<p>The user name to look up when setting the owner of new I/O log files
and directories. If</p>
<p>is set, it will be used instead of the user's primary group-ID. By
default, I/O log files and directories are created with user and
group-ID 0.</p>
<p>Most programs that require a user's password will disable echo before
reading the password to avoid displaying the plaintext password on the
screen. However, if terminal input is being logged, the password will
still be present in the I/O log. If</p>
<p>is set to</p>
<p>will attempt to prevent passwords from being logged. It does this by
using the regular expressions in</p>
<p>to match a password prompt in the terminal output buffer. When a
match is found, input characters in the I/O log will be replaced
with</p>
<p>until either a line feed or carriage return is found in the terminal
input or a new terminal output buffer is received. If, however, a
program displays characters as the user types them (such as</p>
<p>when the</p>
<p>option is set), only the first character of the password will be
replaced in the I/O log. The default value is</p>
<p>The maximum sequence number that will be substituted for the</p>
<p>escape in the I/O log file (see the</p>
<p>description above for more information). While the value substituted
for</p>
<p>is in base 36,</p>
<p>itself should be expressed in decimal. Values larger than 2176782336
(which corresponds to the base 36 sequence number</p>
<p>will be silently truncated to 2176782336. The default value is</p>
<p>One or more POSIX extended regular expressions used to match password
prompts in the terminal output when</p>
<p>is disabled. As an extension, if the regular expression begins
with</p>
<p>it will be matched in a case-insensitive manner. Multiple</p>
<p>settings may be specified. Each regular expression is limited to 1024
characters. The default value is</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>section configures how (and if) security policy events are
logged.</p>
<p>Where to log accept, reject, and alert events reported by the policy.
Supported values are</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The default value is</p>
<p>If true,</p>
<p>will log an event when a command exits or is terminated by a signal.
Defaults to</p>
<p>The event log format. Supported log formats are</p>
<p>for traditional sudo-style logs and</p>
<p>for JSON-format logs. The JSON log entries contain the full contents
of the accept, reject, exit and alert messages. The default value is</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>section configures how events are logged via</p>
<p>Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging. Defaults to</p>
<p>The following syslog facilities are supported:</p>
<p>(if your OS supports it),</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Syslog priority to use when the user is allowed to run a command and
authentication is successful. Defaults to</p>
<p>The following syslog priorities are supported:</p>

servers must support messages of at least 480 bytes and should support
messages up to 2048 bytes. By default,</p>
<p>creates log messages up to 960 bytes which corresponds to the
historic</p>
<p>syslog implementation which used a 1024 byte buffer to store the
message, date, hostname, and program name.</p>
<p>To prevent syslog messages from being truncated,</p>
<p>will split up sudo-style log messages that are larger than</p>
<p>bytes. When a message is split, additional parts will include the
string</p>
<p>after the user name and before the continued command line arguments.
JSON-format log entries are never split and are not affected by</p>
<p>Syslog facility if syslog is being used for server warning messages.

<p>section consists of settings related to logging to a plain file (not
syslog).</p>
<p>The path to the file-based event log. This path must be
fully-qualified and start with a</p>
