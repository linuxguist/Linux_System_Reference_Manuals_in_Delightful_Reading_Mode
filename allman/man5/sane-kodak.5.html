<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-kodak - SANE backend for big Kodak flatbed and ADF scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-kodak</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to large Kodak flatbed
and ADF scanners.</p>
<p>This document describes backend version 7, which shipped with SANE
1.0.21.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>This version should support models which speak the Kodak SCSI and
Firewire protocols. The i1860 was used to develop the backend, but other
models may work with only minimal modifications. Please see the list at
<em>http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html</em> for an
updated list.</p>
<p>If you have a machine not on that list, or reported as 'untested':
the best way to determine level of support is to test the scanner
directly, or to collect a trace of the windows driver in action. Please
contact the author for help or with test results.</p>
<h1>UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>Most of the recent Kodak consumer or workgroup level machines are
based on other chipsets and are not supported by this backend. Some of
these scanners may be supported by another backend.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Effort has been made to expose the basic hardware options,
including:</p>
<p><strong>--source s</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selects the source for the scan. Options may include "Flatbed", "ADF
Front", "ADF Back", "ADF Duplex".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--mode m</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selects the mode for the scan. Options may include "Lineart",
"Halftone", "Gray", and "Color".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--resolution</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls scan resolution. Available choices may be limited by
mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--tl-x</strong>, <strong>--tl-y</strong>,
<strong>--br-x</strong>, <strong>--br-y</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets scan area upper left and lower right coordinates. These are
renamed <strong>-t</strong>, <strong>-l</strong>, <strong>-x</strong>,
<strong>-y</strong> by some frontends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>--page-width</strong>, <strong>--page-height</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets paper size. Used by scanner to determine centering of scan
coordinates when using the ADF (Automatic Document Feeder) and to detect
double feed errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the
scanner. Use <em>scanimage --help</em> to get a list, but be aware that
some options may be settable only when another option has been set, and
that advanced options may be hidden by some frontend programs.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILE</h1>
<p>The configuration file <em>kodak.conf</em> is used to tell the
backend how to look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the frontend asks
the backend for a list of scanners, generally only when the frontend
starts. If the configuration file is missing, the backend will use a set
of compiled defaults, which are identical to the default configuration
file shipped with SANE.</p>
<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 2 ways:</p>
<p>"scsi KODAK"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests backend to search all scsi buses in the system for a device
which reports itself to be a scanner made by 'KODAK'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"scsi /dev/sg0" (or other scsi device file)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful if you
have multiple compatible scanners connected to your system, and need to
specify one. Probably should not be used with the other "scsi" line
above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only configuration option supported is "buffer-size=xxx",
allowing you to set the number of bytes in the data buffer to something
other than the compiled-in default, 32768 (32K). Some users report that
their scanner will "hang" mid-page, or fail to transmit the image if the
buffer is not large enough.</p>
<p>Note: This option may appear multiple times in the configuration
file. It only applies to scanners discovered by 'scsi/usb' lines that
follow this option.</p>
<p>Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this value, as
some users required it to be quite large. Values above the default are
not recommended, and may crash your OS or lockup your scsi card driver.
You have been warned.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>The backend uses a single environment variable,
<strong>SANE_DEBUG_KODAK</strong>, which enables debugging output to
stderr. Valid values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Errors<br />
10 Function trace<br />
15 Function detail<br />
20 Option commands<br />
25 SCSI trace<br />
30 SCSI detail<br />
35 Useless noise</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>KNOWN ISSUES</h1>
<p>Most hardware options are either not supported or not exposed for
control by the user, including: multifeed detection, image compression,
autocropping, endorser, thresholding, multi-stream, etc.</p>
