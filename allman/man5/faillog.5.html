<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>faillog - login failure logging file</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>/var/log/faillog maintains a count of login failures and the limits
for each account.</p>
<p>The file contains fixed length records, indexed by numerical UID.
Each record contains the count of login failures since the last
successful login; the maximum number of failures before the account is
disabled; the line on which the last login failure occurred; the date of
the last login failure; and the duration (in seconds) during which the
account will be locked after a failure.</p>
<p>The structure of the file is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>struct	faillog {
	short   fail_cnt;
	short   fail_max;
	char    fail_line[12];
	time_t  fail_time;
	long    fail_locktime;
};</code></pre>
