<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>nm-settings-nmcli - Description of settings and properties of
NetworkManager connection profiles for nmcli</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>NetworkManager is based on a concept of connection profiles,
sometimes referred to as connections only. These connection profiles
contain a network configuration. When NetworkManager activates a
connection profile on a network device the configuration will be applied
and an active network connection will be established. Users are free to
create as many connection profiles as they see fit. Thus they are
flexible in having various network configurations for different
networking needs.</p>
<p>NetworkManager provides an API for configuring connection profiles,
for activating them to configure the network, and inspecting the current
network configuration. The command line tool <em>nmcli</em> is a client
application to NetworkManager that uses this API. See
<strong>nmcli</strong>(1) for details.</p>
<p>With commands like nmcli connection add, nmcli connection modify and
nmcli connection show, connection profiles can be created, modified and
inspected. A profile consists of properties. On D-Bus this follows the
format as described by <strong>nm-settings-dbus</strong>(5), while this
manual page describes the settings format how they are expected by
<em>nmcli</em>.</p>
<p>The settings and properties shown in tables below list all available
connection configuration options. However, note that not all settings
are applicable to all connection types. <em>nmcli</em> connection editor
has also a built-in <em>describe</em> command that can display
description of particular settings and properties of this page.</p>
<p>The <em>setting</em> and <em>property</em> can be abbreviated
provided they are unique. The list below also shows aliases that can be
used unqualified instead of the full name. For example
connection.interface-name and ifname refer to the same property.</p>
<h2>connection setting</h2>
<p>General Connection Profile Settings.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<p><strong>auth-retries</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of retries for the authentication. Zero means to try
indefinitely; -1 means to use a global default. If the global default is
not set, the authentication retries for 3 times before failing the
connection.</p>
<p>Currently, this only applies to 802-1x authentication.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>autoconnect</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alias: autoconnect</p>
<p>Whether or not the connection should be automatically connected by
NetworkManager when the resources for the connection are available. TRUE
to automatically activate the connection, FALSE to require manual
intervention to activate the connection.</p>
<p>Autoconnect happens when the circumstances are suitable. That means
for example that the device is currently managed and not active.
Autoconnect thus never replaces or competes with an already active
profile.</p>
<p>Note that autoconnect is not implemented for VPN profiles. See
"secondaries" as an alternative to automatically connect VPN
profiles.</p>
<p>If multiple profiles are ready to autoconnect on the same device, the
one with the better "connection.autoconnect-priority" is chosen. If the
priorities are equal, then the most recently connected profile is
activated. If the profiles were not connected earlier or their
"connection.timestamp" is identical, the choice is undefined.</p>
<p>Depending on "connection.multi-connect", a profile can (auto)connect
only once at a time or multiple times.</p>
<p>Format: boolean</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>autoconnect-priority</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The autoconnect priority in range -999 to 999. If the connection is
set to autoconnect, connections with higher priority will be preferred.
The higher number means higher priority. Defaults to 0. Note that this
property only matters if there are more than one candidate profile to
select for autoconnect. In case of equal priority, the profile used most
recently is chosen.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>autoconnect-retries</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of times a connection should be tried when autoactivating
before giving up. Zero means forever, -1 means the global default (4
times if not overridden). Setting this to 1 means to try activation only
once before blocking autoconnect. Note that after a timeout,
NetworkManager will try to autoconnect again.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>autoconnect-slaves</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not slaves of this connection should be automatically
brought up when NetworkManager activates this connection. This only has
a real effect for master connections. The properties "autoconnect",
"autoconnect-priority" and "autoconnect-retries" are unrelated to this
setting. The permitted values are: 0: leave slave connections untouched,
1: activate all the slave connections with this connection, -1: default.
If -1 (default) is set, global connection.autoconnect-slaves is read to
determine the real value. If it is default as well, this fallbacks to
0.</p>
<p>Format: NMSettingConnectionAutoconnectSlaves (int32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>dns-over-tls</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether DNSOverTls (dns-over-tls) is enabled for the connection.
DNSOverTls is a technology which uses TLS to encrypt dns traffic.</p>
<p>The permitted values are: "yes" (2) use DNSOverTls and disabled
fallback, "opportunistic" (1) use DNSOverTls but allow fallback to
unencrypted resolution, "no" (0) dont ever use DNSOverTls. If
unspecified "default" depends on the plugin used. Systemd-resolved uses
global setting.</p>
<p>This feature requires a plugin which supports DNSOverTls. Otherwise,
the setting has no effect. One such plugin is dns-systemd-resolved.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>gateway-ping-timeout</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If greater than zero, delay success of IP addressing until either the
timeout is reached, or an IP gateway replies to a ping.</p>
<p>Format: uint32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>id</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alias: con-name</p>
<p>A human readable unique identifier for the connection, like "Work
Wi-Fi" or "T-Mobile 3G".</p>
<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>interface-name</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alias: ifname</p>
<p>The name of the network interface this connection is bound to. If not
set, then the connection can be attached to any interface of the
appropriate type (subject to restrictions imposed by other
settings).</p>
<p>For software devices this specifies the name of the created
device.</p>
<p>For connection types where interface names cannot easily be made
persistent (e.g. mobile broadband or USB Ethernet), this property should
not be used. Setting this property restricts the interfaces a connection
can be used with, and if interface names change or are reordered the
connection may be applied to the wrong interface.</p>
<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>lldp</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether LLDP is enabled for the connection.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>llmnr</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is enabled for
the connection. LLMNR is a protocol based on the Domain Name System
(DNS) packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name
resolution for hosts on the same local link.</p>
<p>The permitted values are: "yes" (2) register hostname and resolving
for the connection, "no" (0) disable LLMNR for the interface, "resolve"
(1) do not register hostname but allow resolving of LLMNR host names If
unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the DNS plugin (which for
systemd-resolved currently means "yes").</p>
<p>This feature requires a plugin which supports LLMNR. Otherwise, the
setting has no effect. One such plugin is dns-systemd-resolved.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>master</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alias: master</p>
<p>Interface name of the master device or UUID of the master
connection.</p>
<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mdns</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether mDNS is enabled for the connection.</p>
<p>The permitted values are: "yes" (2) register hostname and resolving
for the connection, "no" (0) disable mDNS for the interface, "resolve"
(1) do not register hostname but allow resolving of mDNS host names and
"default" (-1) to allow lookup of a global default in
NetworkManager.conf. If unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the
DNS plugin (which for systemd-resolved currently means "no").</p>
<p>This feature requires a plugin which supports mDNS. Otherwise, the
setting has no effect. One such plugin is dns-systemd-resolved.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>metered</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the connection is metered.</p>
<p>When updating this property on a currently activated connection, the
change takes effect immediately.</p>
<p>Format: NMMetered (int32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mptcp-flags</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to configure MPTCP endpoints and the address flags. If MPTCP
is enabled in NetworkManager, it will configure the addresses of the
interface as MPTCP endpoints. Note that IPv4 loopback addresses
(127.0.0.0/8), IPv4 link local addresses (169.254.0.0/16), the IPv6
loopback address (::1), IPv6 link local addresses (fe80::/10), IPv6
unique local addresses (ULA, fc00::/7) and IPv6 privacy extension
addresses (rfc3041, ipv6.ip6-privacy) will be excluded from being
configured as endpoints.</p>
<p>If "disabled" (0x1), MPTCP handling for the interface is disabled and
no endpoints are registered.</p>
<p>The "enabled" (0x2) flag means that MPTCP handling is enabled. This
flag can also be implied from the presence of other flags.</p>
<p>Even when enabled, MPTCP handling will by default still be disabled
unless "/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled" sysctl is on. NetworkManager does
not change the sysctl and this is up to the administrator or
distribution. To configure endpoints even if the sysctl is disabled,
"also-without-sysctl" (0x4) flag can be used. In that case,
NetworkManager doesnt look at the sysctl and configures endpoints
regardless.</p>
<p>Even when enabled, NetworkManager will only configure MPTCP endpoints
for a certain address family, if there is a unicast default route
(0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) in the main routing table. The flag
"also-without-default-route" (0x8) can override that.</p>
<p>When MPTCP handling is enabled then endpoints are configured with the
specified address flags "signal" (0x10), "subflow" (0x20), "backup"
(0x40), "fullmesh" (0x80). See ip-mptcp(8) manual for additional
information about the flags.</p>
<p>If the flags are zero (0x0), the global connection default from
NetworkManager.conf is honored. If still unspecified, the fallback is
"enabled,subflow". Note that this means that MPTCP is by default done
depending on the "/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled" sysctl.</p>
<p>NetworkManager does not change the MPTCP limits nor enable MPTCP via
"/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled". That is a host configuration which the
admin can change via sysctl and ip-mptcp.</p>
<p>Strict reverse path filtering (rp_filter) breaks many MPTCP use
cases, so when MPTCP handling for IPv4 addresses on the interface is
enabled, NetworkManager would loosen the strict reverse path filtering
(1) to the loose setting (2).</p>
<p>Format: uint32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mud-url</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If configured, set to a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) URL that
points to manufacturer-recommended network policies for IoT devices. It
is transmitted as a DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 option. The value must be a valid
URL starting with "https://".</p>
<p>The special value "none" is allowed to indicate that no MUD URL is
used.</p>
<p>If the per-profile value is unspecified (the default), a global
connection default gets consulted. If still unspecified, the ultimate
default is "none".</p>
<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>multi-connect</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies whether the profile can be active multiple times at a
particular moment. The value is of type NMConnectionMultiConnect.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>permissions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An array of strings defining what access a given user has to this
connection. If this is NULL or empty, all users are allowed to access
this connection; otherwise users are allowed if and only if they are in
this list. When this is not empty, the connection can be active only
when one of the specified users is logged into an active session. Each
entry is of the form "[type]:[id]:[reserved]"; for example,
"user:dcbw:blah".</p>
<p>At this time only the "user" [type] is allowed. Any other values are
ignored and reserved for future use. [id] is the username that this
permission refers to, which may not contain the ":" character. Any
[reserved] information present must be ignored and is reserved for
future use. All of [type], [id], and [reserved] must be valid UTF-8.</p>
<p>Format: array of string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>read-only</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>FALSE if the connection can be modified using the provided settings
services D-Bus interface with the right privileges, or TRUE if the
connection is read-only and cannot be modified.</p>
<p>Format: boolean</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>secondaries</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>List of connection UUIDs that should be activated when the base
connection itself is activated. Currently, only VPN connections are
supported.</p>
<p>Format: array of string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>slave-type</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alias: slave-type</p>
<p>Setting name of the device type of this slaves master connection (eg,
"bond"), or NULL if this connection is not a slave.</p>
<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>stable-id</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This represents the identity of the connection used for various
purposes. It allows to configure multiple profiles to share the
identity. Also, the stable-id can contain placeholders that are
substituted dynamically and deterministically depending on the
context.</p>
<p>The stable-id is used for generating IPv6 stable private addresses
with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy. It is also used to seed the
generated cloned MAC address for ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable and
wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable. It is also used as DHCP client
identifier with ipv4.dhcp-client-id=stable and to derive the DHCP DUID
with ipv6.dhcp-duid=stable-[llt,ll,uuid].</p>
<p>Note that depending on the context where it is used, other parameters
are also seeded into the generation algorithm. For example, a per-host
key is commonly also included, so that different systems end up
generating different IDs. Or with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy,
also the devices name is included, so that different interfaces yield
different addresses. The per-host key is the identity of your machine
and stored in /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key. See NetworkManager(8)
manual about the secret-key and the host identity.</p>
<p>The $ character is treated special to perform dynamic substitutions
at runtime. Currently, supported are "${CONNECTION}", "${DEVICE}",
"${MAC}", "${BOOT}", "${RANDOM}". These effectively create unique IDs
per-connection, per-device, per-boot, or every time. Note that
"${DEVICE}" corresponds to the interface name of the device and "${MAC}"
is the permanent MAC address of the device. Any unrecognized patterns
following $ are treated verbatim, however are reserved for future use.
You are thus advised to avoid $ or escape it as "$$". For example, set
it to "${CONNECTION}-${BOOT}-${DEVICE}" to create a unique id for this
connection that changes with every reboot and differs depending on the
interface where the profile activates.</p>
<p>If the value is unset, a global connection default is consulted. If
the value is still unset, the default is similar to "${CONNECTION}" and
uses a unique, fixed ID for the connection.</p>
<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>timestamp</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The time, in seconds since the Unix Epoch, that the connection was
last _successfully_ fully activated.</p>
<p>NetworkManager updates the connection timestamp periodically when the
connection is active to ensure that an active connection has the latest
timestamp. The property is only meant for reading (changes to this
property will not be preserved).</p>
<p>Format: uint64</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>type</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alias: type</p>
<p>Base type of the connection. For hardware-dependent connections,
should contain the setting name of the hardware-type specific setting
(ie, "802-3-ethernet" or "802-11-wireless" or "bluetooth", etc), and for
non-hardware dependent connections like VPN or otherwise, should contain
the setting name of that setting type (ie, "vpn" or "bridge", etc).</p>
<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>uuid</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A universally unique identifier for the connection, for example
generated with libuuid. It should be assigned when the connection is
created, and never changed as long as the connection still applies to
the same network. For example, it should not be changed when the "id"
property or NMSettingIP4Config changes, but might need to be re-created
when the Wi-Fi SSID, mobile broadband network provider, or "type"
property changes.</p>
<p>The UUID must be in the format "2815492f-7e56-435e-b2e9-246bd7cdc664"
(ie, contains only hexadecimal characters and "-").</p>
<p>Format: a valid RFC4122 universally unique identifier (UUID).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>wait-activation-delay</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time in milliseconds to wait for connection to be considered
activated. The wait will start after the pre-up dispatcher event.</p>
<p>The value 0 means no wait time. The default value is -1, which
currently has the same meaning as no wait time.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>wait-device-timeout</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Timeout in milliseconds to wait for device at startup. During boot,
devices may take a while to be detected by the driver. This property
will cause to delay NetworkManager-wait-online.service and nm-online to
give the device a chance to appear. This works by waiting for the given
timeout until a compatible device for the profile is available and
managed.</p>
<p>The value 0 means no wait time. The default value is -1, which
currently has the same meaning as no wait time.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>zone</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trust level of a the connection. Free form case-insensitive
string (for example "Home", "Work", "Public"). NULL or unspecified zone
means the connection will be placed in the default zone as defined by
the firewall.</p>
<p>When updating this property on a currently activated connection, the
change takes effect immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A timeout for the authentication. Zero means the global default; if

</blockquote>
<p><strong>ca-cert</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contains the CA certificate if used by the EAP method specified in
the "eap" property.</p>
<p>Certificate data is specified using a "scheme"; three are currently
supported: blob, path and pkcs#11 URL. When using the blob scheme this
property should be set to the certificates DER encoded data. When using
the path scheme, this property should be set to the full UTF-8 encoded
path of the certificate, prefixed with the string "file://" and ending
with a terminating NUL byte. This property can be unset even if the EAP
method supports CA certificates, but this allows man-in-the-middle
attacks and is NOT recommended.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>dhcp-client-id</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string sent to the DHCP server to identify the local machine which
the DHCP server may use to customize the DHCP lease and options. When
the property is a hex string (aa:bb:cc) it is interpreted as a binary
client ID, in which case the first byte is assumed to be the type field
as per RFC 2132 section 9.14 and the remaining bytes may be an hardware
address (e.g. 01:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx where 1 is the Ethernet ARP type and
the rest is a MAC address). If the property is not a hex string it is
considered as a non-hardware-address client ID and the type field is set
to 0.</p>
<p>The special values "mac" and "perm-mac" are supported, which use the
current or permanent MAC address of the device to generate a client
identifier with type ethernet (01). Currently, these options only work
for ethernet type of links.</p>
<p>The special value "ipv6-duid" uses the DUID from "ipv6.dhcp-duid"
property as an RFC4361-compliant client identifier. As IAID it uses
"ipv4.dhcp-iaid" and falls back to "ipv6.dhcp-iaid" if unset.</p>
<p>The special value "duid" generates a RFC4361-compliant client
identifier based on "ipv4.dhcp-iaid" and uses a DUID generated by
hashing /etc/machine-id.</p>
<p>The special value "stable" is supported to generate a type 0 client
identifier based on the stable-id (see connection.stable-id) and a
per-host key. If you set the stable-id, you may want to include the
"${DEVICE}" or "${MAC}" specifier to get a per-device key.</p>

<p><strong>dhcp-hostname-flags</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flags for the DHCP hostname and FQDN.</p>
<p>Currently, this property only includes flags to control the FQDN

NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_SERV_UPDATE (0x1),
NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_ENCODED (0x2) and
NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_NO_UPDATE (0x4). When no FQDN flag is set and
NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS (0x8) is set, the DHCP FQDN
option will contain no flag. Otherwise, if no FQDN flag is set and
NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS (0x8) is not set, the standard
FQDN flags are set in the request:
NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_SERV_UPDATE (0x1),

<p>Format: uint32</p>

<p><strong>dhcp-iaid</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string containing the "Identity Association Identifier" (IAID) used
by the DHCP client. The string can be a 32-bit number (either decimal,
hexadecimal or or as colon separated hexadecimal numbers). Alternatively
it can be set to the special values "mac", "perm-mac", "ifname" or
"stable". When set to "mac" (or "perm-mac"), the last 4 bytes of the
current (or permanent) MAC address are used as IAID. When set to
"ifname", the IAID is computed by hashing the interface name. The
special value "stable" can be used to generate an IAID based on the
stable-id (see connection.stable-id), a per-host key and the interface
name. When the property is unset, the value from global configuration is
used; if no global default is set then the IAID is assumed to be
"ifname".</p>
<p>For DHCPv4, the IAID is only used with "ipv4.dhcp-client-id" values
"duid" and "ipv6-duid" to generate the client-id.</p>
<p>For DHCPv6, note that at the moment this property is only supported
by the "internal" DHCPv6 plugin. The "dhclient" DHCPv6 plugin always

<p><strong>dns-options</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Array of DNS options as described in man 5 resolv.conf.</p>
<p>NULL means that the options are unset and left at the default. In

</blockquote>
<p><strong>dns-priority</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>DNS servers priority.</p>
<p>The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting. A
lower numerical value is better (higher priority).</p>
<p>Negative values have the special effect of excluding other
configurations with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence
of at least one negative priority, only DNS servers from connections
with the lowest priority value will be used. To avoid all DNS leaks, set
the priority of the profile that should be used to the most negative
value of all active connections profiles.</p>
<p>Zero selects a globally configured default value. If the latter is
missing or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard)
and 100 for other connections.</p>
<p>Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active
connections. It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the
same connection profile.</p>
<p>When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority,
VPNs will be considered first, then devices with the best (lowest
metric) default route and then all other devices.</p>
<p>When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top
of resolv.conf. To prioritize a given server over another one within the
same connection, just specify them in the desired order. Note that
commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv.conf in the
order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list on failure.
See for example the "rotate" option of the dns-options setting. If there
are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from the devices
with that lowest priority will be considered.</p>
<p>When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or
Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd-resolved settings), each
connection is used to query domains in its search list. The search
domains determine which name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is
used to prioritize name servers based on the domain. Queries for domains
not present in any search list are routed through connections having the
~. special wildcard domain, which is added automatically to connections
with the default route (or can be added manually). When multiple
connections specify the same domain, the one with the best priority
(lowest numerical value) wins. If a sub domain is configured on another
interface it will be accepted regardless the priority, unless parent
domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes the
sub domain to be shadowed. With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS
leaks by properly configuring DNS priorities and the search domains, so
that only name servers of the desired interface are configured.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>dns-search</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>List of DNS search domains. Domains starting with a tilde (~) are
considered routing domains and are used only to decide the interface
over which a query must be forwarded; they are not used to complete
unqualified host names.</p>
<p>When using a DNS plugin that supports Conditional Forwarding or Split
DNS, then the search domains specify which name servers to query. This
makes the behavior different from running with plain /etc/resolv.conf.
For more information see also the dns-priority setting.</p>
<p>When set on a profile that also enabled DHCP, the DNS search list
received automatically (option 119 for DHCPv4 and option 24 for DHCPv6)
gets merged with the manual list. This can be prevented by setting
"ignore-auto-dns". Note that if no DNS searches are configured, the
fallback will be derived from the domain from DHCP (option 15).</p>

"never-default" is set. An alternative is to configure the default route
explicitly with a manual route and /0 as prefix length.</p>
<p>Note that the gateway usually conflicts with routing that

<p>Configure method for creating the address for use with RFC4862 IPv6
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. The permitted values are:
NM_SETTING_IP6_CONFIG_ADDR_GEN_MODE_EUI64 (0),
NM_SETTING_IP6_CONFIG_ADDR_GEN_MODE_STABLE_PRIVACY (1).
NM_SETTING_IP6_CONFIG_ADDR_GEN_MODE_DEFAULT_OR_EUI64 (2) or
NM_SETTING_IP6_CONFIG_ADDR_GEN_MODE_DEFAULT (3).</p>
<p>If the property is set to EUI64, the addresses will be generated
using the interface tokens derived from hardware address. This makes the
host part of the address to stay constant, making it possible to track
hosts presence when it changes networks. The address changes when the
interface hardware is replaced.</p>
<p>The value of stable-privacy enables use of cryptographically secure
hash of a secret host-specific key along with the connections stable-id
and the network address as specified by RFC7217. This makes it
impossible to use the address track hosts presence, and makes the
address stable when the network interface hardware is replaced.</p>
<p>The special values "default" and "default-or-eui64" will fallback to
the global connection default in as documented in NetworkManager.conf(5)
manual. If the global default is not specified, the fallback value is
"stable-privacy" or "eui64", respectively.</p>
<p>For libnm, the property defaults to "default" since 1.40. Previously
it defaulted to "stable-privacy". On D-Bus, the absence of an
addr-gen-mode setting equals "default". For keyfile plugin, the absence
of the setting on disk means "default-or-eui64" so that the property

value in the Client Identifier option.</p>
<p>The special value "lease" will retrieve the DUID previously used from
the lease file belonging to the connection. If no DUID is found and
"dhclient" is the configured dhcp client, the DUID is searched in the
system-wide dhclient lease file. If still no DUID is found, or another
dhcp client is used, a global and permanent DUID-UUID (RFC 6355) will be
generated based on the machine-id.</p>
<p>The special values "llt" and "ll" will generate a DUID of type LLT or
LL (see RFC 3315) based on the current MAC address of the device. In
order to try providing a stable DUID-LLT, the time field will contain a
constant timestamp that is used globally (for all profiles) and
persisted to disk.</p>
<p>The special values "stable-llt", "stable-ll" and "stable-uuid" will
generate a DUID of the corresponding type, derived from the connections
stable-id and a per-host unique key. You may want to include the
"${DEVICE}" or "${MAC}" specifier in the stable-id, in case this profile

it can be set to the special values "mac", "perm-mac", "ifname" or
"stable". When set to "mac" (or "perm-mac"), the last 4 bytes of the

<p><strong>dns-priority</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>DNS servers priority.</p>
<p>The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting. A
lower numerical value is better (higher priority).</p>
<p>Negative values have the special effect of excluding other
configurations with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence
of at least one negative priority, only DNS servers from connections
with the lowest priority value will be used. To avoid all DNS leaks, set
the priority of the profile that should be used to the most negative
value of all active connections profiles.</p>
<p>Zero selects a globally configured default value. If the latter is
missing or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard)
and 100 for other connections.</p>
<p>Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active
connections. It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the
same connection profile.</p>
<p>When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority,
VPNs will be considered first, then devices with the best (lowest
metric) default route and then all other devices.</p>
<p>When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top
of resolv.conf. To prioritize a given server over another one within the
same connection, just specify them in the desired order. Note that
commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv.conf in the
order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list on failure.
See for example the "rotate" option of the dns-options setting. If there
are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from the devices
with that lowest priority will be considered.</p>
<p>When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or
Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd-resolved settings), each
connection is used to query domains in its search list. The search
domains determine which name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is
used to prioritize name servers based on the domain. Queries for domains
not present in any search list are routed through connections having the
~. special wildcard domain, which is added automatically to connections
with the default route (or can be added manually). When multiple
connections specify the same domain, the one with the best priority
(lowest numerical value) wins. If a sub domain is configured on another
interface it will be accepted regardless the priority, unless parent
domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes the
sub domain to be shadowed. With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS
leaks by properly configuring DNS priorities and the search domains, so
that only name servers of the desired interface are configured.</p>

<p><strong>dns-search</strong></p>

<p>List of DNS search domains. Domains starting with a tilde (~) are

<p>When using a DNS plugin that supports Conditional Forwarding or Split
DNS, then the search domains specify which name servers to query. This
makes the behavior different from running with plain /etc/resolv.conf.
For more information see also the dns-priority setting.</p>
<p>When set on a profile that also enabled DHCP, the DNS search list
received automatically (option 119 for DHCPv4 and option 24 for DHCPv6)

SLAAC, default-routes and static routes. But note that static routes can
individually overwrite the setting by explicitly specifying a non-zero
routing table.</p>
<p>If the table setting is left at zero, it is eligible to be
overwritten via global configuration. If the property is zero even after
applying the global configuration value, policy routing is disabled for
the address family of this connection.</p>
<p>Policy routing disabled means that NetworkManager will add all routes
to the main table (except static routes that explicitly configure a
different table). Additionally, NetworkManager will not delete any
extraneous routes from tables except the main table. This is to preserve
backward compatibility for users who manage routing tables outside of
NetworkManager.</p>

<p>Format: array of string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>interface-name</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of interface names to match. Each element is a shell wildcard
pattern.</p>
<p>An element can be prefixed with a pipe symbol (|) or an ampersand
(&amp;). The former means that the element is optional and the latter
means that it is mandatory. If there are any optional elements, than the
match evaluates to true if at least one of the optional element matches
(logical OR). If there are any mandatory elements, then they all must
match (logical AND). By default, an element is optional. This means that
an element "foo" behaves the same as "|foo". An element can also be
inverted with exclamation mark (!) between the pipe symbol (or the
ampersand) and before the pattern. Note that "!foo" is a shortcut for
the mandatory match "&amp;!foo". Finally, a backslash can be used at the
beginning of the element (after the optional special characters) to
escape the start of the pattern. For example, "&amp;\\!a" is an
mandatory match for literally "!a".</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>kernel-command-line</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of kernel command line arguments to match. This may be used to
check whether a specific kernel command line option is set (or unset, if
prefixed with the exclamation mark). The argument must either be a
single word, or an assignment (i.e. two words, joined by "="). In the
former case the kernel command line is searched for the word appearing
as is, or as left hand side of an assignment. In the latter case, the
exact assignment is looked for with right and left hand side matching.
Wildcard patterns are not supported.</p>
<p>See NMSettingMatch:interface-name for how special characters |,
&amp;, ! and \\ are used for optional and mandatory matches and
inverting the match.</p>

<p><strong>path</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of paths to match against the ID_PATH udev property of
devices. ID_PATH represents the topological persistent path of a device.
It typically contains a subsystem string (pci, usb, platform, etc.) and
a subsystem-specific identifier.</p>
<p>For PCI devices the path has the form
"pci-$domain:$bus:$device.$function", where each variable is an
hexadecimal value; for example "pci-0000:0a:00.0".</p>
<p>The path of a device can be obtained with "udevadm info
/sys/class/net/$dev | grep ID_PATH=" or by looking at the "path"
property exported by NetworkManager ("nmcli -f general.path device show
$dev").</p>
<p>Each element of the list is a shell wildcard pattern.</p>

<h2>tc setting</h2>
<p>Linux Traffic Control Settings.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<p><strong>qdiscs</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Array of TC queueing disciplines. qdisc is a basic block in the Linux
traffic control subsystem</p>
<p>Each qdisc can be specified by the following attributes:</p>
<p><em>handle HANDLE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifies the qdisc handle. A qdisc, which potentially can have
children, gets assigned a major number, called a handle, leaving the
minor number namespace available for classes. The handle is expressed as
10:. It is customary to explicitly assign a handle to qdiscs expected to
have children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>parent HANDLE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifies the handle of the parent qdisc the current qdisc must be
attached to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>root</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifies that the qdisc is attached to the root of device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>KIND</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is the qdisc kind. NetworkManager currently supports the
following kinds: fq_codel, sfq, tbf. Each qdisc kind has a different set
of parameters, described below. There are also some kinds like pfifo,
pfifo_fast, prio supported by NetworkManager but their parameters are
not supported by NetworkManager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parameters for fq_codel:</p>
<p><em>limit U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the hard limit on the real queue size. When this limit is reached,
incoming packets are dropped. Default is 10240 packets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>memory_limit U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>sets a limit on the total number of bytes that can be queued in this
FQ-CoDel instance. The lower of the packet limit of the limit parameter
and the memory limit will be enforced. Default is 32 MB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>flows U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the number of flows into which the incoming packets are classified.
Due to the stochastic nature of hashing, multiple flows may end up being
hashed into the same slot. Newer flows have priority over older ones.
This parameter can be set only at load time since memory has to be
allocated for the hash table. Default value is 1024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>target U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the acceptable minimum standing/persistent queue delay. This minimum
delay is identified by tracking the local minimum queue delay that
packets experience. The unit of measurement is microsecond(us). Default
value is 5ms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>interval U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>used to ensure that the measured minimum delay does not become too
stale. The minimum delay must be experienced in the last epoch of length
.B interval. It should be set on the order of the worst-case RTT through
the bottleneck to give endpoints sufficient time to react. Default value
is 100ms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>quantum U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the number of bytes used as deficit in the fair queuing algorithm.
Default is set to 1514 bytes which corresponds to the Ethernet MTU plus
the hardware header length of 14 bytes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ecn BOOL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>can be used to mark packets instead of dropping them. ecn is turned
on by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ce_threshold U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>sets a threshold above which all packets are marked with ECN
Congestion Experienced. This is useful for DCTCP-style congestion
control algorithms that require marking at very shallow queueing
thresholds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parameters for sfq:</p>
<p><em>divisor U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>can be used to set a different hash table size, available from kernel
2.6.39 onwards. The specified divisor must be a power of two and cannot
be larger than 65536. Default value: 1024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>limit U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upper limit of the SFQ. Can be used to reduce the default length of
127 packets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>depth U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit of packets per flow. Default to 127 and can be lowered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>perturb_period U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interval in seconds for queue algorithm perturbation. Defaults to 0,
which means that no perturbation occurs. Do not set too low for each
perturbation may cause some packet reordering or losses. Advised value:
60 This value has no effect when external flow classification is used.
Its better to increase divisor value to lower risk of hash
collisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>quantum U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amount of bytes a flow is allowed to dequeue during a round of the
round robin process. Defaults to the MTU of the interface which is also
the advised value and the minimum value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>flows U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Default value is 127.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parameters for tbf:</p>
<p><em>rate U64</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bandwidth or rate. These parameters accept a floating point number,
possibly followed by either a unit (both SI and IEC units supported), or
a float followed by a percent character to specify the rate as a
percentage of the devices speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>burst U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also known as buffer or maxburst. Size of the bucket, in bytes. This
is the maximum amount of bytes that tokens can be available for
instantaneously. In general, larger shaping rates require a larger
buffer. For 10mbit/s on Intel, you need at least 10kbyte buffer if you
want to reach your configured rate!</p>
<p>If your buffer is too small, packets may be dropped because more
tokens arrive per timer tick than fit in your bucket. The minimum buffer
size can be calculated by dividing the rate by HZ.</p>
<p>Token usage calculations are performed using a table which by default
has a resolution of 8 packets. This resolution can be changed by
specifying the cell size with the burst. For example, to specify a 6000
byte buffer with a 16 byte cell size, set a burst of 6000/16. You will
probably never have to set this. Must be an integral power of 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>limit U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit is the number of bytes that can be queued waiting for tokens to
become available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>latency U32</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifies the maximum amount of time a packet can sit in the TBF. The
latency calculation takes into account the size of the bucket, the rate
and possibly the peakrate (if set). The latency and limit are mutually
exclusive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Format: GPtrArray(NMTCQdisc)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tfilters</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Array of TC traffic filters. Traffic control can manage the packet
content during classification by using filters.</p>
<p>Each tfilters can be specified by the following attributes:</p>
<p><em>handle HANDLE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifies the tfilters handle. A filter is used by a classful qdisc
to determine in which class a packet will be enqueued. It is important
to notice that filters reside within qdiscs. Therefore, see qdiscs
handle for detailed information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>parent HANDLE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifies the handle of the parent qdisc the current qdisc must be
attached to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>root</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifies that the qdisc is attached to the root of device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>KIND</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is the tfilters kind. NetworkManager currently supports
following kinds: mirred, simple. Each filter kind has a different set of
actions, described below. There are also some other kinds like matchall,
basic, u32 supported by NetworkManager.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>egress bool</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define whether the packet should exit from the interface.</p>

<p>Format: string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>generate-mac-address-mask</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With "cloned-mac-address" setting "random" or "stable", by default
all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally-administered,
unicast MAC address is created. This property allows to specify that
certain bits are fixed. Note that the least significant bit of the first
MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address.</p>
<p>If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a
default connection setting. If the value is still NULL or an empty
string, the default is to create a locally-administered, unicast MAC
address.</p>
<p>If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask.
The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address
of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization.
Setting "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC
address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the "random" or
"stable" algorithm.</p>
<p>If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this
address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that
shall not be randomized. For example, a value of "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00
68:F7:28:00:00:00" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28,
while the lower bits are randomized. A value of "02:00:00:00:00:00
00:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled globally-administered,
burned-in MAC address.</p>
<p>If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of
them is chosen randomly. For example, "02:00:00:00:00:00
00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled MAC

<p>Format: uint32</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ip4-auto-default-route</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to enable special handling of the IPv4 default route. If
enabled, the IPv4 default route from wireguard.peer-routes will be
placed to a dedicated routing-table and two policy routing rules will be
added. The fwmark number is also used as routing-table for the
default-route, and if fwmark is zero, an unused fwmark/table is chosen
automatically. This corresponds to what wg-quick does with Table=auto
and what WireGuard calls "Improved Rule-based Routing".</p>
<p>Note that for this automatism to work, you usually dont want to set
ipv4.gateway, because that will result in a conflicting default
route.</p>
<p>Leaving this at the default will enable this option automatically if
ipv4.never-default is not set and there are any peers that use a
default-route as allowed-ips. Since this automatism only makes sense if

<h2>hostname setting</h2>
<p>Hostname settings.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<p><strong>from-dhcp</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the system hostname can be determined from DHCP on this
connection.</p>
<p>When set to NM_TERNARY_DEFAULT (-1), the value from global
configuration is used. If the property doesnt have a value in the global
configuration, NetworkManager assumes the value to be NM_TERNARY_TRUE
(1).</p>
<p>Format: NMTernary (int32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>from-dns-lookup</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the system hostname can be determined from reverse DNS lookup
of addresses on this device.</p>
<p>When set to NM_TERNARY_DEFAULT (-1), the value from global
configuration is used. If the property doesnt have a value in the global
configuration, NetworkManager assumes the value to be NM_TERNARY_TRUE
(1).</p>
<p>Format: NMTernary (int32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>only-from-default</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to NM_TERNARY_TRUE (1), NetworkManager attempts to get the
hostname via DHCPv4/DHCPv6 or reverse DNS lookup on this device only
when the device has the default route for the given address family
(IPv4/IPv6).</p>
<p>If set to NM_TERNARY_FALSE (0), the hostname can be set from this
device even if it doesnt have the default route.</p>
<p>When set to NM_TERNARY_DEFAULT (-1), the value from global
configuration is used. If the property doesnt have a value in the global
configuration, NetworkManager assumes the value to be NM_TERNARY_FALSE
(0).</p>
<p>Format: NMTernary (int32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>priority</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relative priority of this connection to determine the system
hostname. A lower numerical value is better (higher priority). A
connection with higher priority is considered before connections with
lower priority.</p>
<p>If the value is zero, it can be overridden by a global value from
NetworkManager configuration. If the property doesnt have a value in the
global configuration, the value is assumed to be 100.</p>
<p>Negative values have the special effect of excluding other
connections with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of
at least one negative priority, only connections with the lowest
priority value will be used to determine the hostname.</p>
<p>Format: int32</p>

<h2>loopback setting</h2>
<p>Loopback Link Settings.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<p><strong>mtu</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<h2>Secret flag types:</h2>
<p>Each password or secret property in a setting has an associated
<em>flags</em> property that describes how to handle that secret. The
<em>flags</em> property is a bitfield that contains zero or more of the
following values logically OR-ed together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>0x0 (none) - the system is responsible for providing and storing this
secret. This may be required so that secrets are already available
before the user logs in. It also commonly means that the secret will be
stored in plain text on disk, accessible to root only. For example via
the keyfile settings plugin as described in the "PLUGINS" section in
<strong>NetworkManager.conf</strong>(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>0x1 (agent-owned) - a user-session secret agent is responsible for
providing and storing this secret; when it is required, agents will be
asked to provide it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>0x2 (not-saved) - this secret should not be saved but should be
requested from the user each time it is required. This flag should be
used for One-Time-Pad secrets, PIN codes from hardware tokens, or if the
user simply does not want to save the secret.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>0x4 (not-required) - in some situations it cannot be automatically
determined that a secret is required or not. This flag hints that the
secret is not required and should not be requested from the user.</p>
