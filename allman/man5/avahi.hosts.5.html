<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>avahi.hosts - avahi-daemon static host name file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>/etc/avahi/hosts</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>/etc/avahi/hosts</em> is a file which may be used to define
static host name to IP address mappings for multicast DNS. This is
especially useful when publishing DNS-SD services on behalf of other
hosts. See <strong>avahi.service(5)</strong> for more information.</p>
<p>The file format is similar to the one of <em>/etc/hosts</em>: on each
line an IP address and the corresponding host name. The host names
should be in FQDN form, i.e. with appended .local suffix.</p>
