<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>libaudit.conf - libaudit configuration file</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The file <em>/etc/libaudit.conf</em> contains configuration
information for user space applications that link to libaudit. The
applications are responsible for querying the settings in this file and
obeying the admin's preferences. This file contains one configuration
keyword per line, an equal sign, and then followed by appropriate
configuration information. The keywords recognized are:
<em>failure_action</em>". These keywords are described below.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>failure_action</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This keyword specifies what action the admin wishes a user space
application to take when there is a failure to send an audit event to
the kernel. The possible values are: <em>IGNORE</em> - meaning do
nothing, <em>LOG</em> - write to syslog the inability to send an audit
event, and <em>TERMINATE</em> - the user space application should
exit.</p>
</dd>
