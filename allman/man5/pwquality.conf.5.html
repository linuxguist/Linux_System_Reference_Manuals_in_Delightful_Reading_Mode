<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pwquality.conf - configuration for the libpwquality library</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</em></p>
<p><em>/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>pwquality.conf</strong> provides a way to configure the
default password quality requirements for the system passwords. This
file is read by the libpwquality library and utilities that use this
library for checking and generating passwords.</p>
<p>The file has a very simple <em>name = value</em> format with possible
comments starting with <code>#</code> character. The whitespace at the
beginning of line, end of line, and around the <code>=</code> sign is
ignored.</p>
<p>The libpwquality library also first reads all <em>*.conf</em> files
from the <em>/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d</em> directory in ASCII
sorted order. The values of the same settings are overridden in the
order the files are parsed.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The possible options in the file are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>difok</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in
the old password. (default 1) The special value of 0 disables all checks
of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new
password being exactly the same as the old one.</p>
</dd>
<dt>minlen</dt>
<dd>
<p>Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are
not disabled which is the default). (See
<strong>pam_pwquality</strong> (8).) Cannot be set to lower value than
6. (default 8)</p>
</dd>
<dt>dcredit</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less
than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default
0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>ucredit</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new
password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase
characters in the new password. (default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>lcredit</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new
password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase
characters in the new password. (default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>ocredit</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password.
If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new
password. (default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>minclass</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new
password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>maxrepeat</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new
password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>maxsequence</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new
password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that
most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the
sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if
the value is 0. (default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>maxclassrepeat</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same
class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0.
(default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>gecoscheck</dt>
<dd>
<p>If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the
<em>GECOS</em> field of the user's <strong>passwd</strong> (5) entry are
contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0.
(default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>dictcheck</dt>
<dd>
<p>If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications)
matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is
performed using the cracklib library. (default 1)</p>
</dd>
<dt>usercheck=N</dt>
<dd>
<p>If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications)
contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names
shorter than 3 characters. (default 1)</p>
</dd>
<dt>usersubstr=N</dt>
<dd>
<p>If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check
whether the password contains a substring of at least <em>N</em> length
in some form. (default 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>enforcing=N</dt>
<dd>
<p>If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise
only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality
module and possibly other applications that explicitly change their
behavior based on it. It does not affect <strong>pwmake</strong> (1) and
<strong>pwscore</strong> (1). (default 1)</p>
</dd>
<dt>badwords</dt>
<dd>
<p>Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the
password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check.
This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check
for user accounts that are not created yet.</p>
</dd>
<dt>dictpath</dt>
<dd>
<p>Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib
default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>retry=N</dt>
<dd>
<p>Prompt user at most <em>N</em> times before returning with error. The
default is <em>1</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>enforce_for_root</dt>
<dd>
<p>The module will return error on failed check even if the user
changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means
that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can
change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old
password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not
performed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>local_users_only</dt>
<dd>
<p>The module will not test the password quality for users that are not
present in the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file. The module still asks for the
password so the following modules in the stack can use the
<strong>use_authtok</strong> option. This option is off by default.</p>
