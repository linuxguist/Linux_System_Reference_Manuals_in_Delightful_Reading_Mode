<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>namespace.conf - the namespace configuration file</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>pam_namespace.so</em> module allows setup of private
namespaces with polyinstantiated directories. Directories can be
polyinstantiated based on user name or, in the case of SELinux, user
name, sensitivity level or complete security context. If an executable
script /etc/security/namespace.init exists, it is used to initialize the
namespace every time an instance directory is set up and mounted. The
script receives the polyinstantiated directory path and the instance
directory path as its arguments.</p>
<p>The /etc/security/namespace.conf file specifies which directories are
polyinstantiated, how they are polyinstantiated, how instance
directories would be named, and any users for whom polyinstantiation
would not be performed.</p>
<p>When someone logs in, the file namespace.conf is scanned. Comments
are marked by <em>#</em> characters. Each non comment line represents
one polyinstantiated directory. The fields are separated by spaces but
can be quoted by <em>"</em> characters also escape sequences
<em>\b</em>, <em>\n</em>, and <em>\t</em> are recognized. The fields are
as follows:</p>
<p><em>polydir</em> <em>instance_prefix</em> <em>method</em>
<em>list_of_uids</em></p>
<p>The first field, <em>polydir</em>, is the absolute pathname of the
directory to polyinstantiate. The special string <em>$HOME</em> is
replaced with the users home directory, and <em>$USER</em> with the
username. This field cannot be blank.</p>
<p>The second field, <em>instance_prefix</em> is the string prefix used
to build the pathname for the instantiation of &lt;polydir&gt;.
Depending on the polyinstantiation <em>method</em> it is then appended
with "instance differentiation string" to generate the final instance
directory path. This directory is created if it did not exist already,
and is then bind mounted on the &lt;polydir&gt; to provide an instance
of &lt;polydir&gt; based on the &lt;method&gt; column. The special
string <em>$HOME</em> is replaced with the users home directory, and
<em>$USER</em> with the username. This field cannot be blank.</p>
<p>The third field, <em>method</em>, is the method used for
polyinstantiation. It can take these values; "user" for
polyinstantiation based on user name, "level" for polyinstantiation
based on process MLS level and user name, "context" for
polyinstantiation based on process security context and user name,
"tmpfs" for mounting tmpfs filesystem as an instance dir, and "tmpdir"
for creating temporary directory as an instance dir which is removed
when the users session is closed. Methods "context" and "level" are only
available with SELinux. This field cannot be blank.</p>
<p>The fourth field, <em>list_of_uids</em>, is a comma separated list of
user names for whom the polyinstantiation is not performed. If left
blank, polyinstantiation will be performed for all users. If the list is
preceded with a single "~" character, polyinstantiation is performed
only for users in the list.</p>
<p>The <em>method</em> field can contain also following optional flags
separated by <em>:</em> characters.</p>
<p><em>create</em>=<em>mode</em>,<em>owner</em>,<em>group</em> - create
the polyinstantiated directory. The mode, owner and group parameters are
optional. The default for mode is determined by umask, the default owner
is the user whose session is opened, the default group is the primary
group of the user.</p>
<p><em>iscript</em>=<em>path</em> - path to the instance directory init
script. The base directory for relative paths is
/etc/security/namespace.d.</p>
<p><em>noinit</em> - instance directory init script will not be
executed.</p>
<p><em>shared</em> - the instance directories for "context" and "level"
methods will not contain the user name and will be shared among all
users.</p>
<p><em>mntopts</em>=<em>value</em> - value of this flag is passed to the
mount call when the tmpfs mount is done. It allows for example the
specification of the maximum size of the tmpfs instance that is created
by the mount call. In addition to options specified in the
<strong>tmpfs</strong>(5) manual the <em>nosuid</em>, <em>noexec</em>,
and <em>nodev</em> flags can be used to respectively disable setuid bit
effect, disable running executables, and disable devices to be
interpreted on the mounted tmpfs filesystem.</p>
<p>The directory where polyinstantiated instances are to be created,
must exist and must have, by default, the mode of 0000. The requirement
that the instance parent be of mode 0000 can be overridden with the
command line option <em>ignore_instance_parent_mode</em></p>
<p>In case of context or level polyinstantiation the SELinux context
which is used for polyinstantiation is the context used for executing a
new process as obtained by getexeccon. This context must be set by the
calling application or pam_selinux.so module. If this context is not set
the polyinstatiation will be based just on user name.</p>
<p>The "instance differentiation string" is &lt;user name&gt; for "user"
method and &lt;user name&gt;_&lt;raw directory context&gt; for "context"
and "level" methods. If the whole string is too long the end of it is
replaced with md5sum of itself. Also when command line option
<em>gen_hash</em> is used the whole string is replaced with md5sum of
itself.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>These are some example lines which might be specified in
/etc/security/namespace.conf.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>      # The following three lines will polyinstantiate /tmp,
      # /var/tmp and users home directories. /tmp and /var/tmp
      # will be polyinstantiated based on the security level
      # as well as user name, whereas home directory will be
      # polyinstantiated based on the full security context and user name.
      # Polyinstantiation will not be performed for user root
      # and adm for directories /tmp and /var/tmp, whereas home
      # directories will be polyinstantiated for all users.
      #
      # Note that instance directories do not have to reside inside
      # the polyinstantiated directory. In the examples below,
      # instances of /tmp will be created in /tmp-inst directory,
      # where as instances of /var/tmp and users home directories
      # will reside within the directories that are being
      # polyinstantiated.
      #
      /tmp     /tmp-inst/               level      root,adm
      /var/tmp /var/tmp/tmp-inst/   	level      root,adm
      $HOME    $HOME/$USER.inst/inst- context
    </code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>For the &lt;service&gt;s you need polyinstantiation (login for
example) put the following line in /etc/pam.d/&lt;service&gt; as the
last line for session group:</p>
<p>session required pam_namespace.so [arguments]</p>
<p>This module also depends on pam_selinux.so setting the context.</p>
