<p>Starting with version 1.9.0,</p>
<p>supports sending event and I/O logs to a log server. The protocol
used is written in Google's Protocol Buffers domain specific language.
The</p>
<p>section includes a complete description of the protocol in Protocol
Buffers format.</p>
<p>Because there is no way to determine message boundaries when using
Protocol Buffers, the wire size of each message is sent immediately
preceding the message itself as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network
byte order. This is referred to as</p>
<p>and is how Google suggests handling the lack of message
delimiters.</p>
<p>The protocol is made up of two basic messages,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>described below. The server must accept messages up to two megabytes
in size. The server may return an error if the client tries to send a
message larger than two megabytes.</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>is a container used to encapsulate all the possible message types a
client may send to the server.</p>
<p>message ClientMessage { oneof type { AcceptMessage accept_msg = 1;
RejectMessage reject_msg = 2; ExitMessage exit_msg = 3; RestartMessage
restart_msg = 4; AlertMessage alert_msg = 5; IoBuffer ttyin_buf = 6;
IoBuffer ttyout_buf = 7; IoBuffer stdin_buf = 8; IoBuffer stdout_buf =
9; IoBuffer stderr_buf = 10; ChangeWindowSize winsize_event = 11;
CommandSuspend suspend_event = 12; ClientHello hello_msg = 13; } }</p>
<p>The different</p>
<p>sub-messages the client may sent to the server are described
below.</p>
<p>message TimeSpec { int64 tv_sec = 1; int32 tv_nsec = 2; }</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>is the equivalent of a POSIX</p>
<p>containing seconds and nanoseconds members. The</p>
<p>member is a 64-bit integer to support dates after the year 2038.</p>
<p>message InfoMessage { message StringList { repeated string strings =
1; } message NumberList { repeated int64 numbers = 1; } string key = 1;
oneof value { int64 numval = 2; string strval = 3; StringList strlistval
= 4; NumberList numlistval = 5; } }</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>is used to represent information about the invoking user as well as
the execution environment the command runs in the form of key-value
pairs. The key is always a string but the value may be a 64-bit integer,
a string, an array of strings, or an array of 64-bit integers. The event
log data is composed of</p>
<p>entries. See the</p>
<p>section for more information.</p>
<p>message ClientHello { string client_id = 1; }</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>message consists of client information that may be sent to the server
when the client first connects.</p>
<p>A free-form client description. This usually includes the name and
version of the client implementation.</p>
<p>message AcceptMessage { TimeSpec submit_time = 1; repeated
InfoMessage info_msgs = 2; bool expect_iobufs = 3; }</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>is sent by the client when a command is allowed by the security
policy. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>The wall clock time when the command was submitted to the security
policy.</p>
<p>An array of</p>
<p>describing the user who submitted the command as well as the
execution environment of the command. This information is used to
generate an event log entry and may also be used by server to determine
where and how the I/O log is stored.</p>
<p>Set to true if the server should expect</p>
<p>messages to follow (for I/O logging) or false if the server should
only store the event log.</p>
<p>If an</p>
<p>is sent, the client must not send a</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>message RejectMessage { TimeSpec submit_time = 1; string reason = 2;
repeated InfoMessage info_msgs = 3; }</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>is sent by the client when a command is denied by the security
policy. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>The wall clock time when the command was submitted to the security
policy.</p>
<p>The reason the security policy gave for denying the command.</p>
<p>An array of</p>
<p>describing the user who submitted the command as well as the
execution environment of the command. This information is used to
generate an event log entry.</p>
<p>If a</p>
<p>is sent, the client must not send an</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>message ExitMessage { TimeSpec run_time = 1; int32 exit_value = 2;
bool dumped_core = 3; string signal = 4; string error = 5; }</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>is sent by the client after the command has exited or has been
terminated by a signal. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>The total amount of elapsed time since the command started,
calculated using a monotonic clock where possible. This is not the wall
clock time.</p>
<p>The command's exit value in the range 0-255.</p>
<p>True if the command was terminated by a signal and dumped core.</p>
<p>If the command was terminated by a signal, this is set to the name of
the signal without the leading</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>A message from the client indicating that the command was terminated
unexpectedly due to an error.</p>
<p>When performing I/O logging, the client should wait for a</p>
<p>corresponding to the final</p>
<p>before closing the connection unless the final</p>
<p>has already been received.</p>
<p>message RestartMessage { string log_id = 1; TimeSpec resume_point =
2; }</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>is sent by the client to resume sending an existing I/O log that was
previously interrupted. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>The the server-side name for an I/O log that was previously sent to
the client by the server. This may be a path name on the server or some
other kind of server-side identifier.</p>
<p>The point in time after which to resume the I/O log. This is in the
form of a</p>
<p>representing the amount of time since the command started, not the
wall clock time. The</p>
<p>should correspond to a</p>
<p>previously sent to the client by the server. If the server receives
a</p>
<p>containing a</p>
<p>it has not previously seen, an error will be returned to the client
and the connection will be dropped.</p>
<p>If a</p>
<p>is sent, the client must not send an</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>message AlertMessage { TimeSpec alert_time = 1; string reason = 2;
repeated InfoMessage info_msgs = 3; }</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>is sent by the client to indicate a problem detected by the security
policy while the command is running that should be stored in the event
log. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>The wall clock time when the alert occurred.</p>
<p>The reason for the alert.</p>
<p>An optional array of</p>
<p>describing the user who submitted the command as well as the
execution environment of the command. This information is used to
generate an event log entry.</p>
<p>message IoBuffer { TimeSpec delay = 1; bytes data = 2; }</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>is used to represent data from terminal input, terminal output,
standard input, standard output, or standard error. It contains the
following members:</p>
<p>The elapsed time since the last record in the form of a</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>should be calculated using a monotonic clock where possible.</p>
<p>The binary I/O log data from terminal input, terminal output,
standard input, standard output, or standard error.</p>
<p>message ChangeWindowSize { TimeSpec delay = 1; int32 rows = 2; int32
cols = 3; }</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>message is sent by the client when the terminal running the command
changes size. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>The elapsed time since the last record in the form of a</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>should be calculated using a monotonic clock where possible.</p>
<p>The new number of terminal rows.</p>
<p>The new number of terminal columns.</p>
<p>message CommandSuspend { TimeSpec delay = 1; string signal = 2; }</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>message is sent by the client when the command is either suspended or
resumed. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>The elapsed time since the last record in the form of a</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>should be calculated using a monotonic clock where possible.</p>
<p>The signal name without the leading</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>is a container used to encapsulate all the possible message types the
server may send to a client.</p>
<p>message ServerMessage { oneof type { ServerHello hello = 1; TimeSpec
commit_point = 2; string log_id = 3; string error = 4; string abort = 5;
} }</p>
<p>The different</p>
<p>sub-messages the server may sent to the client are described
below.</p>
<p>message ServerHello { string server_id = 1; string redirect = 2;
repeated string servers = 3; bool subcommands = 4; }</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>message consists of server information sent when the client first
connects. It contains the following members:</p>
<p>A free-form server description. Usually this includes the name and
version of the implementation running on the log server. This member is
always present.</p>
<p>A host and port separated by a colon</p>
<p>that the client should connect to instead. The host may be a host
name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address in square brackets. This may
be used for server load balancing. The server will disconnect after
sending the</p>
<p>when it includes a</p>
<p>A list of other known log servers. This can be used to implement log
server redundancy and allows the client to discover all other log
servers simply by connecting to one known server. This member may be
omitted when there is only a single log server.</p>
<p>If set, the server supports logging additional commands during a
session. The client may send an</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>is running in</p>
<p>mode. In this mode, commands spawned from the initial command
authorized by</p>
<p>are subject to policy restrictions and/or are logged. If</p>
<p>is false, the client must not attempt to log additional commands.</p>
<p>A periodic time stamp sent by the server to indicate when I/O log
buffers have been committed to storage. This message is not sent after
every</p>
<p>but rather at a server-configurable interval. When the server
receives an</p>
<p>it will respond with a</p>
<p>corresponding to the last received</p>
<p>before closing the connection.</p>
<p>The server-side ID of the I/O log being stored, sent in response to
an</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>is true.</p>
<p>A fatal server-side error. The server will close the connection after
sending the</p>
<p>message.</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>message from the server indicates that the client should kill the
command and terminate the session. It may be used to implement simple
server-side policy. The server will close the connection after sending
the</p>
<p>message.</p>
<p>The expected protocol flow is as follows:</p>
<p>Client connects to the first available server. If the client is
configured to use TLS, a TLS handshake will be attempted.</p>
<p>Client sends</p>
<p>This is currently optional but allows the server to detect a non-TLS
connection on the TLS port.</p>
<p>Server sends</p>
<p>Client responds with either</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>If client sent a</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>set, server creates a new I/O log and responds with a</p>
<p>Client sends zero or more</p>
<p>messages.</p>
<p>Server periodically responds to</p>
<p>messages with a</p>
<p>Client sends an</p>
<p>when the command exits or is killed.</p>
<p>Server sends the final</p>
<p>if one is pending.</p>
<p>Server closes the connection. After receiving the final</p>
<p>the client shuts down its side of the TLS connection if TLS is in
use, and closes the connection.</p>
<p>Server shuts down its side of the TLS connection if TLS is in use,
and closes the connection.</p>
<p>At any point, the server may send an</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>message to the client at which point the server will close the
connection. If an</p>
<p>message is received, the client should terminate the running
command.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>classes contain an array of</p>
<p>that should contain information about the user who submitted the
command as well as information about the execution environment of the
command if it was accepted.</p>
<p>Some variables have a</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>prefix. These prefixes are used to eliminate ambiguity for variables
that could apply to the client program, the user submitting the command,
or the command being run. Variables with a</p>
<p>prefix pertain to the program performing the connection to the log
server, for example</p>
<p>Variables with a</p>
<p>prefix pertain to the command that the user requested be run.
Variables with a</p>
<p>prefix pertain to the user submitting the request</p>
<p>The following</p>
<p>entries are required:</p>
<p>The following</p>
<p>entries are recognized, but not required:</p>
<p>The server must accept other variables not listed above but may
ignore them.</p>
