<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-agfafocus - SANE backend for AGFA Focus flatbed scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-agfafocus</strong> library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to AGFA Focus
flatbed scanners. At present, the following scanners are supported from
this backend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AGFA Focus GS Scanner (6 bit gray scale) (untested)<br />
AGFA Focus Lineart Scanner (lineart) (untested)<br />
AGFA Focus II (8 bit gray scale) (untested)<br />
AGFA Focus Color (24 bit color 3-pass)<br />
AGFA Focus Color Plus (24 bit color 3-pass)<br />
</p>
<p>Siemens S9036 (8 bit gray scale) (untested)<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The driver supports line art, 6bpp and 8bpp gray, 18bpp and 24bpp
color scans.</p>
<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
this backend, please let us know by sending the scanner's model name,
SCSI id, and firmware revision to
<em>sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net</em>. Have a look at
<em>http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</em> concerning
subscription to sane-devel.</p>
<p>All of these scanners are pre-SCSI-2, and do not even report properly
to SCSI Inquiry. This is typically evident in SCSI bus scans, where the
scanner will come up with only garbage as vendor and models strings.</p>
<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>This backend expects device names of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>special</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>special</em> is the path-name for the special device that
corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the special device
name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device. Under
Linux, such a device name could be <em>/dev/sga</em> or
<em>/dev/sge</em>, for example. See <strong>sane-scsi</strong>(5) for
details.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>agfafocus.conf</em> file is a list of device
names that correspond to AGFA Focus scanners. Empty lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration file
is shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/dev/scanner<br />
# this is a comment<br />
/dev/sge</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/agfafocus.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The backend configuration file (see also description of
<strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.a</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.so</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in <em>/etc/sane.d</em>. If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories <em>tmp/config</em>,
<em>.</em>, and <em>/etc/sane.d</em> being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity. <strong>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS</strong> values:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>Number  Remark

<h1>MISSING FUNCTIONALITY</h1>
<p>Uploading of dither matrices and tonecurves has been implemented, but
so far has not proven to be useful for anything. For this reason these
options have been disabled.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>The scanners that do not support disconnect have problems with SCSI
timeouts if the SCSI bus gets loaded, eg. if you do a kernel build at
the same time as scanning. To see if your scanner supports disconnect,
run <em>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS=128 scanimage -L</em> in a terminal and
look for the "disconnect:" line.</p>
<h1>DEBUG</h1>
<p>If you have problems with SANE not detecting your scanner, make sure
the Artec backend is disabled. Somehow, this backend causes at least my
scanner not to respond correctly to SCSI inquiry commands.</p>
<p>If you encounter a bug please set the environment variable
<strong>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS</strong> to 128 and try to regenerate the
problem. Then send me a report with the log attached.</p>
<p>If you encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or displaced images
please also set the environment variable
<strong>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI</strong> to 128 before sending me the
report.</p>
<h1>TODO</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>More scanners?</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The AGFA ACS and ARCUS scanners are similar to the FOCUS scanners.
The driver could probably be extended to support these scanners without
too many changes. I do not have access to such scanners, and cannot add
support for it. However, if you are in possession of such a scanner, I
could be helpful in adding support for these scanners.</p>
<p>The AGFA HORIZON scanners are SCSI-2 scanners, and it would probably
be easier to support these scanners in a SCSI-2 compliant backend.</p>
