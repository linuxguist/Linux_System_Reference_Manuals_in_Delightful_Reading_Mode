<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-coolscan3 - SANE backend for Nikon Coolscan film scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-coolscan3</strong> library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Nikon Coolscan
film scanners. Some functions of this backend should be considered
<strong>beta-quality</strong> software. Most functions have been stable
for a long time, but of course new development can not and will not
function properly from the very first day.</p>
<p>At present, the following scanners are known to work with this
backend:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Model:                       Connection Type
---------------------------  -------------------
LS-30 (Coolscan III)         SCSI
LS-40 ED (Coolscan IV)       USB
LS-50 ED (Coolscan V)        USB
LS-2000                      SCSI
LS-4000 ED                   IEEE 1394
LS-8000 ED                   IEEE 1394</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Please send mail to <em>sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net</em> to
report successes or failures.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The options the backend supports can either be selected through
command line options to programs like <strong>scanimage</strong>(1) or
through GUI elements in <strong>xscanimage</strong>(1) or
<strong>xsane</strong>(1).</p>
<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by
using:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scanimage --help -d coolscan3:&lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where &lt;interface&gt; and &lt;device&gt; specify the device in
question, as in the configuration file (see next section). The
<strong>-d</strong> parameter and its argument can be omitted to obtain
information on the first scanner identified. Use the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scanimage -L</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to list all devices recognized by your SANE installation.</p>
<p>The options should be fully described by the description or tooltips
given by frontend. Here is a description of some of the most important
options, in the syntax with which they must be supplied to
<strong>scanimage</strong>(1):</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--frame &lt;n&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies which frame to operate on, if a motorized film
strip feeder or APS adapter are used. The frame number
<em>&lt;n&gt;</em> ranges from 1 to the number of frames available,
which is sensed each time the backend is initialized (usually each time
you start the frontend).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--subframe &lt;x&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option shifts the scan window by the specified amount (default
unit is mm).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--infrared=yes/no</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to "yes", the scanner will read the infrared channel, thus
allowing defect removal in software. The infrared image is read during a
second scan, with no options altered. The backend must not be restarted
between the scans. If you use scanimage, perform a batch scan with
<strong>--batch-count=2</strong> to obtain the IR information.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--depth &lt;n&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Here &lt;n&gt; can either be 8 or the maximum number of bits
supported by the scanner (10, 12, or 14). It specifies whether or not
the scanner reduces the scanned data to 8 bits before sending it to the
backend. If 8 bits are used, some information and thus image quality is
lost, but the amount of data is smaller compared to higher depths. Also,
many imaging programs and image formats cannot handle depths greater
than 8 bits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--autofocus</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Perform autofocus operation. Unless otherwise specified by the other
options ( <strong>--focus-on-centre</strong> and friends), focusing is
performed on the centre of the selected scan area.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--ae-wb</strong></dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--ae</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Perform a pre-scan to calculate exposure values automatically.
<strong>--ae-wb</strong> will maintain the white balance, while
<strong>--ae</strong> will adjust each channel separately.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--exposure</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Multiply all exposure times with this value. This allows exposure
correction without modifying white balance.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--load</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Load the next slide when using the slide loader (SF-200 bulk loader
only).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--eject</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Eject the film strip or mounted slide when using the slide
loader.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--reset</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Reset scanner. The scanner will perform the same action as when power
is turned on: it will eject the film strip (with the SF-200 bulk loader)
and calibrate itself. Use this whenever the scanner refuses to load a
film strip properly, as a result of which <strong>--eject</strong> does
not work.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILE</h1>
<p>The configuration file <em>/etc/sane.d/coolscan3.conf</em> specifies
the device(s) that the backend will use. Owing to the nature of the
supported connection types SCSI, USB, and IEEE 1394, the default
configuration file supplied with the SANE distribution should work
without being edited.</p>
<p>Each line in the configuration file is either of the following, where
all entries are case-sensitive:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>blank or starting with a '#' character</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>These lines are ignored, thus '#' can be used to include
comments.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>containing only the word "auto"</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This instructs the backend to probe for a scanner by scanning the
buses for devices with known identifiers. This is the default action
when no configuration file is present.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>a line of the form &lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt;</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Here &lt;interface&gt; can be one of "scsi" or "usb", and
&lt;device&gt; is the device file of the scanner. Note that IEEE 1394
devices are handled by the SBP-2 module in the kernel and appear to SANE
as SCSI devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-coolscan3.a</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-coolscan3.so</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/coolscan3.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Configuration file for this backend, read each time the backend is
initialized.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN3</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>
</dd>

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Currently, the SANE protocol does not allow automatically updating
options whenever the hardware changes. Thus the number of choices for
the <strong>--frame</strong> option will be fixed when the backend is
initialized (usually when the user runs the frontend). In particular, if
there is no film strip in the automatic film strip feeder when the
backend is initialized, the <strong>--frame</strong> option will not
appear at all. Also, restarting the frontend after swapping film
adapters is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Linux kernels prior to 2.4.19 had a patch that truncated INQUIRY data
from IEEE 1394 scanners to 36 bytes, discarding vital information about
the scanner. The IEEE 1394 models therefore only work with 2.4.19 or
later.</p>
<p>No real bugs currently known, please report any to the SANE
developers' list.</p>
