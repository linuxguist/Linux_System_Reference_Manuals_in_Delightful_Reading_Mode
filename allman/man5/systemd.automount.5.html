<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd.automount - Automount unit configuration</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em>automount</em>.automount</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".automount" encodes
information about a file system automount point controlled and
supervised by systemd. Automount units may be used to implement
on-demand mounting as well as parallelized mounting of file systems.</p>
<p>This man page lists the configuration options specific to this unit
type. See <strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5) for the common options of all
unit configuration files. The common configuration items are configured
in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The automount specific
configuration options are configured in the [Automount] section.</p>
<p>Automount units must be named after the automount directories they
control. Example: the automount point /home/lennart must be configured
in a unit file home-lennart.automount. For details about the escaping
logic used to convert a file system path to a unit name see
<strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5). Note that automount units cannot be
templated, nor is it possible to add multiple names to an automount unit
by creating symlinks to its unit file.</p>
<p>For each automount unit file a matching mount unit file (see
<strong>systemd.mount</strong>(5) for details) must exist which is
activated when the automount path is accessed. Example: if an automount
unit home-lennart.automount is active and the user accesses
/home/lennart the mount unit home-lennart.mount will be activated.</p>
<p>Note that automount units are separate from the mount itself, so you
should not set <em>After=</em> or <em>Requires=</em> for mount
dependencies here. For example, you should not set
<em>After=network-online.target</em> or similar on network filesystems.
Doing so may result in an ordering cycle.</p>
<p>Note that automount support on Linux is privileged, automount units
are hence only available in the system service manager (and roots user
service manager), but not in unprivileged users service managers.</p>
<p>Note that automount units should not be nested. (The establishment of
the inner automount point would unconditionally pin the outer mount
point, defeating its purpose.)</p>
<h1>AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES</h1>
<h2>Implicit Dependencies</h2>
<p>The following dependencies are implicitly added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>路</p>
<p>If an automount unit is beneath another mount unit in the file system
hierarchy, a requirement and ordering dependencies are created to the on
the unit higher in the hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>路</p>
<p>An implicit <em>Before=</em> dependency is created between an
automount unit and the mount unit it activates.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Default Dependencies</h2>
<p>The following dependencies are added unless
<em>DefaultDependencies=no</em> is set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>路</p>
<p>Automount units acquire automatic <em>Before=</em> and
<em>Conflicts=</em> on umount.target in order to be stopped during
shutdown.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>路</p>
<p>Automount units automatically gain an <em>After=</em> dependency on
local-fs-pre.target, and a <em>Before=</em> dependency on
local-fs.target.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>FSTAB</h1>
<p>Automount units may either be configured via unit files, or via
/etc/fstab (see <strong>fstab</strong>(5) for details).</p>
<p>For details how systemd parses /etc/fstab see
<strong>systemd.mount</strong>(5).</p>
<p>If an automount point is configured in both /etc/fstab and a unit
file, the configuration in the latter takes precedence.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Automount unit files may include [Unit] and [Install] sections, which
are described in <strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5).</p>
<p>Automount unit files must include an [Automount] section, which
carries information about the file system automount points it
supervises. The options specific to the [Automount] section of automount
units are the following:</p>
<p><em>Where=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes an absolute path of a directory of the automount point. If the
automount point does not exist at time that the automount point is
installed, it is created. This string must be reflected in the unit
filename. (See above.) This option is mandatory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ExtraOptions=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extra mount options to use when creating the autofs mountpoint. This
takes a comma-separated list of options. This setting is optional. Note
that the usual specifier expansion is applied to this setting, literal
percent characters should hence be written as "%%".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>DirectoryMode=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Directories of automount points (and any parent directories) are
automatically created if needed. This option specifies the file system
access mode used when creating these directories. Takes an access mode
in octal notation. Defaults to 0755.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>TimeoutIdleSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures an idle timeout. Once the mount has been idle for the
specified time, systemd will attempt to unmount. Takes a unit-less value
in seconds, or a time span value such as "5min 20s". Pass 0 to disable
the timeout logic. The timeout is disabled by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check <strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5),
<strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5), and <strong>systemd.kill</strong>(5)
for more settings.</p>
