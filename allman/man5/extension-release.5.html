<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>os-release, initrd-release, extension-release - Operating system
identification</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/os-release</p>
<p>/usr/lib/os-release</p>
<p>/etc/initrd-release</p>
<p>/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<em>IMAGE</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The /etc/os-release and /usr/lib/os-release files contain operating
system identification data.</p>
<p>The format of os-release is a newline-separated list of
environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is possible
to source the configuration from Bourne shell scripts, however, beyond
mere variable assignments, no shell features are supported (this means
variable expansion is explicitly not supported), allowing applications
to read the file without implementing a shell compatible execution
engine. Variable assignment values must be enclosed in double or single
quotes if they include spaces, semicolons or other special characters
outside of A–Z, a–z, 0–9. (Assignments that do not include these special
characters may be enclosed in quotes too, but this is optional.) Shell
special characters ("$", quotes, backslash, backtick) must be escaped
with backslashes, following shell style. All strings should be in UTF-8
encoding, and non-printable characters should not be used. Concatenation
of multiple individually quoted strings is not supported. Lines
beginning with "#" are treated as comments. Blank lines are permitted
and ignored.</p>
<p>The file /etc/os-release takes precedence over /usr/lib/os-release.
Applications should check for the former, and exclusively use its data
if it exists, and only fall back to /usr/lib/os-release if it is
missing. Applications should not read data from both files at the same
time. /usr/lib/os-release is the recommended place to store OS release
information as part of vendor trees. /etc/os-release should be a
relative symlink to /usr/lib/os-release, to provide compatibility with
applications only looking at /etc/. A relative symlink instead of an
absolute symlink is necessary to avoid breaking the link in a chroot or
initrd environment such as dracut.</p>
<p>os-release contains data that is defined by the operating system
vendor and should generally not be changed by the administrator.</p>
<p>As this file only encodes names and identifiers it should not be
localized.</p>
<p>The /etc/os-release and /usr/lib/os-release files might be symlinks
to other files, but it is important that the file is available from
earliest boot on, and hence must be located on the root file system.</p>
<p>os-release must not contain repeating keys. Nevertheless, readers
should pick the entries later in the file in case of repeats, similarly
to how a shell sourcing the file would. A reader may warn about
repeating entries.</p>
<p>For a longer rationale for os-release please refer to the
<strong>Announcement of /etc/os-release</strong>[1].</p>
<h2>/etc/initrd-release</h2>
<p>In the <strong>initrd</strong>[2], /etc/initrd-release plays the same
role as os-release in the main system. Additionally, the presence of
that file means that the system is in the initrd phase. /etc/os-release
should be symlinked to /etc/initrd-release (or vice versa), so programs
that only look for /etc/os-release (as described above) work
correctly.</p>
<p>The rest of this document that talks about os-release should be
understood to apply to initrd-release too.</p>
<h2>/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<em>IMAGE</em></h2>
<p>/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<em>IMAGE</em> plays
the same role for extension images as os-release for the main system,
and follows the syntax and rules as described in the <strong>Portable
Services Documentation</strong>[3]. The purpose of this file is to
identify the extension and to allow the operating system to verify that
the extension image matches the base OS. This is typically implemented
by checking that the <em>ID=</em> options match, and either
<em>SYSEXT_LEVEL=</em> exists and matches too, or if it is not present,
<em>VERSION_ID=</em> exists and matches. This ensures ABI/API
compatibility between the layers and prevents merging of an incompatible
image in an overlay.</p>
<p>In the extension-release.<em>IMAGE</em> filename, the <em>IMAGE</em>
part must exactly match the file name of the containing image with the
suffix removed. In case it is not possible to guarantee that an image
file name is stable and doesnt change between the build and the
deployment phases, it is possible to relax this check: if exactly one
file whose name matches "extension-release.*" is present in this
directory, and the file is tagged with a
<em>user.extension-release.strict</em> <strong>xattr</strong>(7) set to
the string "0", it will be used instead.</p>
<p>The rest of this document that talks about os-release should be
understood to apply to extension-release too.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following OS identifications parameters may be set using
os-release:</p>
<h2>General information identifying the operating system</h2>
<p><em>NAME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string identifying the operating system, without a version
component, and suitable for presentation to the user. If not set, a
default of "NAME=Linux" may be used.</p>
<p>Examples: "NAME=Fedora", "NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ID=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9,
a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system, excluding any
version information and suitable for processing by scripts or usage in
generated filenames. If not set, a default of "ID=linux" may be used.
Note that even though this string may not include characters that
require shell quoting, quoting may nevertheless be used.</p>
<p>Examples: "ID=fedora", "ID=debian".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ID_LIKE=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A space-separated list of operating system identifiers in the same
syntax as the <em>ID=</em> setting. It should list identifiers of
operating systems that are closely related to the local operating system
in regards to packaging and programming interfaces, for example listing
one or more OS identifiers the local OS is a derivative from. An OS
should generally only list other OS identifiers it itself is a
derivative of, and not any OSes that are derived from it, though
symmetric relationships are possible. Build scripts and similar should
check this variable if they need to identify the local operating system
and the value of <em>ID=</em> is not recognized. Operating systems
should be listed in order of how closely the local operating system
relates to the listed ones, starting with the closest. This field is
optional.</p>
<p>Examples: for an operating system with "ID=centos", an assignment of
"ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"" would be appropriate. For an operating system
with "ID=ubuntu", an assignment of "ID_LIKE=debian" is appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PRETTY_NAME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pretty operating system name in a format suitable for presentation
to the user. May or may not contain a release code name or OS version of
some kind, as suitable. If not set, a default of "PRETTY_NAME="Linux""
may be used</p>
<p>Example: "PRETTY_NAME="Fedora 17 (Beefy Miracle)"".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CPE_NAME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A CPE name for the operating system, in URI binding syntax, following
the <strong>Common Platform Enumeration Specification</strong>[4] as
proposed by the NIST. This field is optional.</p>
<p>Example: "CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:fedoraproject:fedora:17""</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>VARIANT=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string identifying a specific variant or edition of the operating
system suitable for presentation to the user. This field may be used to
inform the user that the configuration of this system is subject to a
specific divergent set of rules or default configuration settings. This
field is optional and may not be implemented on all systems.</p>
<p>Examples: "VARIANT="Server Edition"", "VARIANT="Smart Refrigerator
Edition"".</p>
<p>Note: this field is for display purposes only. The
<em>VARIANT_ID</em> field should be used for making programmatic
decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>VARIANT_ID=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9,
a–z, ".", "_" and "-"), identifying a specific variant or edition of the
operating system. This may be interpreted by other packages in order to
determine a divergent default configuration. This field is optional and
may not be implemented on all systems.</p>
<p>Examples: "VARIANT_ID=server", "VARIANT_ID=embedded".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Information about the version of the operating system</h2>
<p><em>VERSION=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string identifying the operating system version, excluding any OS
name information, possibly including a release code name, and suitable
for presentation to the user. This field is optional.</p>
<p>Examples: "VERSION=17", "VERSION="17 (Beefy Miracle)"".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>VERSION_ID=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other characters
outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system
version, excluding any OS name information or release code name, and
suitable for processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. This
field is optional.</p>
<p>Examples: "VERSION_ID=17", "VERSION_ID=11.04".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>VERSION_CODENAME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9,
a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system release code
name, excluding any OS name information or release version, and suitable
for processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. This field is
optional and may not be implemented on all systems.</p>
<p>Examples: "VERSION_CODENAME=buster", "VERSION_CODENAME=xenial".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>BUILD_ID=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string uniquely identifying the system image originally used as the
installation base. In most cases, <em>VERSION_ID</em> or
<em>IMAGE_ID</em>+<em>IMAGE_VERSION</em> are updated when the entire
system image is replaced during an update. <em>BUILD_ID</em> may be used
in distributions where the original installation image version is
important: <em>VERSION_ID</em> would change during incremental system
updates, but <em>BUILD_ID</em> would not. This field is optional.</p>
<p>Examples: "BUILD_ID="2013-03-20.3"", "BUILD_ID=201303203".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IMAGE_ID=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9,
a–z, ".", "_" and "-"), identifying a specific image of the operating
system. This is supposed to be used for environments where OS images are
prepared, built, shipped and updated as comprehensive, consistent OS
images. This field is optional and may not be implemented on all
systems, in particularly not on those that are not managed via images
but put together and updated from individual packages and on the local
system.</p>
<p>Examples: "IMAGE_ID=vendorx-cashier-system",
"IMAGE_ID=netbook-image".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IMAGE_VERSION=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other characters
outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the OS image version.
This is supposed to be used together with <em>IMAGE_ID</em> described
above, to discern different versions of the same image.</p>
<p>Examples: "IMAGE_VERSION=33", "IMAGE_VERSION=47.1rc1".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize: if the image updates are built and shipped as
comprehensive units, <em>IMAGE_ID</em>+<em>IMAGE_VERSION</em> is the
best fit. Otherwise, if updates eventually completely replace previously
installed contents, as in a typical binary distribution,
<em>VERSION_ID</em> should be used to identify major releases of the
operating system. <em>BUILD_ID</em> may be used instead or in addition
to <em>VERSION_ID</em> when the original system image version is
important.</p>
<h2>Presentation information and links</h2>
<p><em>HOME_URL=</em>, <em>DOCUMENTATION_URL=</em>,
<em>SUPPORT_URL=</em>, <em>BUG_REPORT_URL=</em>,
<em>PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Links to resources on the Internet related to the operating system.
<em>HOME_URL=</em> should refer to the homepage of the operating system,
or alternatively some homepage of the specific version of the operating
system. <em>DOCUMENTATION_URL=</em> should refer to the main
documentation page for this operating system. <em>SUPPORT_URL=</em>
should refer to the main support page for the operating system, if there
is any. This is primarily intended for operating systems which vendors
provide support for. <em>BUG_REPORT_URL=</em> should refer to the main
bug reporting page for the operating system, if there is any. This is
primarily intended for operating systems that rely on community QA.
<em>PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=</em> should refer to the main privacy policy
page for the operating system, if there is any. These settings are
optional, and providing only some of these settings is common. These
URLs are intended to be exposed in "About this system" UIs behind links
with captions such as "About this Operating System", "Obtain Support",
"Report a Bug", or "Privacy Policy". The values should be in
<strong>RFC3986 format</strong>[5], and should be "http:" or "https:"
URLs, and possibly "mailto:" or "tel:". Only one URL shall be listed in
each setting. If multiple resources need to be referenced, it is
recommended to provide an online landing page linking all available
resources.</p>
<p>Examples: "HOME_URL="https://fedoraproject.org/"",
"BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/"".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SUPPORT_END=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date at which support for this version of the OS ends. (What
exactly "lack of support" means varies between vendors, but generally
users should assume that updates, including security fixes, will not be
provided.) The value is a date in the ISO 8601 format "YYYY-MM-DD", and
specifies the first day on which support <em>is not</em> provided.</p>
<p>For example, "SUPPORT_END=2001-01-01" means that the system was
supported until the end of the last day of the previous millennium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>LOGO=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string, specifying the name of an icon as defined by
<strong>freedesktop.org Icon Theme Specification</strong>[6]. This can
be used by graphical applications to display an operating systems or
distributors logo. This field is optional and may not necessarily be
implemented on all systems.</p>
<p>Examples: "LOGO=fedora-logo", "LOGO=distributor-logo-opensuse"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ANSI_COLOR=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A suggested presentation color when showing the OS name on the
console. This should be specified as string suitable for inclusion in
the ESC [ m ANSI/ECMA-48 escape code for setting graphical rendition.
This field is optional.</p>
<p>Examples: "ANSI_COLOR="0;31"" for red, "ANSI_COLOR="1;34"" for light
blue, or "ANSI_COLOR="0;38;2;60;110;180"" for Fedora blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Distribution-level defaults and metadata</h2>
<p><em>DEFAULT_HOSTNAME=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string specifying the hostname if <strong>hostname</strong>(5) is
not present and no other configuration source specifies the hostname.
Must be either a single DNS label (a string composed of 7-bit ASCII
lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, limited to the format
allowed for DNS domain name labels), or a sequence of such labels
separated by single dots that forms a valid DNS FQDN. The hostname must
be at most 64 characters, which is a Linux limitation (DNS allows longer
names).</p>
<p>See <strong>org.freedesktop.hostname1</strong>(5) for a description
of how <strong>systemd-hostnamed.service</strong>(8) determines the
fallback hostname.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ARCHITECTURE=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string that specifies which CPU architecture the userspace binaries
require. The architecture identifiers are the same as for
<em>ConditionArchitecture=</em> described in
<strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5). The field is optional and should only
be used when just single architecture is supported. It may provide
redundant information when used in a GPT partition with a GUID type that
already encodes the architecture. If this is not the case, the
architecture should be specified in e.g., an extension image, to prevent
an incompatible host from loading it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SYSEXT_LEVEL=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other characters
outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system
extensions support level, to indicate which extension images are
supported. See
/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<em>IMAGE</em>,
<strong>initrd</strong>[2] and <strong>systemd-sysext</strong>(8)) for
more information.</p>
<p>Examples: "SYSEXT_LEVEL=2", "SYSEXT_LEVEL=15.14".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SYSEXT_SCOPE=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a space-separated list of one or more of the strings "system",
"initrd" and "portable". This field is only supported in
extension-release.d/ files and indicates what environments the system
extension is applicable to: i.e. to regular systems, to initrds, or to
portable service images. If unspecified, "SYSEXT_SCOPE=system portable"
is implied, i.e. any system extension without this field is applicable
to regular systems and to portable service environments, but not to
initrd environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PORTABLE_PREFIXES=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a space-separated list of one or more valid prefix match
strings for the <strong>Portable Services</strong>[3] logic. This field
serves two purposes: it is informational, identifying portable service
images as such (and thus allowing them to be distinguished from other OS
images, such as bootable system images). It is also used when a portable
service image is attached: the specified or implied portable service
prefix is checked against the list specified here, to enforce
restrictions how images may be attached to a system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>If you are using this file to determine the OS or a specific version
of it, use the <em>ID</em> and <em>VERSION_ID</em> fields, possibly with
<em>ID_LIKE</em> as fallback for <em>ID</em>. When looking for an OS
identification string for presentation to the user use the
<em>PRETTY_NAME</em> field.</p>
<p>Note that operating system vendors may choose not to provide version
information, for example to accommodate for rolling releases. In this
case, <em>VERSION</em> and <em>VERSION_ID</em> may be unset.
Applications should not rely on these fields to be set.</p>
<p>Operating system vendors may extend the file format and introduce new
fields. It is highly recommended to prefix new fields with an OS
specific name in order to avoid name clashes. Applications reading this
file must ignore unknown fields.</p>
<p>Example: "DEBIAN_BTS="debbugs://bugs.debian.org/"".</p>
<p>Container and sandbox runtime managers may make the hosts
identification data available to applications by providing the hosts
/etc/os-release (if available, otherwise /usr/lib/os-release as a
fallback) as /run/host/os-release.</p>
