<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-mustek_pp - SANE backend for Mustek parallel port flatbed
scanners</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-mustek_pp</strong> library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Mustek
parallel port flatbed scanners and OEM versions.</p>
<p>There are 2 classes of Mustek parallel port scanners: regular
<strong>CCD</strong> (cold cathode device) scanners and
<strong>CIS</strong> (contact image sensor) scanners.</p>
<p>The current version of this backend supports both CCD type scanners
and CIS type scanners.</p>
<p>The following scanners might work with this backend:</p>

<p>(*) Calibration problems existed with earlier version of this driver.
They seem to be solved now.</p>
<p>(**) Problems have been reported in the past for the MD/LT9850 type
(striped scans, head moving in wrong direction at some resolutions). It
is not known whether the current version of the driver still has these
problems.</p>
<p><strong>IF YOU HEAR LOUD CLICKING NOISES, IMMEDIATELY UNPLUG THE
SCANNER !</strong> (This holds for any type of scanner).</p>
<p>(***) Possibly, the engine_delay parameter has to be set to 1 ms for
accurate engine movements.</p>
<p>Please note that this backend is still under construction. Certain
models are currently not supported and some may never be because the
communication protocol is still unknown (eg., SE 12000 P).</p>
<p>Some scanners work faster when <strong>EPP/ECP</strong> is enabled in
the BIOS. EPP mode however may lead to hard-locks on some Linux systems.
If that is the case for you, you can either disable ECP/EPP in your BIOS
or disable it in the backend itself (see GLOBAL OPTIONS).</p>
<p>Note that the backend needs to run as root or has to have appropriate
access rights to <em>/dev/parport*</em> if libieee1284 support is
compiled in. To allow user access to the scanner run the backend through
the network interface (See <strong>saned</strong>(8) and
<strong>sane-net</strong>(5)). Note also that the backend <em>does
not</em> support <em>parport sharing</em>, i.e. if you try printing
while scanning, your computer may crash. To enable parport sharing, you
have to enable libieee1284 at compile time. This backend also conflicts
with the <strong>sane-musteka4s2</strong>(5) backend. You can only
enable one of them in your <em>dll.conf</em>. However, you have to
enable the backend explicitly in your <em>dll.conf</em>, just remove the
hash mark in the line "mustek_pp".</p>
<h1>DEVICE DEFINITION</h1>
<p>This backend allows multiple devices being defined and configured via
the <em>mustek_pp.conf</em> file (even simultaneously, provided that
they are connected to different parallel ports). Please make sure to
edit this file <strong>before</strong> you use the backend.</p>
<p>A device can be defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>scanner &lt;name&gt; &lt;port name&gt; &lt;driver&gt;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where</p>
<p><strong>&lt;name&gt;</strong> is an arbitrary name for the device,
optionally enclosed by double quotes, for instance "LifeTec 9350".</p>
<p><strong>&lt;port name&gt;</strong> is the name of the parallel port
to which the device is connected. In case libieee1284 is used for
communication with the port <em>(default</em> <em>setup)</em>, valid
port names are <strong>parport0</strong>, <strong>parport1</strong>, and
<strong>parport2</strong>.</p>
<p>In case the backend is configured for raw IO <em>(old</em>
<em>setup)</em>, port addresses have to be used instead of port names:
<strong>0x378</strong>, <strong>0x278</strong>, or
<strong>0x3BC</strong>. The mapping of parallel ports (lp0, lp1, and
lp2) to these addresses can be different for different Linux kernel
versions. For instance, if you are using a Kernel 2.2.x or better and
you have only one parallel port, this port is named lp0 regardless of
the base address. However, this backend requires the base address of
your port. If you are not sure which port your scanner is connected to,
have a look at your <em>/etc/conf.modules</em>,
<em>/etc/modules.conf</em> and/or <em>/proc/ioports</em>.</p>
<p>If you are unsure which port to use, you can use the magic value
<strong>*</strong> to probe for your scanner.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;driver&gt;</strong> is the driver to use for this device.
Currently available drivers are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>cis600</strong> : for 600 CP, 96 CP &amp; OEM versions<br />
<strong>cis1200</strong> : for 1200 CP &amp; OEM versions<br />
<strong>cis1200+</strong> : for 1200 CP+ &amp; OEM versions<br />
<strong>ccd300</strong> : for 600 IIIE P &amp; OEM version</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Choosing the wrong driver can damage your
scanner!</strong><br />
Especially, using the 1200CP settings on a 600CP can be harmful. If the
scanner starts making a loud noise, turn it off immediately !!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the cis600 driver on a 1200CP or a 1200CP+ is probably not
dangerous. The cis1200+ driver also works for the 1200CP, and using the
cis1200 driver on a 1200CP+ will typically result in scans that cover
only half of the width of the scan area (also not dangerous).</p>
<p>If unsure about the exact model of your OEM version, check the
optical resolution in the manual or on the box: the 600CP has a maximum
optical resolution of 300x600 DPI, whereas the 1200CP and 1200CP+ have a
maximum optical resolution of 600x1200 DPI.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scanner "LifeTec 9350" 0x378 cis1200</p>
<p>scanner Mustek_600CP 0x378 cis600</p>
<p>scanner Mustek_600IIIEP * ccd300</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If in doubt which port you have to use, or whether your scanner is
detected at all, you can use <em>sane-find-scanner -p</em> to probe all
configured ports.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>mustek_pp.conf</em> file is a list of device
definitions and device options that correspond to Mustek scanners. Empty
lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Options have
the following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>option &lt;name&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the nature of the option, a value may or may not be
present. Options always apply to the scanner definition that precedes
them. There are no global options. Options are also driver-specific: not
all drivers support all possible options.</p>
<h2>Common options</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>bw &lt;value&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Black/white discrimination value to be used during lineart scanning.
Pixel values below this value are assumed to be black, values above are
assumed to be white.<br />
Default value: 127<br />
Minimum: 0<br />
Maximum: 255</p>
<p>Example: option bw 150</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>CIS driver options</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>top_adjust &lt;value&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Vertical adjustment of the origin, expressed in millimeter (floating
point). This option can be used to calibrate the position of the origin,
within certain limits. Note that CIS scanners are probably temperature
sensitive, and that a certain inaccuracy may be hard to avoid.
Differences in offset between runs in the order of 1 to 2 mm are not
unusual.<br />
Default value: 0.0<br />
Minimum: -5.0<br />
Maximum: 5.0<br />
</p>
<p>Example: option top_adjust -2.5</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>slow_skip</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns fast skipping to the start of the scan region off. When the
region to scan does not start at the origin, the driver will try to move
the scanhead to the start of the scan area at the fastest possible
speed. On some models, this may not work, resulting in large
inaccuracies (up to centimeters). By setting this option, the driver is
forced to use normal speed during skipping, which can circumvent the
accuracy problems. Currently, there are no models for which these
inaccuracy problems are known to occur.</p>
<p>By default, fast skipping is used.</p>
<p>Example: option slow_skip</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>engine_delay &lt;value&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it is sufficient for the driver to wait
for the scanner signaling that the engine is stable, before a new engine
command can be transmitted. In rare cases, certain scanners and/or
parallel port chipsets appear to prevent reliable detection of the
engine state. As a result, engine commands are transmitted too soon and
the movement of the scanner head becomes unreliable. Inaccuracies
ranging up to 10 cm over the whole vertical scan range have been
reported. To work around this problem, the engine_delay option can be
set. If it is set, the driver waits an additional amount of time after
every engine command, equal to the engine_delay parameter, expressed in
milliseconds. It practice an engine_delay of 1 ms is usually sufficient.
The maximum delay is 100 ms.</p>
<p>Note that every additional ms of delay can add up to 14 seconds to
the total scanning time (highest resolution), so an as small as possible
value is preferred.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br />
Minimum: 0<br />
Maximum: 100</p>
<p>Example: option engine_delay 1</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>CCD driver options</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>top &lt;value&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of scanlines to skip to the start of the scan area. The number
can be any positive integer. Values known to me are 47 and 56.</p>
<p>Default value: 47<br />
Minimum: 0<br />
Maximum: none<br />
</p>
<p>Example: option top 56</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>waitbank &lt;value&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of usecs to wait for a bank change. You should not touch
this value actually. May be any positive integer</p>
<p>Default value: 700<br />
Minimum: 0<br />
Maximum: none</p>
<p>Example: option waitbank 700</p>
</dd>

<h1>GLOBAL OPTIONS</h1>
<p>You can control the overall behaviour of the
<strong>sane-stek_pp</strong> backend by global options which precede
any scanner definition in the <em>mustek_pp.conf</em> file.</p>
<p>Currently, there is only one global option:</p>
<h2>Global options</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>no_epp</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable parallel port mode EPP: works around a known bug in the Linux
parport code. Enable this option, if the backend hangs when trying to
access the parallel port in EPP mode.</p>
<p>Default value: use EPP</p>
<p>Example: option no_epp</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/mustek_pp.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The backend configuration file (see also description of
<strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.a</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.so</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in <em>/etc/sane.d</em>. If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories <em>tmp/config</em>,
<em>.</em>, and <em>/etc/sane.d</em> being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>
<pre><code>level   debug output
--------------------------------------
 0      nothing
 1      errors
 2      warnings &amp; minor errors
 3      additional information

 6      special debug information</code></pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_PA4S2</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable sets the debug level for the SANE interface for the
Mustek chipset A4S2. Note that enabling this will spam your terminal
with some million lines of debug output.</p>
<pre><code>level   debug output
