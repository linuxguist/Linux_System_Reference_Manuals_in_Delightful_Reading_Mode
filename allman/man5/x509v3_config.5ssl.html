<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>x509v3_config - X509 V3 certificate extension configuration
format</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Several OpenSSL commands can add extensions to a certificate or
certificate request based on the contents of a configuration file and
CLI options such as <strong>-addext</strong>. The syntax of
configuration files is described in <strong>config</strong> (5). The
commands typically have an option to specify the name of the
configuration file, and a section within that file; see the
documentation of the individual command for details.</p>
<p>This page uses <strong>extensions</strong> as the name of the
section, when needed in examples.</p>
<p>Each entry in the extension section takes the form:</p>
<p>name = [critical, ]value(s)</p>
<p>If <strong>critical</strong> is present then the extension will be
marked as critical.</p>
<p>If multiple entries are processed for the same extension name, later
entries override earlier ones with the same name.</p>
<p>The format of <strong>values</strong> depends on the value of
<strong>name</strong>, many have a type-value pairing where the type and
value are separated by a colon. There are four main types of
extension:</p>
<p>string multi-valued raw arbitrary</p>
<p>Each is described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>String extensions simply have a string which contains either the
value itself or how it is obtained.</p>
<p>Multi-valued extensions have a short form and a long form. The short
form is a comma-separated list of names and values:</p>
<p>basicConstraints = critical, CA:true, pathlen:1</p>
<p>The long form allows the values to be placed in a separate
section:</p>
<p>[extensions] basicConstraints = critical, @basic_constraints
[basic_constraints] CA = true pathlen = 1</p>
<p>Both forms are equivalent.</p>
<p>If an extension is multi-value and a field value must contain a comma
the long form must be used otherwise the comma would be misinterpreted
as a field separator. For example:</p>
<p>subjectAltName = URI:ldap://somehost.com/CN=foo,OU=bar</p>
<p>will produce an error but the equivalent form:</p>
<p>[extensions] subjectAltName = @subject_alt_section
[subject_alt_section] subjectAltName =
URI:ldap://somehost.com/CN=foo,OU=bar</p>
<p>is valid.</p>
<p>OpenSSL does not support multiple occurrences of the same field
within a section. In this example:</p>
<p>[extensions] subjectAltName = @alt_section [alt_section] email =
steve@example.com email = steve@example.org</p>
<p>will only recognize the last value. To specify multiple values append
a numeric identifier, as shown here:</p>
<p>[extensions] subjectAltName = @alt_section [alt_section] email.1 =
steve@example.com email.2 = steve@example.org</p>
<p>The syntax of raw extensions is defined by the source code that
parses the extension but should be documented. See Certificate Policies
for an example of a raw extension.</p>
<p>If an extension type is unsupported, then the <em>arbitrary</em>
extension syntax must be used, see the ARBITRARY EXTENSIONS section for
more details.</p>
<h1>STANDARD EXTENSIONS</h1>
<p>The following sections describe the syntax of each supported
extension. They do not define the semantics of the extension.</p>
<h2>Basic Constraints</h2>
<p>This is a multi-valued extension which indicates whether a
certificate is a CA certificate. The first value is <strong>CA</strong>
followed by <strong>TRUE</strong> or <strong>FALSE</strong>. If
<strong>CA</strong> is <strong>TRUE</strong> then an optional
<strong>pathlen</strong> name followed by a nonnegative value can be
included.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>basicConstraints = CA:TRUE basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
basicConstraints = critical, CA:TRUE, pathlen:1</p>
<p>A CA certificate <em>must</em> include the
<strong>basicConstraints</strong> name with the <strong>CA</strong>
parameter set to <strong>TRUE</strong>. An end-user certificate must
either have <strong>CA:FALSE</strong> or omit the extension entirely.
The <strong>pathlen</strong> parameter specifies the maximum number of
CAs that can appear below this one in a chain. A
<strong>pathlen</strong> of zero means the CA cannot sign any sub-CA's,
and can only sign end-entity certificates.</p>
<h2>Key Usage</h2>
<p>Key usage is a multi-valued extension consisting of a list of names
of the permitted key usages. The defined values are:
<code>digitalSignature</code>, <code>nonRepudiation</code>,
<code>keyEncipherment</code>, <code>dataEncipherment</code>,
<code>keyAgreement</code>, <code>keyCertSign</code>,
<code>cRLSign</code>, <code>encipherOnly</code>, and
<code>decipherOnly</code>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation keyUsage = critical,
keyCertSign</p>
<h2>Extended Key Usage</h2>
<p>This extension consists of a list of values indicating purposes for
which the certificate public key can be used. Each value can be either a
short text name or an OID. The following text names, and their intended
meaning, are known:</p>
<p>Value Meaning according to RFC 5280 etc. -----
---------------------------------- serverAuth SSL/TLS WWW Server
Authentication clientAuth SSL/TLS WWW Client Authentication codeSigning
Code Signing emailProtection E-mail Protection (S/MIME) timeStamping
Trusted Timestamping OCSPSigning OCSP Signing ipsecIKE ipsec Internet
Key Exchange msCodeInd Microsoft Individual Code Signing (authenticode)
msCodeCom Microsoft Commercial Code Signing (authenticode) msCTLSign
Microsoft Trust List Signing msEFS Microsoft Encrypted File System</p>
<p>While IETF RFC 5280 says that <strong>id-kp-serverAuth</strong> and
<strong>id-kp-clientAuth</strong> are only for WWW use, in practice they
are used for all kinds of TLS clients and servers, and this is what
OpenSSL assumes as well.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>extendedKeyUsage = critical, codeSigning, 1.2.3.4 extendedKeyUsage =
serverAuth, clientAuth</p>
<h2>Subject Key Identifier</h2>
<p>The SKID extension specification has a value with three choices. If
the value is the word <strong>none</strong> then no SKID extension will
be included. If the value is the word <strong>hash</strong>, or by
default for the <strong>x509</strong>, <strong>req</strong>, and
<strong>ca</strong> apps, the process specified in RFC 5280 section
4.2.1.2. (1) is followed: The keyIdentifier is composed of the 160-bit
SHA-1 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding
the tag, length, and number of unused bits).</p>
<p>Otherwise, the value must be a hex string (possibly with
<code>:</code> separating bytes) to output directly, however, this is
strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>subjectKeyIdentifier = hash</p>
<h2>Authority Key Identifier</h2>
<p>The AKID extension specification may have the value
<strong>none</strong> indicating that no AKID shall be included.
Otherwise it may have the value <strong>keyid</strong> or
<strong>issuer</strong> or both of them, separated by <code>,</code>.
Either or both can have the option <strong>always</strong>, indicated by
putting a colon <code>:</code> between the value and this option. For
self-signed certificates the AKID is suppressed unless
<strong>always</strong> is present. By default the
<strong>x509</strong>, <strong>req</strong>, and <strong>ca</strong>
apps behave as if none was given for self-signed certificates and keyid,
issuer otherwise.</p>
<p>If <strong>keyid</strong> is present, an attempt is made to copy the
subject key identifier (SKID) from the issuer certificate except if the
issuer certificate is the same as the current one and it is not
self-signed. The hash of the public key related to the signing key is
taken as fallback if the issuer certificate is the same as the current
certificate. If <strong>always</strong> is present but no value can be
obtained, an error is returned.</p>
<p>If <strong>issuer</strong> is present, and in addition it has the
option <strong>always</strong> specified or <strong>keyid</strong> is
not present, then the issuer DN and serial number are copied from the
issuer certificate.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid, issuer authorityKeyIdentifier =
keyid, issuer:always</p>
<h2>Subject Alternative Name</h2>
<p>This is a multi-valued extension that supports several types of name
identifier, including <strong>email</strong> (an email address),
<strong>URI</strong> (a uniform resource indicator),
<strong>DNS</strong> (a DNS domain name), <strong>RID</strong> (a
registered ID: OBJECT IDENTIFIER), <strong>IP</strong> (an IP address),
<strong>dirName</strong> (a distinguished name), and
<strong>otherName</strong>. The syntax of each is described in the
following paragraphs.</p>
<p>The <strong>email</strong> option has two special values.
<code>copy</code> will automatically include any email addresses
contained in the certificate subject name in the extension.
<code>move</code> will automatically move any email addresses from the
certificate subject name to the extension.</p>
<p>The IP address used in the <strong>IP</strong> option can be in
either IPv4 or IPv6 format.</p>
<p>The value of <strong>dirName</strong> is specifies the configuration
section containing the distinguished name to use, as a set of name-value
pairs. Multi-valued AVAs can be formed by prefacing the name with a
<strong>+</strong> character.</p>
<p>The value of <strong>otherName</strong> can include arbitrary data
associated with an OID; the value should be the OID followed by a
semicolon and the content in specified using the syntax in
<strong>ASN1_generate_nconf</strong> (3).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>subjectAltName = email:copy, email:my@example.com,
URI:http://my.example.com/ subjectAltName = IP:192.168.7.1
subjectAltName = IP:13::17 subjectAltName = email:my@example.com,
RID:1.2.3.4 subjectAltName = otherName:1.2.3.4;UTF8:some other
identifier [extensions] subjectAltName = dirName:dir_sect [dir_sect] C =
UK O = My Organization OU = My Unit CN = My Name</p>
<p>Non-ASCII Email Address conforming the syntax defined in Section 3.3
of RFC 6531 are provided as otherName.SmtpUTF8Mailbox. According to RFC
8398, the email address should be provided as UTF8String. To enforce the
valid representation in the certificate, the SmtpUTF8Mailbox should be
provided as follows</p>
<p>subjectAltName=@alts [alts] otherName =
1.3.6.1.5.5.7.8.9;FORMAT:UTF8,UTF8String:nonasciiname.example.com</p>
<h2>Issuer Alternative Name</h2>
<p>This extension supports most of the options of subject alternative
name; it does not support <strong>email:copy</strong>. It also adds
<strong>issuer:copy</strong> as an allowed value, which copies any
subject alternative names from the issuer certificate, if possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>issuerAltName = issuer:copy</p>
<h2>Authority Info Access</h2>
<p>This extension gives details about how to retrieve information that
related to the certificate that the CA makes available. The syntax is
<strong>access_id;location</strong>, where <strong>access_id</strong> is
an object identifier (although only a few values are well-known) and
<strong>location</strong> has the same syntax as subject alternative
name (except that <strong>email:copy</strong> is not supported).</p>
<p>Possible values for access_id include <strong>OCSP</strong> (OCSP
responder), <strong>caIssuers</strong> (CA Issuers),
<strong>ad_timestamping</strong> (AD Time Stamping),
<strong>AD_DVCS</strong> (ad dvcs), <strong>caRepository</strong> (CA
Repository).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>authorityInfoAccess =
OCSP;URI:http://ocsp.example.com/,caIssuers;URI:http://myca.example.com/ca.cer
authorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI:http://ocsp.example.com/</p>
<h2>CRL distribution points</h2>
<p>This is a multi-valued extension whose values can be either a
name-value pair using the same form as subject alternative name or a
single value specifying the section name containing all the distribution
point values.</p>
<p>When a name-value pair is used, a DistributionPoint extension will be
set with the given value as the fullName field as the distributionPoint
value, and the reasons and cRLIssuer fields will be omitted.</p>
<p>When a single option is used, the value specifies the section, and
that section can have the following items:</p>
<dl>
<dt>fullname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The full name of the distribution point, in the same format as the
subject alternative name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>relativename</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value is taken as a distinguished name fragment that is set as
the value of the nameRelativeToCRLIssuer field.</p>
</dd>
<dt>CRLIssuer</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value must in the same format as the subject alternative
name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>reasons</dt>
<dd>
<p>A multi-value field that contains the reasons for revocation. The
recognized values are: <code>keyCompromise</code>,
<code>CACompromise</code>, <code>affiliationChanged</code>,
<code>superseded</code>, <code>cessationOfOperation</code>,
<code>certificateHold</code>, <code>privilegeWithdrawn</code>, and
<code>AACompromise</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Only one of <strong>fullname</strong> or
<strong>relativename</strong> should be specified.</p>
<p>Simple examples:</p>
<p>crlDistributionPoints = URI:http://example.com/myca.crl
crlDistributionPoints = URI:http://example.com/myca.crl,
URI:http://example.org/my.crl</p>
<p>Full distribution point example:</p>
<p>[extensions] crlDistributionPoints = crldp1_section [crldp1_section]
fullname = URI:http://example.com/myca.crl CRLissuer =
dirName:issuer_sect reasons = keyCompromise, CACompromise [issuer_sect]
C = UK O = Organisation CN = Some Name</p>
<h2>Issuing Distribution Point</h2>
<p>This extension should only appear in CRLs. It is a multi-valued
extension whose syntax is similar to the section pointed to by the CRL
distribution points extension. The following names have meaning:</p>
<dl>
<dt>fullname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The full name of the distribution point, in the same format as the
subject alternative name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>relativename</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value is taken as a distinguished name fragment that is set as
the value of the nameRelativeToCRLIssuer field.</p>
</dd>
<dt>onlysomereasons</dt>
<dd>
<p>A multi-value field that contains the reasons for revocation. The
recognized values are: <code>keyCompromise</code>,
<code>CACompromise</code>, <code>affiliationChanged</code>,
<code>superseded</code>, <code>cessationOfOperation</code>,
<code>certificateHold</code>, <code>privilegeWithdrawn</code>, and
<code>AACompromise</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>onlyuser, onlyCA, onlyAA, indirectCRL</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value for each of these names is a boolean.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>[extensions] issuingDistributionPoint = critical, @idp_section
[idp_section] fullname = URI:http://example.com/myca.crl indirectCRL =
TRUE onlysomereasons = keyCompromise, CACompromise</p>
<h2>Certificate Policies</h2>
<p>This is a <em>raw</em> extension that supports all of the defined
fields of the certificate extension.</p>
<p>Policies without qualifiers are specified by giving the OID. Multiple
policies are comma-separated. For example:</p>
<p>certificatePolicies = 1.2.4.5, 1.1.3.4</p>
<p>To include policy qualifiers, use the @section syntax to point to a
section that specifies all the information.</p>
<p>The section referred to must include the policy OID using the name
<strong>policyIdentifier</strong>. cPSuri qualifiers can be included
using the syntax:</p>
<p>CPS.nnn = value</p>
<p>where <code>nnn</code> is a number.</p>
<p>userNotice qualifiers can be set using the syntax:</p>
<p>userNotice.nnn = @notice</p>
<p>The value of the userNotice qualifier is specified in the relevant
section. This section can include <strong>explicitText</strong>,
<strong>organization</strong>, and <strong>noticeNumbers</strong>
options. explicitText and organization are text strings, noticeNumbers
is a comma separated list of numbers. The organization and noticeNumbers
options (if included) must BOTH be present. Some software might require
the <strong>ia5org</strong> option at the top level; this changes the
encoding from Displaytext to IA5String.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>[extensions] certificatePolicies = ia5org, 1.2.3.4, 1.5.6.7.8,
@polsect [polsect] policyIdentifier = 1.3.5.8 CPS.1 =
"http://my.host.example.com/" CPS.2 = "http://my.your.example.com/"
userNotice.1 = @notice [notice] explicitText = "Explicit Text Here"
organization = "Organisation Name" noticeNumbers = 1, 2, 3, 4</p>
<p>The character encoding of explicitText can be specified by prefixing
the value with <strong>UTF8</strong>, <strong>BMP</strong>, or
<strong>VISIBLE</strong> followed by colon. For example:</p>
<p>[notice] explicitText = "UTF8:Explicit Text Here"</p>
<h2>Policy Constraints</h2>
<p>This is a multi-valued extension which consisting of the names
<strong>requireExplicitPolicy</strong> or
<strong>inhibitPolicyMapping</strong> and a non negative integer value.
At least one component must be present.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>policyConstraints = requireExplicitPolicy:3</p>
<h2>Inhibit Any Policy</h2>
<p>This is a string extension whose value must be a non negative
integer.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>inhibitAnyPolicy = 2</p>
<h2>Name Constraints</h2>
<p>This is a multi-valued extension. The name should begin with the word
<strong>permitted</strong> or <strong>excluded</strong> followed by a
<strong>;</strong>. The rest of the name and the value follows the
syntax of subjectAltName except <strong>email:copy</strong> is not
supported and the <strong>IP</strong> form should consist of an IP
addresses and subnet mask separated by a <strong>/</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>nameConstraints = permitted;IP:192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
nameConstraints = permitted;email:.example.com nameConstraints =
excluded;email:.com</p>
<h2>OCSP No Check</h2>
<p>This is a string extension. It is parsed, but ignored.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>noCheck = ignored</p>
<h2>TLS Feature (aka Must Staple)</h2>
<p>This is a multi-valued extension consisting of a list of TLS
extension identifiers. Each identifier may be a number (0..65535) or a
supported name. When a TLS client sends a listed extension, the TLS
server is expected to include that extension in its reply.</p>
<p>The supported names are: <strong>status_request</strong> and
<strong>status_request_v2</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>tlsfeature = status_request</p>
<h1>DEPRECATED EXTENSIONS</h1>
<p>The following extensions are non standard, Netscape specific and
largely obsolete. Their use in new applications is discouraged.</p>
<h2>Netscape String extensions</h2>
<p>Netscape Comment (<strong>nsComment</strong>) is a string extension
containing a comment which will be displayed when the certificate is
viewed in some browsers. Other extensions of this type are:
<strong>nsBaseUrl</strong>, <strong>nsRevocationUrl</strong>,
<strong>nsCaRevocationUrl</strong>, <strong>nsRenewalUrl</strong>,
<strong>nsCaPolicyUrl</strong> and <strong>nsSslServerName</strong>.</p>
<h2>Netscape Certificate Type</h2>
<p>This is a multi-valued extensions which consists of a list of flags
to be included. It was used to indicate the purposes for which a
certificate could be used. The basicConstraints, keyUsage and extended
key usage extensions are now used instead.</p>
<p>Acceptable values for nsCertType are: <strong>client</strong>,
<strong>server</strong>, <strong>email</strong>,
<strong>objsign</strong>, <strong>reserved</strong>,
<strong>sslCA</strong>, <strong>emailCA</strong>,
<strong>objCA</strong>.</p>
<h1>ARBITRARY EXTENSIONS</h1>
<p>If an extension is not supported by the OpenSSL code then it must be
encoded using the arbitrary extension format. It is also possible to use
the arbitrary format for supported extensions. Extreme care should be
taken to ensure that the data is formatted correctly for the given
extension type.</p>
<p>There are two ways to encode arbitrary extensions.</p>
<p>The first way is to use the word ASN1 followed by the extension
content using the same syntax as
<strong>ASN1_generate_nconf</strong> (3). For example:</p>
<p>[extensions] 1.2.3.4 = critical, ASN1:UTF8String:Some random data
1.2.3.4.1 = ASN1:SEQUENCE:seq_sect [seq_sect] field1 = UTF8:field1
field2 = UTF8:field2</p>
<p>It is also possible to use the word DER to include the raw encoded
data in any extension.</p>
<p>1.2.3.4 = critical, DER:01:02:03:04 1.2.3.4.1 = DER:01020304</p>
<p>The value following DER is a hex dump of the DER encoding of the
extension Any extension can be placed in this form to override the
default behaviour. For example:</p>
<p>basicConstraints = critical, DER:00:01:02:03</p>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p>There is no guarantee that a specific implementation will process a
given extension. It may therefore be sometimes possible to use
certificates for purposes prohibited by their extensions because a
specific application does not recognize or honour the values of the
relevant extensions.</p>
<p>The DER and ASN1 options should be used with caution. It is possible
to create invalid extensions if they are not used carefully.</p>
