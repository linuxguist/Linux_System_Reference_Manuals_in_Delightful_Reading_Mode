<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>org.freedesktop.import1 - The D-Bus interface of systemd-importd</p>
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-importd.service</strong>(8) is a system service which
may be used to import, export and download additional system images.
These images can be used by tools such as
<strong>systemd-nspawn</strong>(1) to run local containers. The service
is used as the backend for <strong>machinectl pull-raw</strong>,
<strong>machinectl pull-tar</strong> and related commands. This page
describes the D-Bus interface.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>systemd-importd.service</strong>(8) is mostly a
small companion service for
<strong>systemd-machined.service</strong>(8). Many operations to
manipulate local container and VM images are hence available via the
<strong>systemd-machined</strong> D-Bus API, c.f.
<strong>org.freedesktop.machine1</strong>(5).</p>
<h1>THE MANAGER OBJECT</h1>
<p>The service exposes the following interfaces on the Manager object on
the bus:</p>
<blockquote>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><strong>ImportTar()</strong> and <strong>ImportRaw()</strong> import
a system image and place it into /var/lib/machines/. The first argument
should be a file descriptor (opened for reading) referring to the tar or
raw file to import. It should reference a file on disk, a pipe or a
socket. When <strong>ImportTar()</strong> is used the file descriptor
should refer to a tar file, optionally compressed with
<strong>gzip</strong>(1), <strong>bzip2</strong>(1), or
<strong>xz</strong>(1). <strong>systemd-importd</strong> will detect the
used compression scheme (if any) automatically. When
<strong>ImportRaw()</strong> is used the file descriptor should refer to
a raw or qcow2 disk image containing an MBR or GPT disk label, also
optionally compressed with gzip, bzip2 or xz. In either case, if the
file is specified as a file descriptor on disk, progress information is
generated for the import operation (as in that case we know the total
size on disk). If a socket or pipe is specified, progress information is
not available. The file descriptor argument is followed by a local name
for the image. This should be a name suitable as a hostname and will be
used to name the imported image below /var/lib/machines/. A tar import
is placed as a directory tree or a <strong>btrfs</strong>(8) subvolume
below /var/lib/machines/ under the specified name with no suffix
appended. A raw import is placed as a file in /var/lib/machines/ with
the .raw suffix appended. If the <strong>force</strong> argument is
true, any pre-existing image with the same name is removed before
starting the operation. Otherwise, the operation fails if an image with
the same name already exists. Finally, the <strong>read_only</strong>
argument controls whether to create a writable or read-only image. Both
methods return immediately after starting the import, with the import
transfer ongoing. They return a pair of transfer identifier and object
path, which may be used to retrieve progress information about the
transfer or to cancel it. The transfer identifier is a simple numeric
identifier, the object path references an
org.freedesktop.import1.Transfer object, see below. Listen for a
<strong>TransferRemoved</strong> signal for the transfer ID in order to
detect when a transfer is complete. The returned transfer object is
useful to determine the current progress or log output of the ongoing
import operation.</p>
<p><strong>ExportTar()</strong> and <strong>ExportRaw()</strong>
implement the reverse operation, and may be used to export a system
image in order to place it in a tar or raw image. They take the machine
name to export as their first parameter, followed by a file descriptor
(opened for writing) where the tar or raw file will be written. It may
either reference a file on disk or a pipe/socket. The third argument
specifies in which compression format to write the image. It takes one
of "uncompressed", "xz", "bzip2" or "gzip", depending on which
compression scheme is required. The image written to the specified file
descriptor will be a tar file in case of <strong>ExportTar()</strong> or
a raw disk image in case of <strong>ExportRaw()</strong>. Note that
currently raw disk images may not be exported as tar files, and vice
versa. This restriction might be lifted eventually. The method returns a
transfer identifier and object path for cancelling or tracking the
export operation, similarly to <strong>ImportTar()</strong> or
<strong>ImportRaw()</strong> as described above.</p>
<p><strong>PullTar()</strong> and <strong>PullRaw()</strong> may be used
to download, verify and import a system image from a URL. They take an
URL argument which should point to a tar or raw file on the "http://" or
"https://" protocols, possibly compressed with xz, bzip2 or gzip. The
second argument is a local name for the image. It should be suitable as
a hostname, similarly to the matching argument of the
<strong>ImportTar()</strong> and <strong>ImportRaw()</strong> methods
above. The third argument indicates the verification mode for the image.
It may be one of "no", "checksum", "signature". "no" turns off any kind
of verification of the image; "checksum" looks for a SHA256SUM file next
to the downloaded image and verifies any SHA256 hash value in that file
against the image; "signature" does the same but also tries to
authenticate the SHA256SUM file via <strong>gpg</strong>(8) first. The
last argument indicates whether to replace a possibly pre-existing image
with the same local name (if "true"), or whether to fail (if "false").
Like the import and export calls above, these calls return a pair of
transfer identifier and object path for the ongoing download.</p>
<p><strong>ListTransfers()</strong> returns a list of ongoing import,
export or download operations as created with the six calls described
above. It returns an array of structures which consist of the numeric
transfer identifier, a string indicating the operation (one of
"import-tar", "import-raw", "export-tar", "export-raw", "pull-tar" or
"pull-raw"), a string describing the remote file (in case of download
operations this is the source URL, in case of import/export operations
this is a short string describing the file descriptor passed in), a
string with the local machine image name, a progress value between 0.0
(for 0%) and 1.0 (for 100%), as well as the transfer object path.</p>
<p><strong>CancelTransfer()</strong> may be used to cancel an ongoing
import, export or download operation. Simply specify the transfer
identifier to cancel the ongoing operation.</p>
<h2>Signals</h2>
<p>The <strong>TransferNew</strong> signal is generated each time a new
transfer is started with the import, export or download calls described
above. It carries the transfer ID and object path that have just been
created.</p>
<p>The <strong>TransferRemoved</strong> signal is sent each time a
transfer finishes, is canceled or fails. It also carries the transfer ID
and object path, followed by a string indicating the result of the
operation, which is one of "done" (on success), "canceled" or
"failed".</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The <strong>Cancel()</strong> method may be used to cancel the
transfer. It takes no parameters. This method is pretty much equivalent
to the <strong>CancelTransfer()</strong> method on the Manager interface
(see above), but is exposed on the Transfer object itself instead of
taking a transfer ID.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>The <em>Id</em> property exposes the numeric transfer ID of the
transfer object.</p>
<p>The <em>Local</em>, <em>Remote</em> and <em>Type</em> properties
expose the local container name of this transfer, the remote source (in
case of download: the URL, in case of import/export: a string describing
the file descriptor passed in), and the type of operation (see the
Managers <strong>ListTransfer()</strong> method above for an explanation
of the possible values).</p>
<p>The <em>Verify</em> property exposes the selected verification
setting and is only defined for download operations (see above).</p>
<p>The <em>Progress</em> property exposes the current progress of the
transfer as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. To show a progress bar on
screen we recommend to query this value in regular intervals, for
example every 500 ms or so.</p>
