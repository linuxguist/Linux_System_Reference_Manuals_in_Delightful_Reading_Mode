<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sources.list - List of configured APT data sources</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The source list /etc/apt/sources.list and the files contained in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ are designed to support any number of active
sources and a variety of source media. The files list one source per
line (one-line style) or contain multiline stanzas defining one or more
sources per stanza (deb822 style), with the most preferred source listed
first (in case a single version is available from more than one source).
The information available from the configured sources is acquired by
<strong>apt-get update</strong> (or by an equivalent command from
another APT front-end).</p>
<h1>SOURCES.LIST.D</h1>
<p>The /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory provides a way to add
sources.list entries in separate files. Two different file formats are
allowed as described in the next two sections. Filenames need to have
either the extension .list or .sources depending on the contained
format. The filenames may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits
(0-9), underscore (_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters. Otherwise
APT will print a notice that it has ignored a file, unless that file
matches a pattern in the Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list -
in which case it will be silently ignored.</p>
<h1>ONE-LINE-STYLE FORMAT</h1>
<p>Files in this format have the extension .list. Each line specifying a
source starts with a type (e.g. deb-src) followed by options and
arguments for this type. Individual entries cannot be continued onto a
following line. Empty lines are ignored, and a # character anywhere on a
line marks the remainder of that line as a comment. Consequently an
entry can be disabled by commenting out the entire line. If options
should be provided they are separated by spaces and all of them together
are enclosed by square brackets ([]) included in the line after the type
separated from it with a space. If an option allows multiple values
these are separated from each other with a comma (,). An option name is
separated from its value(s) by an equals sign (=). Multivalue options
also have -= and += as separators, which instead of replacing the
default with the given value(s) modify the default value(s) to remove or
include the given values.</p>
<p>This is the traditional format and supported by all apt versions.
Note that not all options as described below are supported by all apt
versions. Note also that some older applications parsing this format on
their own might not expect to encounter options as they were uncommon
before the introduction of multi-architecture support.</p>
<h1>DEB822-STYLE FORMAT</h1>
<p>Files in this format have the extension .sources. The format is
similar in syntax to other files used by Debian and its derivatives,
such as the metadata files that apt will download from the configured
sources or the debian/control file in a Debian source package.
Individual entries are separated by an empty line; additional empty
lines are ignored, and a # character at the start of the line marks the
entire line as a comment. An entry can hence be disabled by commenting
out each line belonging to the stanza, but it is usually easier to add
the field "Enabled: no" to the stanza to disable the entry. Removing the
field or setting it to yes re-enables it. Options have the same syntax
as every other field: A field name separated by a colon (:) and
optionally spaces from its value(s). Note especially that multiple
values are separated by whitespaces (like spaces, tabs and newlines),
not by commas as in the one-line format. Multivalue fields like
Architectures also have Architectures-Add and Architectures-Remove to
modify the default value rather than replacing it.</p>
<p>This is a new format supported by apt itself since version 1.1.
Previous versions ignore such files with a notice message as described
earlier. It is intended to make this format gradually the default
format, deprecating the previously described one-line-style format, as
it is easier to create, extend and modify for humans and machines alike
especially if a lot of sources and/or options are involved. Developers
who are working with and/or parsing apt sources are highly encouraged to
add support for this format and to contact the APT team to coordinate
and share this work. Users can freely adopt this format already, but may
encounter problems with software not supporting the format yet.</p>
<h1>THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: GENERAL FORMAT</h1>
<p>The deb type references a typical two-level Debian archive,
distribution/component. The distribution is generally a suite name like
stable or testing or a codename like bookworm or trixie while component
is one of main, contrib, non-free or non-free-firmware. The deb-src type
references a Debian distributions source code in the same form as the
deb type. A deb-src line is required to fetch source indexes.</p>
<p>The format for two one-line-style entries using the deb and deb-src
types is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>deb [ option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite [component1] [component2] [...]
deb-src [ option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite [component1] [component2] [...]</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively the equivalent entry in deb822 style looks like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>     Types: deb deb-src
     URIs: uri
     Suites: suite
     Components: [component1] [component2] [...]
     option1: value1
     option2: value2
   </code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The URI for the deb type must specify the base of the Debian
distribution, from which APT will find the information it needs. suite
can specify an exact path, in which case the components must be omitted
and suite must end with a slash (/). This is useful for the case when
only a particular sub-directory of the archive denoted by the URI is of
interest. If suite does not specify an exact path, at least one
component must be present.</p>
<p>suite may also contain a variable, $(ARCH) which expands to the
Debian architecture (such as amd64 or armel) used on the system. This
permits architecture-independent sources.list files to be used. In
general this is only of interest when specifying an exact path; APT will
automatically generate a URI with the current architecture
otherwise.</p>
<p>Especially in the one-line-style format since only one distribution
can be specified per line it may be necessary to have multiple lines for
the same URI, if a subset of all available distributions or components
at that location is desired. APT will sort the URI list after it has
generated a complete set internally, and will collapse multiple
references to the same Internet host, for instance, into a single
connection, so that it does not inefficiently establish a connection,
close it, do something else, and then re-establish a connection to that
same host. APT also parallelizes connections to different hosts to more
effectively deal with sites with low bandwidth.</p>
<p>It is important to list sources in order of preference, with the most
preferred source listed first. Typically this will result in sorting by
speed from fastest to slowest (CD-ROM followed by hosts on a local
network, followed by distant Internet hosts, for example).</p>
<p>As an example, the sources for your distribution could look like this
in one-line-style format:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or like this in deb822 style format:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Types: deb
URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian
Suites: bookworm bookworm-updates
Components: main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

Types: deb
URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian-security
Suites: bookworm-security
Components: main contrib non-free non-free-firmware</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Each source entry can have options specified to modify which source
is accessed and how data is acquired from it. Format, syntax and names
of the options vary between the one-line-style and deb822-style formats
as described, but they both have the same options available. For
simplicity we list the deb822 field name and provide the one-line name
in brackets. Remember that besides setting multivalue options
explicitly, there is also the option to modify them based on the
default, but we arent listing those names explicitly here. Unsupported
options are silently ignored by all APT versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Architectures</strong> (<strong>arch</strong>) is a
multivalue option defining for which architectures information should be
downloaded. If this option isnt set the default is all architectures as
defined by the <strong>APT::Architectures</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Languages</strong> (<strong>lang</strong>) is a multivalue
option defining for which languages information such as translated
package descriptions should be downloaded. If this option isnt set the
default is all languages as defined by the
<strong>Acquire::Languages</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong> (<strong>target</strong>) is a multivalue
option defining which download targets apt will try to acquire from this
source. If not specified, the default set is defined by the
<strong>Acquire::IndexTargets</strong> configuration scope (targets are
specified by their name in the Created-By field). Additionally, targets
can be enabled or disabled by using the Identifier field as an option
with a boolean value instead of using this multivalue option.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>PDiffs</strong> (<strong>pdiffs</strong>) is a yes/no value
which controls if APT should try to use PDiffs to update old indexes
instead of downloading the new indexes entirely. The value of this
option is ignored if the repository doesnt announce the availability of
PDiffs. Defaults to the value of the option with the same name for a
specific index file defined in the
<strong>Acquire::IndexTargets</strong> scope, which itself defaults to
the value of configuration option <strong>Acquire::PDiffs</strong> which
defaults to yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>By-Hash</strong> (<strong>by-hash</strong>) can have the
value yes, no or force and controls if APT should try to acquire indexes
via a URI constructed from a hashsum of the expected file instead of
using the well-known stable filename of the index. Using this can avoid
hashsum mismatches, but requires a supporting mirror. A yes or no value
activates/disables the use of this feature if this source indicates
support for it, while force will enable the feature regardless of what
the source indicates. Defaults to the value of the option of the same
name for a specific index file defined in the
<strong>Acquire::IndexTargets</strong> scope, which itself defaults to
the value of configuration option <strong>Acquire::By-Hash</strong>
which defaults to yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, there are options which if set affect <em>all</em>
sources with the same URI and Suite, so they have to be set on all such
entries and can not be varied between different components. APT will try
to detect and error out on such anomalies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Allow-Insecure</strong> (<strong>allow-insecure</strong>),
<strong>Allow-Weak</strong> (<strong>allow-weak</strong>) and
<strong>Allow-Downgrade-To-Insecure</strong>
(<strong>allow-downgrade-to-insecure</strong>) are boolean values which
all default to no. If set to yes they circumvent parts of
<strong>apt-secure</strong>(8) and should therefore not be used
lightly!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Trusted</strong> (<strong>trusted</strong>) is a tri-state
value which defaults to APT deciding if a source is considered trusted
or if warnings should be raised before e.g. packages are installed from
this source. This option can be used to override that decision. The
value yes tells APT always to consider this source as trusted, even if
it doesnt pass authentication checks. It disables parts of
<strong>apt-secure</strong>(8), and should therefore only be used in a
local and trusted context (if at all) as otherwise security is breached.
The value no does the opposite, causing the source to be handled as
untrusted even if the authentication checks passed successfully. The
default value cant be set explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Signed-By</strong> (<strong>signed-by</strong>) is an option
to require a repository to pass <strong>apt-secure</strong>(8)
verification with a certain set of keys rather than all trusted keys apt
has configured. It is specified as a list of absolute paths to keyring
files (have to be accessible and readable for the _apt system user, so
ensure everyone has read-permissions on the file) and fingerprints of
keys to select from these keyrings. The recommended locations for
keyrings are /usr/share/keyrings for keyrings managed by packages, and
/etc/apt/keyrings for keyrings managed by the system operator. If no
keyring files are specified the default is the trusted.gpg keyring and
all keyrings in the trusted.gpg.d/ directory (see <strong>apt-key
fingerprint</strong>). If no fingerprint is specified all keys in the
keyrings are selected. A fingerprint will accept also all signatures by
a subkey of this key, if this isnt desired an exclamation mark (!) can
be appended to the fingerprint to disable this behaviour. The option
defaults to the value of the option with the same name if set in the
previously acquired Release file of this repository (only fingerprints
can be specified there through). Otherwise all keys in the trusted
keyrings are considered valid signers for this repository. The option
may also be set directly to an embedded GPG public key block. Special
care is needed to encode the empty line with leading spaces and ".":</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Check-Valid-Until</strong>
(<strong>check-valid-until</strong>) is a yes/no value which controls if
APT should try to detect replay attacks. A repository creator can
declare a time until which the data provided in the repository should be
considered valid, and if this time is reached, but no new data is
provided, the data is considered expired and an error is raised. Besides
increasing security, as a malicious attacker cant send old data forever
to prevent a user from upgrading to a new version, this also helps users
identify mirrors which are no longer updated. However, some repositories
such as historic archives are not updated any more by design, so this
check can be disabled by setting this option to no. Defaults to the
value of configuration option
<strong>Acquire::Check-Valid-Until</strong> which itself defaults to
yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Valid-Until-Min</strong> (<strong>valid-until-min</strong>)
and <strong>Valid-Until-Max</strong> (<strong>valid-until-max</strong>)
can be used to raise or lower the time period in seconds in which the
data from this repository is considered valid. -Max can be especially
useful if the repository provides no Valid-Until field on its Release
file to set your own value, while -Min can be used to increase the valid
time on seldom updated (local) mirrors of a more frequently updated but
less accessible archive (which is in the sources.list as well) instead
of disabling the check entirely. Default to the value of the
configuration options <strong>Acquire::Min-ValidTime</strong> and
<strong>Acquire::Max-ValidTime</strong> which are both unset by
default.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Check-Date</strong> (<strong>check-date</strong>) is a yes/no
value which controls if APT should consider the machines time correct
and hence perform time related checks, such as verifying that a Release
file is not from the future. Disabling it also disables the
<strong>Check-Valid-Until</strong> option mentioned above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>Date-Max-Future</strong> (<strong>date-max-future</strong>)
controls how far from the future a repository may be. Default to the
value of the configuration option
<strong>Acquire::Max-FutureTime</strong> which is 10 seconds by
default.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p><strong>InRelease-Path</strong> (<strong>inrelease-path</strong>)
determines the path to the InRelease file, relative to the normal
position of an InRelease file. By default, this option is unset and APT
will try to fetch an InRelease or, if that fails, a Release file and its
associated Release.gpg file. By setting this option, the specified path
will be tried instead of the InRelease file, and the fallback to Release
files will be disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>URI SPECIFICATION</h1>
<p>The currently recognized URI types are:</p>
<p><strong>http</strong> (<strong>apt-transport-http</strong>(1))</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The http scheme specifies an HTTP server for an archive and is the
most commonly used method. The URI can directly include login
information if the archive requires it, but the use of
<strong>apt_auth.conf</strong>(5) should be preferred. The method also
supports SOCKS5 and HTTP(S) proxies either configured via apt-specific
configuration or specified by the environment variable
<strong>http_proxy</strong> in the format (assuming an HTTP proxy
requiring authentication) <em>http://user:pass@server:port/</em>. The
authentication details for proxies can also be supplied via
<strong>apt_auth.conf</strong>(5).</p>
<p>Note that these forms of authentication are insecure as the whole
communication with the remote server (or proxy) is not encrypted so a
sufficiently capable attacker can observe and record login as well as
all other interactions. The attacker can <em>not</em> modify the
communication through as APTs data security model is independent of the
chosen transport method. See <strong>apt-secure</strong>(8) for
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>https</strong> (<strong>apt-transport-https</strong>(1))</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The https scheme specifies an HTTPS server for an archive and is very
similar in use and available options to the http scheme. The main
difference is that the communication between apt and server (or proxy)
is encrypted. Note that the encryption does not prevent an attacker from
knowing which server (or proxy) apt is communicating with and deeper
analysis can potentially still reveal which data was downloaded. If this
is a concern the Tor-based schemes mentioned further below might be a
suitable alternative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>, <strong>mirror+</strong><em>scheme</em>
(<strong>apt-transport-mirror</strong>(1))</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mirror scheme specifies the location of a mirrorlist. By default
the scheme used for the location is http, but any other scheme can be
used via <strong>mirror+</strong><em>scheme</em>. The mirrorlist itself
can contain many different URIs for mirrors the APT client can
transparently pick, choose and fallback between intended to help both
with distributing the load over the available mirrors and ensuring that
clients can acquire data even if some configured mirrors are not
available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>file</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The file scheme allows an arbitrary directory in the file system to
be considered an archive. This is useful for NFS mounts and local
mirrors or archives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>cdrom</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cdrom scheme allows APT to use a local CD-ROM, DVD or USB drive
with media swapping. Use the <strong>apt-cdrom</strong>(8) program to
create cdrom entries in the source list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ftp</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ftp scheme specifies an FTP server for an archive. Use of FTP is
on the decline in favour of http and https and many archives either
never offered or are retiring FTP access. If you still need this method
many configuration options for it are available in the Acquire::ftp
scope and detailed in <strong>apt.conf</strong>(5).</p>
<p>Please note that an FTP proxy can be specified by using the
<strong>ftp_proxy</strong> environment variable. It is possible to
specify an HTTP proxy (HTTP proxy servers often understand FTP URLs)
using this environment variable and <em>only</em> this environment
variable. Proxies using HTTP specified in the configuration file will be
ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>copy</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The copy scheme is identical to the file scheme except that packages
are copied into the cache directory instead of used directly at their
location. This is useful for people using removable media to copy files
around with APT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>rsh</strong>, <strong>ssh</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rsh/ssh method invokes RSH/SSH to connect to a remote host and
access the files as a given user. Prior configuration of rhosts or RSA
keys is recommended. The standard <strong>find</strong> and
<strong>dd</strong> commands are used to perform the file transfers from
the remote host.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>adding more recognizable URI types</p>
<blockquote>
<p>APT can be extended with more methods shipped in other optional
packages, which should follow the naming scheme
apt-transport-<em>method</em>. For instance, the APT team also maintains
the package apt-transport-tor, which provides access methods for HTTP
and HTTPS URIs routed via the Tor network.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Uses the archive stored locally (or NFS mounted) at /home/apt/debian
for stable/main, stable/contrib, stable/non-free and
