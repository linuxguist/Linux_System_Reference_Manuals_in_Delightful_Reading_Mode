<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>american-english - a list of English words</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>/usr/share/dict/american-english</strong> is an ASCII file
which contains an alphabetic list of words, one per line.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>There may be any number of word lists in /usr/share/dict/.
<em>/etc/dictionaries-common/words</em> is a symbolic link to the
currently-chosen <em>/usr/share/dict/&lt;language&gt;</em> file.
<em>/usr/share/dict/words</em> is a symbolic link to
<em>/etc/dictionaries-common/words</em>, and is the name by which other
software should refer to the system word list. See
<strong>select-default-wordlist</strong>(8) for more information, and/or
to change the currently-chosen word list.</p>
<p>The directory <em>/usr/share/dict</em> can contain word lists for
many languages, with name of the language in English, e.g.,
<em>/usr/share/dict/french</em> and <em>/usr/share/dict/danish</em>
contain respectively lists of French and Danish words if they exist.
Such lists should be coded using the ISO 8859-1 character set
encoding.</p>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>
<p><strong>ispell</strong>(1),
<strong>select-default-wordlist</strong>(8), and the <em>Filesystem
Hierarchy</em> <em>Standard</em>.</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The words lists are not specific, and may be generated from any
number of sources.</p>
<p>The system word list used to be <em>/usr/dict/words</em>. For
compatibility, software should check that location if
<em>/usr/share/dict/words</em> does not exist.</p>
<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
<p>Word lists are collected and maintained by various authors. The
Debian English word lists are built from the SCOWL (Spell- Checker
Oriented Word Lists) package, whose upstream editor is Kevin Atkinson
&lt;kevina@users.sourceforge.net&gt;.</p>
