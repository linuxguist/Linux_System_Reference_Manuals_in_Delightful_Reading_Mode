<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-sp15c - SANE backend for Fujitsu ScanPartner 15C flatbed
scanner</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-sp15c</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to the Fujitsu flatbed
scanners. At present, the following scanner is known to work with these
backend:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Vendor:  Model:           Rev:
-------- ---------------- -----
FCPA     ScanPartner 15C  1.01</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The ScanPartner 15C driver supports lineart (1-bit), halftone
(1-bit), grayscale (4-bit and 8-bit), and color (3 x 8-bit)
scanning.</p>
<p>Other scanners in these families may work. The ScanPartner 15C seems
to be a repackaging of the ScanPartner 600C. People are encouraged to
try these driver with the other scanners and to contact the author with
test results.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>A modest effort has been made to expose the standard options to the
API. This allows frontends such as <strong>xscanimage</strong>(1) to set
scanning region, resolution, bit-depth (and color), and enable the
automatic document feeder.</p>

<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
<p>Randolph Bentson &lt;<em>bentson@holmsjoen.com</em>&gt;, with credit
to the unnamed author of the coolscan driver</p>
<h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
<p>Testing limited to a Linux 2.2.5 kernel<br />
Can't quite get the scan page/minute performance in ADF modes. This may
be due to limited system buffer size.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>I'm sure there are plenty, and not too well hidden, but I haven't
seen them yet.<br />
Both scanners claim to have separate control of resolution in X and Y
directions. I confess I haven't tested this yet. I have found that
<strong>xsane</strong>(1) doesn't even display this capability.<br />
Threshold settings on the SP15C don't seem to affect the results of
lineart mode scans.<br />
It might be possible to merge these two drivers without much effort
since the SP15C driver was derived from the M3096G driver. They were
split so as to keep the second driver development from breaking the
working first driver. Watch this space for changes.</p>
