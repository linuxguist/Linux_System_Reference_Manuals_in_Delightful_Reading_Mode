<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>udev.conf - Configuration for device event managing daemon</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/udev/udev.conf</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-udevd</strong>(8) expects its main configuration file
at /etc/udev/udev.conf. It consists of a set of variables allowing the
user to override default udev values. All empty lines or lines beginning
with # are ignored. The following variables can be set:</p>
<p><em>udev_log=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The log level. Valid values are the numerical syslog priorities or
their textual representations: <strong>err</strong>,
<strong>info</strong> and <strong>debug</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>children_max=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer. The maximum number of events executed in parallel.</p>
<p>This is the same as the <strong>--children-max=</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>exec_delay=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer. Delay the execution of each <em>RUN{program}</em>
parameter by the given number of seconds. This option might be useful
when debugging system crashes during coldplug caused by loading
non-working kernel modules.</p>
<p>This is the same as the <strong>--exec-delay=</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>event_timeout=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer. The number of seconds to wait for events to finish. After
this time, the event will be terminated. The default is 180 seconds.</p>
<p>This is the same as the <strong>--event-timeout=</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>resolve_names=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies when systemd-udevd should resolve names of users and
groups. When set to <strong>early</strong> (the default), names will be
resolved when the rules are parsed. When set to <strong>late</strong>,
names will be resolved for every event. When set to
<strong>never</strong>, names will never be resolved and all devices
will be owned by root.</p>
<p>This is the same as the <strong>--resolve-names=</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>timeout_signal=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a signal that systemd-udevd will send on worker timeouts.
Note that both workers and spawned processes will be killed using this
signal. Defaults to <strong>SIGKILL</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, systemd-udevd can be configured by command line options
and the kernel command line (see <strong>systemd-udevd</strong>(8)).</p>
