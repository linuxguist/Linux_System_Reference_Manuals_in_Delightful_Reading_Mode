<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>crontab - tables for driving cron</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A <em>crontab</em> file contains instructions to the <em>cron</em>(8)
daemon of the general form: ``run this command at this time on this
date''. Each user has their own crontab, and commands in any given
crontab will be executed as the user who owns the crontab. Uucp and News
will usually have their own crontabs, eliminating the need for
explicitly running <em>su</em>(1) as part of a cron command.</p>
<p>Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored. Lines whose
first non-space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments, and are
ignored. Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as cron
commands, since they will be taken to be part of the command. Similarly,
comments are not allowed on the same line as environment variable
settings.</p>
<p>An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or
a cron command. An environment setting is of the form,</p>
<p>name = value</p>
<p>where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any
subsequent non-leading spaces in <em>value</em> will be part of the
value assigned to <em>name</em>. The <em>value</em> string may be placed
in quotes (single or double, but matching) to preserve leading or
trailing blanks.</p>
<p>Several environment variables are set up automatically by the
<em>cron</em>(8) daemon. SHELL is set to /bin/sh, and LOGNAME and HOME
are set from the /etc/passwd line of the crontab's owner. HOME and SHELL
may be overridden by settings in the crontab; LOGNAME may not.</p>
<p>(Another note: the LOGNAME variable is sometimes called USER on BSD
systems... on these systems, USER will be set also.)</p>
<p>In addition to LOGNAME, HOME, and SHELL, <em>cron</em>(8) will look
at MAILTO if it has any reason to send mail as a result of running
commands in ``this'' crontab. If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty), mail
is sent to the user so named. If MAILTO is defined but empty
(MAILTO=""), no mail will be sent. Otherwise mail is sent to the owner
of the crontab. This option is useful if you decide on /bin/mail instead
of /usr/lib/sendmail as your mailer when you install cron -- /bin/mail
doesn't do aliasing, and UUCP usually doesn't read its mail.</p>
<p>The format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard, with a
number of upward-compatible extensions. Each line has five time and date
fields, followed by a user name if this is the system crontab file,
followed by a command. Commands are executed by <em>cron</em>(8) when
the minute, hour, and month of year fields match the current time,
<em>and</em> when at least one of the two day fields (day of month, or
day of week) match the current time (see ``Note'' below).
<em>cron</em>(8) examines cron entries once every minute. The time and
date fields are:</p>
<p>field allowed values<br />
----- --------------<br />
minute 0-59<br />
hour 0-23<br />
day of month 0-31<br />
month 0-12 (or names, see below)<br />
day of week 0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)<br />
</p>
<p>A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for
``first-last''.</p>
<p>Ranges of numbers are allowed. Ranges are two numbers separated with
a hyphen. The specified range is inclusive. For example, 8-11 for an
``hours'' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.</p>
<p>Lists are allowed. A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated
by commas. Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0-4,8-12''.</p>
<p>Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range
with ``/&lt;number&gt;'' specifies skips of the number's value through
the range. For example, ``0-23/2'' can be used in the hours field to
specify command execution every other hour (the alternative in the V7
standard is ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22''). Steps are also
permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say ``every two hours'',
just use ``*/2''.</p>
<p>Names can also be used for the ``month'' and ``day of week'' fields.
Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case doesn't
matter). Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.</p>
<p>The ``sixth'' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to
be run. The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or %
character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the
SHELL variable of the cronfile. Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless
escaped with backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters, and
all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard
input.</p>
<p>Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields
â€” day of month, and day of week. If both fields are restricted (ie,
aren't *), the command will be run when <em>either</em> field matches
the current time. For example,<br />
``30 4 1,15 * 5'' would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st
and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLE CRON FILE</h1>
<pre><code>
# use /bin/sh to run commands, no matter what /etc/passwd says
SHELL=/bin/sh
# mail any output to `paul&#39;, no matter whose crontab this is
MAILTO=paul
#
# run five minutes after midnight, every day
5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job &gt;&gt; $HOME/tmp/out 2&gt;&amp;1
# run at 2:15pm on the first of every month -- output mailed to paul
15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
# run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
0 22 * * 1-5	mail -s &quot;It&#39;s 10pm&quot; joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
23 0-23/2 * * * echo &quot;run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday&quot;
5 4 * * sun     echo &quot;run at 5 after 4 every sunday&quot;
# Run once every 9th day, even across week, month, and year boundaries:
33 22 * * *     expr $(date +s) / 60 / 60 / 24  9 &gt; /dev/null || echo Wax the floor.</code></pre>

<h1>EXTENSIONS</h1>
<p>When specifying day of week, both day 0 and day 7 will be considered
Sunday. BSD and ATT seem to disagree about this.</p>
<p>Lists and ranges are allowed to co-exist in the same field. "1-3,7-9"
would be rejected by ATT or BSD cron -- they want to see "1-3" or
"7,8,9" ONLY.</p>
<p>Ranges can include "steps", so "1-9/2" is the same as
"1,3,5,7,9".</p>
<p>Names of months or days of the week can be specified by name.</p>
<p>Environment variables can be set in the crontab. In BSD or ATT, the
environment handed to child processes is basically the one from
/etc/rc.</p>
<p>Command output is mailed to the crontab owner (BSD can't do this),
can be mailed to a person other than the crontab owner (SysV can't do
this), or the feature can be turned off and no mail will be sent at all
(SysV can't do this either).</p>
