<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>veritytab - Configuration for verity block devices</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/veritytab</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The /etc/veritytab file describes verity protected block devices that
are set up during system boot.</p>
<p>Empty lines and lines starting with the "#" character are ignored.
Each of the remaining lines describes one verity protected block device.
Fields are delimited by white space.</p>
<p>Each line is in the form</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>volume-name data-device hash-device roothash options</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first four fields are mandatory, the remaining one is
optional.</p>
<p>The first field contains the name of the resulting verity volume; its
block device is set up below /dev/mapper/.</p>
<p>The second field contains a path to the underlying block data device,
or a specification of a block device via "UUID=" followed by the
UUID.</p>
<p>The third field contains a path to the underlying block hash device,
or a specification of a block device via "UUID=" followed by the
UUID.</p>
<p>The fourth field is the "roothash" in hexadecimal.</p>
<p>The fifth field, if present, is a comma-delimited list of options.
The following options are recognized:</p>
<p><strong>ignore-corruption</strong>,
<strong>restart-on-corruption</strong>,
<strong>panic-on-corruption</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines what to do if a data verity problem is detected (data
corruption). Without these options kernel fails the IO operation with
I/O error. With "--ignore-corruption" option the corruption is only
logged. With "--restart-on-corruption" or "--panic-on-corruption" the
kernel is restarted (panicked) immediately. (You have to provide way how
to avoid restart loops.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ignore-zero-blocks</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instruct kernel to not verify blocks that are expected to contain
zeroes and always directly return zeroes instead. WARNING: Use this
option only in very specific cases. This option is available since Linux
kernel version 4.5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>check-at-most-once</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instruct kernel to verify blocks only the first time they are read
from the data device, rather than every time. WARNING: It provides a
reduced level of security because only offline tampering of the data
devices content will be detected, not online tampering. This option is
available since Linux kernel version 4.17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>root-hash-signature=</strong><em>PATH</em><strong>|base64:</strong><em>HEX</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A base64 string encoding the root hash signature prefixed by
"base64:" or a path to roothash signature file used to verify the root
hash (in kernel). This feature requires Linux kernel version 5.4 or more
recent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>_netdev</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marks this veritysetup device as requiring network. It will be
started after the network is available, similarly to
<strong>systemd.mount</strong>(5) units marked with
<strong>_netdev</strong>. The service unit to set up this device will be
ordered between remote-fs-pre.target and remote-veritysetup.target,
instead of veritysetup-pre.target and veritysetup.target.</p>
<p>Hint: if this device is used for a mount point that is specified in
<strong>fstab</strong>(5), the <strong>_netdev</strong> option should
also be used for the mount point. Otherwise, a dependency loop might be
created where the mount point will be pulled in by local-fs.target,
while the service to configure the network is usually only started
<em>after</em> the local file system has been mounted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>noauto</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This device will not be added to veritysetup.target. This means that
it will not be automatically enabled on boot, unless something else
pulls it in. In particular, if the device is used for a mount point,
itll be enabled automatically during boot, unless the mount point itself
is also disabled with <strong>noauto</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nofail</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This device will not be a hard dependency of veritysetup.target. Itll
still be pulled in and started, but the system will not wait for the
device to show up and be enabled, and boot will not fail if this is
unsuccessful. Note that other units that depend on the enabled device
may still fail. In particular, if the device is used for a mount point,
the mount point itself also needs to have the <strong>nofail</strong>
option, or the boot will fail if the device is not enabled
successfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>x-initrd.attach</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setup this verity protected block device in the initrd, similarly to
<strong>systemd.mount</strong>(5) units marked with
<strong>x-initrd.mount</strong>.</p>
<p>Although its not necessary to mark the mount entry for the root file
system with <strong>x-initrd.mount</strong>,
<strong>x-initrd.attach</strong> is still recommended with the verity
protected block device containing the root file system as otherwise
systemd will attempt to detach the device during the regular system
shutdown while its still in use. With this option the device will still
be detached but later after the root file system is unmounted.</p>
<p>All other verity protected block devices that contain file systems
mounted in the initrd should use this option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At early boot and when the system manager configuration is reloaded,
this file is translated into native systemd units by
<strong>systemd-veritysetup-generator</strong>(8).</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>Example 1. /etc/veritytab example</strong></p>
<p>Set up two verity protected block devices. One using device blocks,
another using files.</p>
