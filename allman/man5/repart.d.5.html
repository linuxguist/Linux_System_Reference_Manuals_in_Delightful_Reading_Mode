<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>repart.d - Partition Definition Files for Automatic Boot-Time
Repartitioning</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>/etc/repart.d/*.conf
/run/repart.d/*.conf
/usr/lib/repart.d/*.conf
    </code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>repart.d/*.conf files describe basic properties of partitions of
block devices of the local system. They may be used to declare types,
names and sizes of partitions that shall exist. The
<strong>systemd-repart</strong>(8) service reads these files and
attempts to add new partitions currently missing and enlarge existing
partitions according to these definitions. Operation is generally
incremental, i.e. when applied, what exists already is left intact, and
partitions are never shrunk, moved or deleted.</p>
<p>These definition files are useful for implementing operating system
images that are prepared and delivered with minimally sized images (for
example lacking any state or swap partitions), and which on first boot
automatically take possession of any remaining disk space following a
few basic rules.</p>
<p>Currently, support for partition definition files is only implemented
for GPT partitition tables.</p>
<p>Partition files are generally matched against any partitions already
existing on disk in a simple algorithm: the partition files are sorted
by their filename (ignoring the directory prefix), and then compared in
order against existing partitions matching the same partition type UUID.
Specifically, the first existing partition with a specific partition
type UUID is assigned the first definition file with the same partition
type UUID, and the second existing partition with a specific type UUID
the second partition file with the same type UUID, and so on. Any
left-over partition files that have no matching existing partition are
assumed to define new partition that shall be created. Such partitions
are appended to the end of the partition table, in the order defined by
their names utilizing the first partition slot greater than the highest
slot number currently in use. Any existing partitions that have no
matching partition file are left as they are.</p>
<p>Note that these definitions may only be used to create and initialize
new partitions or to grow existing ones. In the latter case it will not
grow the contained files systems however; separate mechanisms, such as
<strong>systemd-growfs</strong>(8) may be used to grow the file systems
inside of these partitions. Partitions may also be marked for automatic
growing via the <em>GrowFileSystem=</em> setting, in which case the file
system is grown on first mount by tools that respect this flag. See
below for details.</p>

<p>This setting defaults to <strong>linux-generic</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of the partition type UUIDs listed above are defined in the
<strong>Discoverable Partitions Specification</strong>[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Label=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The textual label to assign to the partition if none is assigned yet.
Note that this setting is not used for matching. It is also not used
when a label is already set for an existing partition. It is thus only
used when a partition is newly created or when an existing one had a no
label set (that is: an empty label). If not specified a label derived
from the partition type is automatically used. Simple specifier
expansion is supported, see below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>UUID=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UUID to assign to the partition if none is assigned yet. Note
that this setting is not used for matching. It is also not used when a
UUID is already set for an existing partition. It is thus only used when
a partition is newly created or when an existing one had a all-zero UUID
set. If set to "null", the UUID is set to all zeroes. If not specified a
UUID derived from the partition type is automatically used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Priority=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A numeric priority to assign to this partition, in the range
-2147483648...2147483647, with smaller values indicating higher
priority, and higher values indicating smaller priority. This priority
is used in case the configured size constraints on the defined
partitions do not permit fitting all partitions onto the available disk
space. If the partitions do not fit, the highest numeric partition
priority of all defined partitions is determined, and all defined
partitions with this priority are removed from the list of new
partitions to create (which may be multiple, if the same priority is
used for multiple partitions). The fitting algorithm is then tried
again. If the partitions still do not fit, the now highest numeric
partition priority is determined, and the matching partitions removed
too, and so on. Partitions of a priority of 0 or lower are never
removed. If all partitions with a priority above 0 are removed and the
partitions still do not fit on the device the operation fails. Note that
this priority has no effect on ordering partitions, for that use the
alphabetical order of the filenames of the partition definition files.
Defaults to 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Weight=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A numeric weight to assign to this partition in the range
0...1000000. Available disk space is assigned the defined partitions
according to their relative weights (subject to the size constraints
configured with <em>SizeMinBytes=</em>, <em>SizeMaxBytes=</em>), so that
a partition with weight 2000 gets double the space as one with weight
1000, and a partition with weight 333 a third of that. Defaults to
1000.</p>
<p>The <em>Weight=</em> setting is used to distribute available disk
space in an "elastic" fashion, based on the disk size and existing
partitions. If a partition shall have a fixed size use both
<em>SizeMinBytes=</em> and <em>SizeMaxBytes=</em> with the same value in
order to fixate the size to one value, in which case the weight has no
effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PaddingWeight=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <em>Weight=</em>, but sets a weight for the free space
after the partition (the "padding"). When distributing available space
the weights of all partitions and all defined padding is summed, and
then each partition and padding gets the fraction defined by its weight.
Defaults to 0, i.e. by default no padding is applied.</p>
<p>Padding is useful if empty space shall be left for later additions or
a safety margin at the end of the device or between partitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SizeMinBytes=</em>, <em>SizeMaxBytes=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies minimum and maximum size constraints in bytes. Takes the
usual K, M, G, T, ... suffixes (to the base of 1024). If
<em>SizeMinBytes=</em> is specified the partition is created at or grown
to at least the specified size. If <em>SizeMaxBytes=</em> is specified
the partition is created at or grown to at most the specified size. The
precise size is determined through the weight value configured with
<em>Weight=</em>, see above. When <em>SizeMinBytes=</em> is set equal to
<em>SizeMaxBytes=</em> the configured weight has no effect as the
partition is explicitly sized to the specified fixed value. Note that
partitions are never created smaller than 4096 bytes, and since
partitions are never shrunk the previous size of the partition (in case
the partition already exists) is also enforced as lower bound for the
new size. The values should be specified as multiples of 4096 bytes, and
are rounded upwards (in case of <em>SizeMinBytes=</em>) or downwards (in
case of <em>SizeMaxBytes=</em>) otherwise. If the backing device does
not provide enough space to fulfill the constraints placing the
partition will fail. For partitions that shall be created, depending on
the setting of <em>Priority=</em> (see above) the partition might be
dropped and the placing algorithm restarted. By default a minimum size
constraint of 10M and no maximum size constraint is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PaddingMinBytes=</em>, <em>PaddingMaxBytes=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies minimum and maximum size constraints in bytes for the free
space after the partition (the "padding"). Semantics are similar to
<em>SizeMinBytes=</em> and <em>SizeMaxBytes=</em>, except that unlike
partition sizes free space can be shrunk and can be as small as zero. By
default no size constraints on padding are set, so that only
<em>PaddingWeight=</em> determines the size of the padding applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CopyBlocks=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a regular file, block device node or directory, or
the special value "auto". If specified and the partition is newly
created, the data from the specified path is written to the newly
created partition, on the block level. If a directory is specified, the
backing block device of the file system the directory is on is
determined, and the data read directly from that. This option is useful
to efficiently replicate existing file systems onto new partitions on
the block level — for example to build a simple OS installer or an OS
image builder.</p>
<p>If the special value "auto" is specified, the source to copy from is
automatically picked up from the running system (or the image specified
with <strong>--image=</strong> — if used). A partition that matches both
the configured partition type (as declared with <em>Type=</em> described
above), and the currently mounted directory appropriate for that
partition type is determined. For example, if the partition type is set
to "root" the partition backing the root directory (/) is used as source
to copy from — if its partition type is set to "root" as well. If the
declared type is "usr" the partition backing /usr/ is used as source to
copy blocks from — if its partition type is set to "usr" too. The logic
is capable of automatically tracking down the backing partitions for
encrypted and Verity-enabled volumes. "CopyBlocks=auto" is useful for
implementing "self-replicating" systems, i.e. systems that are their own
installer.</p>
<p>The file specified here must have a size that is a multiple of the
basic block size 512 and not be empty. If this option is used, the size
allocation algorithm is slightly altered: the partition is created as
least as big as required to fit the data in, i.e. the data size is an
additional minimum size value taken into consideration for the
allocation algorithm, similar to and in addition to the
<em>SizeMin=</em> value configured above.</p>
<p>This option has no effect if the partition it is declared for already
exists, i.e. existing data is never overwritten. Note that the data is
copied in before the partition table is updated, i.e. before the
partition actually is persistently created. This provides robustness: it
is guaranteed that the partition either doesnt exist or exists fully
populated; it is not possible that the partition exists but is not or
only partially populated.</p>
<p>This option cannot be combined with <em>Format=</em> or
<em>CopyFiles=</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Format=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a file system name, such as "ext4", "btrfs", "xfs", "vfat",
"squashfs", or the special value "swap". If specified and the partition
is newly created it is formatted with the specified file system (or as
swap device). The file system UUID and label are automatically derived
from the partition UUID and label. If this option is used, the size
allocation algorithm is slightly altered: the partition is created as
least as big as required for the minimal file system of the specified
type (or 4KiB if the minimal size is not known).</p>
<p>This option has no effect if the partition already exists.</p>
<p>Similarly to the behaviour of <em>CopyBlocks=</em>, the file system
is formatted before the partition is created, ensuring that the
partition only ever exists with a fully initialized file system.</p>
<p>This option cannot be combined with <em>CopyBlocks=</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CopyFiles=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a pair of colon separated absolute file system paths. The first
path refers to a source file or directory on the host, the second path
refers to a target in the file system of the newly created partition and
formatted file system. This setting may be used to copy files or
directories from the host into the file system that is created due to
the <em>Format=</em> option. If <em>CopyFiles=</em> is used without
<em>Format=</em> specified explicitly, "Format=" with a suitable default
is implied (currently "ext4", but this may change in the future). This
option may be used multiple times to copy multiple files or directories
from host into the newly formatted file system. The colon and second
path may be omitted in which case the source path is also used as the
target path (relative to the root of the newly created file system). If
the source path refers to a directory it is copied recursively.</p>
<p>This option has no effect if the partition already exists: it cannot
be used to copy additional files into an existing partition, it may only
be used to populate a file system created anew.</p>
<p>The copy operation is executed before the file system is registered
in the partition table, thus ensuring that a file system populated this
way only ever exists fully initialized.</p>
<p>This option cannot be combined with <em>CopyBlocks=</em>.</p>
<p>When <strong>systemd-repart</strong> is invoked with the
<strong>--image=</strong> or <strong>--root=</strong> command line
switches the source paths specified are taken relative to the specified
root directory or disk image root.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>MakeDirectories=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes one or more absolute paths, separated by whitespace, each
declaring a directory to create within the new file system. Behaviour is
similar to <em>CopyFiles=</em>, but instead of copying in a set of files
this just creates the specified directories with the default mode of
0755 owned by the root user and group, plus all their parent directories
(with the same ownership and access mode). To configure directories with
different ownership or access mode, use <em>CopyFiles=</em> and specify
a source tree to copy containing appropriately owned/configured
directories. This option may be used more than once to create multiple
directories. When <em>CopyFiles=</em> and <em>MakeDirectories=</em> are
used together the former is applied first. If a directory listed already
exists no operation is executed (in particular, the ownership/access
mode of the directories is left as is).</p>
<p>The primary usecase for this option is to create a minimal set of
directories that may be mounted over by other partitions contained in
the same disk image. For example, a disk image where the root file
system is formatted at first boot might want to automatically pre-create
/usr/ in it this way, so that the "usr" partition may over-mount it.</p>
<p>Consider using <strong>systemd-tmpfiles</strong>(8) with its
<strong>--image=</strong> option to pre-create other, more complex
directory hierarchies (as well as other inodes) with fine-grained
control of ownership, access modes and other file attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Encrypt=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes one of "off", "key-file", "tpm2" and "key-file+tpm2"
(alternatively, also accepts a boolean value, which is mapped to "off"
when false, and "key-file" when true). Defaults to "off". If not "off"
the partition will be formatted with a LUKS2 superblock, before the
blocks configured with <em>CopyBlocks=</em> are copied in or the file
system configured with <em>Format=</em> is created.</p>
<p>The LUKS2 UUID is automatically derived from the partition UUID in a
stable fashion. If "key-file" or "key-file+tpm2" is used, a key is added
to the LUKS2 superblock, configurable with the
<strong>--key-file=</strong> option to <strong>systemd-repart</strong>.
If "tpm2" or "key-file+tpm2" is used, a key is added to the LUKS2
superblock that is enrolled to the local TPM2 chip, as configured with
the <strong>--tpm2-device=</strong> and <strong>--tpm2-pcrs=</strong>
options to <strong>systemd-repart</strong>.</p>
<p>When used this slightly alters the size allocation logic as the
implicit, minimal size limits of <em>Format=</em> and
<em>CopyBlocks=</em> are increased by the space necessary for the LUKS2
superblock (see above).</p>
<p>This option has no effect if the partition already exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Verity=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes one of "off", "data", "hash" or "signature". Defaults to "off".
If set to "off" or "data", the partition is populated with content as
specified by <em>CopyBlocks=</em> or <em>CopyFiles=</em>. If set to
"hash", the partition will be populated with verity hashes from the
matching verity data partition. If set to "signature", The partition
will be populated with a JSON object containing a signature of the
verity root hash of the matching verity hash partition.</p>
<p>A matching verity partition is a partition with the same verity match
key (as configured with <em>VerityMatchKey=</em>).</p>
<p>If not explicitly configured, the data partitions UUID will be set to
the first 128 bits of the verity root hash. Similarly, if not
configured, the hash partitions UUID will be set to the final 128 bits
of the verity root hash. The verity root hash itself will be included in
the output of <strong>systemd-repart</strong>.</p>
<p>This option has no effect if the partition already exists.</p>
<p>Usage of this option in combination with <em>Encrypt=</em> is not
supported.</p>
<p>For each unique <em>VerityMatchKey=</em> value, a single verity data
partition ("Verity=data") and a single verity hash partition
("Verity=hash") must be defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>VerityMatchKey=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a short, user-chosen identifier string. This setting is used to
find sibling verity partitions for the current verity partition. See the
description for <em>Verity=</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>FactoryReset=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. If specified the partition is marked for
removal during a factory reset operation. This functionality is useful
to implement schemes where images can be reset into their original state
by removing partitions and creating them anew. Defaults to off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Flags=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the 64bit GPT partition flags field to set for the
partition when creating it. This option has no effect if the partition
already exists. If not specified the flags values is set to all zeroes,
except for the three bits that can also be configured via
<em>NoAuto=</em>, <em>ReadOnly=</em> and <em>GrowFileSystem=</em>; see
below for details on the defaults for these three flags. Specify the
flags value in hexadecimal (by prefixing it with "0x"), binary (prefix
"0b") or decimal (no prefix).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NoAuto=</em>, <em>ReadOnly=</em>, <em>GrowFileSystem=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the No-Auto, Read-Only and Grow-File-System partition
flags (bit 63, 60 and 59) of the partition table entry, as defined by
the <strong>Discoverable Partitions Specification</strong>[1]. Only
available for partition types supported by the specification. This
option is a friendly way to set bits 63, 60 and 59 of the partition
flags value without setting any of the other bits, and may be set via
<em>Flags=</em> too, see above.</p>
<p>If <em>Flags=</em> is used in conjunction with one or more of
<em>NoAuto=</em>/<em>ReadOnly=</em>/<em>GrowFileSystem=</em> the latter
control the value of the relevant flags, i.e. the high-level settings
<em>NoAuto=</em>/<em>ReadOnly=</em>/<em>GrowFileSystem=</em> override
the relevant bits of the low-level setting <em>Flags=</em>.</p>
<p>Note that the three flags affect only automatic partition mounting,
as implemented by <strong>systemd-gpt-auto-generator</strong>(8) or the
<strong>--image=</strong> option of various commands (such as
<strong>systemd-nspawn</strong>(1)). It has no effect on explicit
mounts, such as those done via <strong>mount</strong>(8) or
<strong>fstab</strong>(5).</p>
<p>If both bit 50 and 59 are set for a partition (i.e. the partition is
marked both read-only and marked for file system growing) the latter is
typically without effect: the read-only flag takes precedence in most
tools reading these flags, and since growing the file system involves
writing to the partition it is consequently ignored.</p>
<p><em>NoAuto=</em> defaults to off. <em>ReadOnly=</em> defaults to on
for Verity partition types, and off for all others.
<em>GrowFileSystem=</em> defaults to on for all partition types that
support it, except if the partition is marked read-only (and thus
effectively, defaults to off for Verity partitions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SplitName=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the suffix to append to split artifacts when the
<strong>--split</strong> option of <strong>systemd-repart</strong> is
used. Simple specifier expansion is supported, see below. Defaults to
"%t". To disable split artifact generation for a partition, set
<em>SplitName=</em> to "-".</p>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>Example 1. Grow the root partition to the full disk size at
first boot</strong></p>
<p>With the following file the root partition is automatically grown to
the full disk if possible during boot.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># /usr/lib/repart.d/50-root.conf
[Partition]
Type=root</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2. Create a swap and home partition automatically on
boot, if missing</strong></p>
<p>The home partition gets all available disk space while the swap
partition gets 1G at most and 64M at least. We set a priority &gt; 0 on
the swap partition to ensure the swap partition is not used if not
enough space is available. For every three bytes assigned to the home
partition the swap partition gets assigned one.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># /usr/lib/repart.d/60-home.conf
[Partition]
Type=home</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># /usr/lib/repart.d/70-swap.conf
[Partition]
Type=swap
SizeMinBytes=64M
SizeMaxBytes=1G
Priority=1
Weight=333</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 3. Create B partitions in an A/B Verity setup, if
missing</strong></p>
<p>Lets say the vendor intends to update OS images in an A/B setup, i.e.
with two root partitions (and two matching Verity partitions) that shall
be used alternatingly during upgrades. To minimize image sizes the
original image is shipped only with one root and one Verity partition
(the "A" set), and the second root and Verity partitions (the "B" set)
shall be created on first boot on the free space on the medium.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># /usr/lib/repart.d/50-root.conf
[Partition]
Type=root
SizeMinBytes=512M
SizeMaxBytes=512M</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># /usr/lib/repart.d/60-root-verity.conf
[Partition]
Type=root-verity
SizeMinBytes=64M
SizeMaxBytes=64M</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The definitions above cover the "A" set of root partition (of a fixed
512M size) and Verity partition for the root partition (of a fixed 64M
size). Lets use symlinks to create the "B" set of partitions, since
after all they shall have the same properties and sizes as the "A"
set.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># ln -s 50-root.conf /usr/lib/repart.d/70-root-b.conf
# ln -s 60-root-verity.conf /usr/lib/repart.d/80-root-verity-b.conf</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 4. Create a data and verity partition from a OS
tree</strong></p>
<p>Assuming we have an OS tree at /var/tmp/os-tree that we want to
package in a root partition together with a matching verity partition,
we can do so as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># 50-root.conf
[Partition]
Type=root
CopyFiles=/var/tmp/os-tree
Verity=data
VerityMatchKey=root</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># 60-root-verity.conf
[Partition]
Type=root-verity
Verity=hash
VerityMatchKey=root</code></pre>
</blockquote>
