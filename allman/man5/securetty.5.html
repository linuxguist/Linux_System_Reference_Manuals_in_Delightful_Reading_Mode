<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>securetty - list of terminals on which root is allowed to login</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The file <em>/etc/securetty</em> contains the names of terminals (one
per line, without leading <em>/dev/</em>) which are considered secure
for the transmission of certain authentication tokens.</p>
<p>It is used by (some versions of) <strong>login</strong>(1) to
restrict the terminals on which root is allowed to login. See
<strong>login.defs</strong>(5) if you use the shadow suite.</p>
<p>On PAM enabled systems, it is used for the same purpose by
<strong>pam_securetty</strong>(8) to restrict the terminals on which
empty passwords are accepted.</p>
