<p>org.freedesktop.portable1 - The D-Bus interface of
systemd-portabled</p>
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd-portabled.service</strong>(8) is a system service
that may be used to attach, detach and inspect portable services. This
page describes the D-Bus interface.</p>
<h1>THE MANAGER OBJECT</h1>
<p>The service exposes the following interfaces on the Manager object on
the bus:</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><strong>GetImage()</strong> may be used to get the image object path
of the image with the specified name.</p>
<p><strong>ListImages()</strong> returns an array of all currently known
images. The structures in the array consist of the following fields:
image name, type, read-only flag, creation time, modification time,
current disk space, usage and image object path.</p>
<p><strong>GetImageOSRelease()</strong> retrieves the OS release
information of an image. This method returns an array of key value pairs
read from the <strong>os-release</strong>(5) file in the image and is
useful to identify the operating system used in a portable service.</p>
<p><strong>GetImageMetadata()</strong> retrieves metadata associated
with an image. This method returns the image name, the images
<strong>os-release</strong>(5) content in the form of a (streamable)
array of bytes, and a list of portable units contained in the image, in
the form of a string (unit name) and an array of bytes with the
content.</p>
<p><strong>GetImageMetadataWithExtensions()</strong> retrieves metadata
associated with an image. This method is a superset of
<strong>GetImageMetadata()</strong> with the addition of a list of
extensions as input parameter, which were overlaid on top of the main
image via <strong>AttachImageWithExtensions()</strong>. The path of each
extension and an array of bytes with the content of the respective
extension-release file are returned, one such structure for each
extension named in the input arguments.</p>
<p><strong>GetImageState()</strong> retrieves the image state as one of
the following strings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>detached</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>attached</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>attached-runtime</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>enabled</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>enabled-runtime</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>running</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>running-runtime</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GetImageStateWithExtensions()</strong> is a superset of
<strong>GetImageState()</strong>, with additional support for a list of
extensions as input parameters, which is necessary to query the state in
case the image was attached in that particular way. The <em>flag</em>
parameter is currently unused and reserved for future purposes.</p>
<p><strong>AttachImage()</strong> attaches a portable image to the
system. This method takes an image path or name, a list of strings that
will be used to search for unit files inside the image (partial or
complete matches), a string indicating which portable profile to use for
the image (see <em>Profiles</em> property for a list of available
profiles), a boolean indicating whether to attach the image only for the
current boot session, and a string representing the preferred copy mode
(whether to copy the image or to just symlink it) with the following
possible values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>(null)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>copy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>symlink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This method returns the list of changes applied to the system (for
example, which unit was added and is now available as a system service).
Each change is represented as a triplet of strings: the type of change
applied, the path on which it was applied, and the source (if any). The
type of change applied will be one of the following possible values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>copy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>symlink</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>write</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>mkdir</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that an image cannot be attached if a unit that it contains is
already present on the system.</p>
<p><strong>AttachImageWithExtensions()</strong> attaches a portable
image to the system. This method is a superset of
<strong>AttachImage()</strong> with the addition of a list of extensions
as input parameter, which will be overlaid on top of the main image.
When this method is used, detaching must be done by passing the same
arguments via the <strong>DetachImageWithExtensions()</strong> method.
For more details on this functionality, see the <em>MountImages=</em>
entry on <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) and
<strong>systemd-sysext</strong>(8).</p>
<p><strong>DetachImage()</strong> detaches a portable image from the
system. This method takes an image path or name, and a boolean
indicating whether the image to detach was attached only for the current
boot session or persistently. This method returns the list of changes
applied to the system (for example, which unit was removed and is no
longer available as a system service). Each change is represented as a
triplet of strings: the type of change applied, the path on which it was
applied, and the source (if any). The type of change applied will be one
of the following possible values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>unlink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that an image cannot be detached if a unit that it contains is
running.</p>
<p><strong>DetachImageWithExtensions()</strong> detaches a portable
image from the system. This method is a superset of
<strong>DetachImage()</strong> with the addition of a list of extensions
as input parameter, which were overlaid on top of the main image via
<strong>AttachImageWithExtensions()</strong>. The <em>flag</em>
parameter is currently unused and reserved for future purposes.</p>
<p><strong>ReattachImage()</strong> combines the effects of the
<strong>AttachImage()</strong> method and the
<strong>DetachImage()</strong> method. The difference is that it is
allowed to reattach an image while one or more of its units are running.
The reattach operation will fail if no matching image is attached. The
input parameters match the <strong>AttachImage()</strong> method, and
the return parameters are the combination of the return parameters of
the <strong>DetachImage()</strong> method (first array, units that were
removed) and the <strong>AttachImage()</strong> method (second array,
units that were updated or added).</p>
<p><strong>ReattachImageWithExtensions()</strong> reattaches a portable
image to the system. This method is a superset of
<strong>ReattachImage()</strong> with the addition of a list of
extensions as input parameter, which will be overlaid on top of the main
image. For more details on this functionality, see the
<em>MountImages=</em> entry on <strong>systemd.exec</strong>(5) and
<strong>systemd-sysext</strong>(8). The <em>flag</em> parameter is
currently unused and reserved for future purposes</p>
<p><strong>RemoveImage()</strong> removes the image with the specified
name.</p>
<p><strong>MarkImageReadOnly()</strong> toggles the read-only flag of an
image.</p>
<p><strong>SetPoolLimit()</strong> sets an overall quota limit on the
pool of images.</p>
<p><strong>SetImageLimit()</strong> sets a per-image quota limit.</p>
<p>The <strong>AttachImageWithExtensions()</strong>,
<strong>DetachImageWithExtensions()</strong> and
<strong>ReattachImageWithExtensions()</strong> methods take in options
as flags instead of booleans to allow for extendability.
<em>SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_ATTACH</em> will cause safety checks that
ensure the units are not running while the new image is attached or
detached to be skipped. <em>SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_SYSEXT</em> will
cause the check that the extension-release.<em>NAME</em> file in the
extension image matches the image name to be skipped. They are defined
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>#define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_RUNTIME         (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 0)
#define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_ATTACH    (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 1)
#define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_SYSEXT    (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 2)
      </code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p><em>PoolPath</em> specifies the file system path where images are
written to.</p>
<p><em>PoolUsage</em> specifies the current usage size of the image pool
in bytes.</p>
<p><em>PoolLimit</em> specifies the size limit of the image pool in
bytes.</p>
<p><em>Profiles</em> specifies the available runtime profiles for
portable services.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The following methods implement the same operation as the respective
methods on the Manager object (see above). However, these methods
operate on the image object and hence does not take an image name
parameter. Invoking the methods directly on the Manager object has the
advantage of not requiring a <strong>GetImage()</strong> call to get the
image object for a specific image name. Calling the methods on the
Manager object is hence a round trip optimization. List of methods:</p>
