<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pci.ids - list of known identifiers related to PCI devices</p>
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Devices on the PCI bus are identified by a combination of a vendor ID
(assigned by the PCI SIG) and device ID (assigned by the vendor). Both
IDs are 16-bit integers and the device itself provides no translation to
a human-readable string.</p>
<p>In addition to the vendor and device, devices also report several
other identifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Device class and subclass (two 8-bit numbers)</p></li>
<li><p>Programming interface (8-bit number, meaning specific for the
subclass)</p></li>
<li><p>Subsystem, which identifies the assembly in which the device is
contained. A typical example is an Ethernet add-in card: the device is
the Ethernet controller chip, while the card plays the role of the
subsystem. Subsystems have their vendor ID (from the same namespace as
device vendors) and subsystem ID. Generally, the meaning of the
subsystem ID depends on the device, but there are cases in which a
single subsystem ID is used for many devices - e.g., laptop
motherboards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The PCI utilities use the <strong>pci.ids</strong> file to translate
all these numeric IDs to strings.</p>
<h1>KEEPING THE LIST UP-TO-DATE</h1>
<p>The <strong>pci.ids</strong> file is generated from the PCI ID
database, which is maintained at <a href="https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/"></a>.
If you find any IDs missing from the list, please contribute them to the
database.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>update-pciids</strong> command to download
the current version of the list.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use <strong>lspci -q</strong> to query the
database online.</p>
<h1>FILE FORMAT</h1>
<p>The pci.ids file is a text file in plain ASCII, interpreted line by
line. Lines starting with the hash sign are treated as comments are
ignored. Comments regarding a specific entry are written immediately
before the entry.</p>
<p>Vendor entries start with a 4-digit hexadecimal vendor ID, followed
by one or more spaces, and the name of the vendor extending to the end
of the line.</p>
<p>Device entries are placed below the vendor entry. Each device entry
consists of a single TAB character, a 4-digit hexadecimal device ID,
followed by one or more spaces, and the name of the device extending to
the end of the line.</p>
<p>Subsystem entries are placed below the device entry. They start with
two TAB characters, a 4-digit hexadecimal vendor ID (which must be
defined elsewhere in the list), a single space, a 4-digit hexadecimal
subsystem ID, one or more spaces, and the name of the subsystem
extending to the end of the line.</p>
<p>Class entries consist of "C", one space, 2-digit hexadecimal class
ID, one or more spaces, and the name of the class. Subclasses are placed
below the corresponding class, indented by a single TAB, followed by a
2-digit hexadecimal subclass ID, one or more spaces, and the name of the
subclass. Programming interfaces are below the subclass, indented by two
TABs, followed by a 2-digit hexadecimal prog-if ID, one or more spaces,
and the name.</p>
<p>There can be device-independent subsystem IDs, although the web
interface of the database does not support them yet. They start with a
subsystem vendor line consisting of "S", one space, and a 4-digit
hexadecimal vendor ID (which must correspond to an already listed
vendor). Subsystems follow on subsequent lines, each indented by one
TAB, followed by a 4-digit hexadecimal subsystem ID, one or more spaces,
and the name of the subsystem.</p>
<p>To ensure extensibility of the format, lines starting with an
unrecognized letter followed by a single space are ignored and so are
all following TAB-indented lines.</p>
