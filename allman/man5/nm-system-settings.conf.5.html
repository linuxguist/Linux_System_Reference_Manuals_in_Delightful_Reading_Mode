<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>NetworkManager.conf - NetworkManager configuration file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf,
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/<em>name</em>.conf,
/run/NetworkManager/conf.d/<em>name</em>.conf,
/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<em>name</em>.conf,
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>NetworkManager.conf is the configuration file for NetworkManager. It
is used to set up various aspects of NetworkManagers behavior. The
location of the main file and configuration directories may be changed
through use of the <strong>--config</strong>,
<strong>--config-dir</strong>, <strong>--system-config-dir</strong>, and
<strong>--intern-config</strong> argument for NetworkManager,
respectively.</p>
<p>If a default NetworkManager.conf is provided by your distributions
packages, you should not modify it, since your changes may get
overwritten by package updates. Instead, you can add additional .conf
files to the /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d directory. These will be read in
order, with later files overriding earlier ones. Packages might install
further configuration snippets to /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d. This
directory is parsed first, even before NetworkManager.conf. Scripts can
also put per-boot configuration into /run/NetworkManager/conf.d. This
directory is parsed second, also before NetworkManager.conf. The loading
of a file /run/NetworkManager/conf.d/<em>name</em>.conf can be prevented
by adding a file /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/<em>name</em>.conf.
Likewise, a file /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<em>name</em>.conf can
be shadowed by putting a file of the same name to either
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d or /run/NetworkManager/conf.d.</p>
<p>NetworkManager can overwrite certain user configuration options via
D-Bus or other internal operations. In this case it writes those changes
to /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf. This file is not
intended to be modified by the user, but it is read last and can shadow
user configuration from NetworkManager.conf.</p>
<p>Certain settings from the configuration can be reloaded at runtime
either by sending SIGHUP signal or via D-Bus Reload call.</p>
<p>NetworkManager does not require any configuration in
NetworkManager.conf. Depending on your use case, you may remove all
files to restore the default configuration (factory reset). But note
that your distribution or other packages may drop configuration snippets
for NetworkManager, such that they are part of the factory default.</p>
<h1>FILE FORMAT</h1>
<p>The configuration file format is so-called key file (sort of
ini-style format). It consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs.
Lines beginning with a # and blank lines are considered comments.
Sections are started by a header line containing the section enclosed in
[ and ], and ended implicitly by the start of the next section or the
end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.</p>
<p>For keys that take a list of devices as their value, you can specify
devices by their MAC addresses or interface names, or "*" to specify all
devices. See the section called “Device List Format” below.</p>
<p>A simple configuration file looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[main]
plugins=keyfile</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As an extension to the normal keyfile format, you can also append a
value to a previously-set list-valued key by doing:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>plugins+=another-plugin
plugins-=remove-me</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>MAIN SECTION</h1>
<p><em>plugins</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lists system settings plugin names separated by ,. These plugins are
used to read and write system-wide connection profiles. When multiple
plugins are specified, the connections are read from all listed plugins.
When writing connections, the plugins will be asked to save the
connection in the order listed here; if the first plugin cannot write
out that connection type (or cant write out any connections) the next
plugin is tried, etc. If none of the plugins can save the connection, an
error is returned to the user.</p>
<p>The default value and the number of available plugins is
distro-specific. See the section called “PLUGINS” below for the
available plugins. Note that NetworkManagers native keyfile plugin is
always appended to the end of this list (if it doesnt already appear
earlier in the list).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>monitor-connection-files</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This setting is deprecated and has no effect. Profiles from disk are
never automatically reloaded. Use for example nmcli connection (re)load
for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>auth-polkit</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the system uses PolicyKit for authorization. If true,
non-root requests are authorized using PolicyKit. Requests from root
(user ID zero) are always granted without asking PolicyKit. If false,
all requests will be allowed and PolicyKit is not used. If set to
root-only PolicyKit is not used and all requests except root are denied.
The default value is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>dhcp</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This key sets up what DHCP client NetworkManager will use. Allowed
values are dhclient, dhcpcd, and internal. The dhclient and dhcpcd
options require the indicated clients to be installed. The internal
option uses a built-in DHCP client which is not currently as featureful
as the external clients.</p>
<p>If this key is missing, it defaults to internal. If the chosen plugin
is not available, clients are looked for in this order: dhclient,
dhcpcd, internal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>no-auto-default</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify devices for which NetworkManager shouldnt create default
wired connection (Auto eth0). By default, NetworkManager creates a
temporary wired connection for any Ethernet device that is managed and
doesnt have a connection configured. List a device in this option to
inhibit creating the default connection for the device. May have the
special value * to apply to all devices.</p>
<p>When the default wired connection is deleted or saved to a new
persistent connection by a plugin, the device is added to a list in the
file /var/lib/NetworkManager/no-auto-default.state to prevent creating
the default connection for that device again.</p>
<p>See the section called “Device List Format” for the syntax how to
specify a device.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>no-auto-default=00:22:68:5c:5d:c4,00:1e:65:ff:aa:ee
no-auto-default=eth0,eth1
no-auto-default=*</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ignore-carrier</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This setting is deprecated for the per-device setting ignore-carrier
which overwrites this setting if specified (See
<em>ignore-carrier</em>). Otherwise, it is a list of matches to specify
for which device carrier should be ignored. See the section called
“Device List Format” for the syntax how to specify a device. Note that
master types like bond, bridge, and team ignore carrier by default. You
can however revert that default using the "except:" specifier (or
better, use the per-device setting instead of the deprecated
setting).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>assume-ipv6ll-only</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify devices for which NetworkManager will try to generate a
connection based on initial configuration when the device only has an
IPv6 link-local address.</p>
<p>See the section called “Device List Format” for the syntax how to
specify a device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>configure-and-quit</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is no longer useful to configure in NetworkManager.conf
file. It can however also be configured on the command line with the
same values, where it has some use.</p>
<p>When set to initrd, NetworkManager does not connect to D-Bus and
quits after configuring the network. This is an implementation detail
how the NetworkManager module of dracut can run NetworkManager. An
alternative to this is having NetworkManager as a systemd service with
D-Bus in initrd.</p>
<p>The value true is unsupported since version 1.36. Previously this was
a mode where NetworkManager would quit after configuring the network and
run helper processes for DHCP and SLAAC.</p>
<p>Otherwise, NetworkManager runs a system service with D-Bus and does
not quit during normal operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>hostname-mode</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the management mode of the hostname. This parameter will affect
only the transient hostname. If a valid static hostname is set,
NetworkManager will skip the update of the hostname despite the value of
this option. An hostname empty or equal to localhost, localhost6,
localhost.localdomain or localhost6.localdomain is considered
invalid.</p>
<p>default: NetworkManager will update the hostname with the one
provided via DHCP or reverse DNS lookup of the IP address on the
connection with the default route or on any connection with the property
hostname.only-from-default set to false. Connections are considered in
order of increasing value of the hostname.priority property. In case
multiple connections have the same priority, connections activated
earlier are considered first. If no hostname can be determined in such
way, the hostname will be updated to the last one set outside
NetworkManager or to localhost.localdomain.</p>
<p>dhcp: this is similar to default, with the difference that after
trying to get the DHCP hostname, reverse DNS lookup is not done. Note
that selecting this option is equivalent to setting the property
hostname.from-dns-lookup to false globally for all connections in
NetworkManager.conf.</p>
<p>none: NetworkManager will not manage the transient hostname and will
never set it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>dns</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the DNS processing mode.</p>
<p>If the key is unspecified, default is used, unless /etc/resolv.conf
is a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf,
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, /lib/systemd/resolv.conf or
/usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf. In that case, systemd-resolved is chosen
automatically.</p>
<p>default: NetworkManager will update /etc/resolv.conf to reflect the
nameservers provided by currently active connections. The rc-manager
setting (below) controls how this is done.</p>
<p>dnsmasq: NetworkManager will run dnsmasq as a local caching
nameserver, using "Conditional Forwarding" if you are connected to a
VPN, and then update resolv.conf to point to the local nameserver. It is
possible to pass custom options to the dnsmasq instance by adding them
to files in the "/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/" directory. Note that
when multiple upstream servers are available, dnsmasq will initially
contact them in parallel and then use the fastest to respond, probing
again other servers after some time. This behavior can be modified
passing the all-servers or strict-order options to dnsmasq (see the
manual page for more details).</p>
<p>systemd-resolved: NetworkManager will push the DNS configuration to
systemd-resolved</p>
<p>none: NetworkManager will not modify resolv.conf. This implies
rc-manager unmanaged</p>
<p>Note that the plugins dnsmasq and systemd-resolved are caching local
nameservers. Hence, when NetworkManager writes
/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf and /etc/resolv.conf (according to
rc-manager setting below), the name server there will be localhost only.
NetworkManager also writes a file
/run/NetworkManager/no-stub-resolv.conf that contains the original name
servers pushed to the DNS plugin.</p>
<p>When using dnsmasq and systemd-resolved per-connection added dns
servers will always be queried using the device the connection has been
activated on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>rc-manager</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the resolv.conf management mode. This option is about how
NetworkManager writes to /etc/resolv.conf, if at all. The default value
depends on NetworkManager build options, and this version of
NetworkManager was build with a default of "". Regardless of this
setting, NetworkManager will always write its version of resolv.conf to
its runtime state directory as /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf.</p>
<p>If you configure dns=none or make /etc/resolv.conf immutable with
chattr +i, NetworkManager will ignore this setting and always choose
unmanaged (below).</p>
<p>auto: if systemd-resolved plugin is configured via the dns setting or
if it gets detected as main DNS plugin, NetworkManager will update
systemd-resolved without touching /etc/resolv.conf. Alternatively, if
resolvconf or netconfig are enabled at compile time and the respective
binary is found, NetworkManager will automatically use it. Note that if
you install or uninstall these binaries, you need to reload the
rc-manager setting with SIGHUP or systemctl reload NetworkManager. As
last fallback it uses the symlink option (see next).</p>
<p>symlink: If /etc/resolv.conf is a regular file or does not exist,
NetworkManager will write the file directly. If /etc/resolv.conf is
instead a symlink, NetworkManager will leave it alone. Unless the
symlink points to the internal file /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf, in
which case the symlink will be updated to emit an inotify notification.
This allows the user to conveniently instruct NetworkManager not to
manage /etc/resolv.conf by replacing it with a symlink.</p>
<p>file: NetworkManager will write /etc/resolv.conf as regular file. If
it finds a symlink to an existing target, it will follow the symlink and
update the target instead. In no case will an existing symlink be
replaced by a file. Note that older versions of NetworkManager behaved
differently and would replace dangling symlinks with a plain file.</p>
<p>resolvconf: NetworkManager will run resolvconf to update the DNS
configuration.</p>
<p>netconfig: NetworkManager will run netconfig to update the DNS
configuration.</p>
<p>unmanaged: dont touch /etc/resolv.conf.</p>
<p>none: deprecated alias for symlink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>systemd-resolved</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send the connection DNS configuration to systemd-resolved. Defaults
to "true".</p>
<p>Note that this setting is complementary to the <em>dns</em> setting.
You can keep this enabled while using <em>dns</em> set to another DNS
plugin alongside systemd-resolved, or <em>dns</em> set to
systemd-resolved to configure the system resolver to use
systemd-resolved.</p>
<p>If systemd-resolved is enabled, the connectivity check resolves the
hostname per-device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>debug</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comma separated list of options to aid debugging. This value will be
combined with the environment variable NM_DEBUG. Currently, the
following values are supported:</p>
<p>RLIMIT_CORE: set ulimit -c unlimited to write out core dumps. Beware,
that a core dump can contain sensitive information such as passwords or
configuration settings.</p>
<p>fatal-warnings: set g_log_set_always_fatal() to core dump on warning
messages from glib. This is equivalent to the --g-fatal-warnings command
line option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>autoconnect-retries-default</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of times a connection activation should be automatically
tried before switching to another one. This value applies only to
connections that can auto-connect and have a
connection.autoconnect-retries property set to -1. If not specified,
connections will be tried 4 times. Setting this value to 1 means to try
activation once, without retry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>slaves-order</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This key specifies in which order slave connections are
auto-activated on boot or when the master activates them. Allowed values
are name (order connection by interface name, the default), or index
(order slaves by their kernel index).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>firewall-backend</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The firewall backend for configuring masquerading with shared mode.
Set to either iptables, nftables or none. iptables and nftables require
iptables and nft application, respectively. none means to skip firewall
configuration if the users wish to manage firewall themselves. If
unspecified, it will be auto detected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>iwd-config-path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the value is "auto" (the default), IWD is queried for its current
state directory when it appears on D-Bus -- the directory where IWD
keeps its network configuration files -- usually /var/lib/iwd.
NetworkManager will then attempt to write copies of new or modified
Wi-Fi connection profiles, converted into the IWD format, into this
directory thus making IWD connection properties editable. NM will
overwrite existing files without preserving their contents.</p>
<p>The path can also be overriden by pointing to a specific existing and
writable directory. On the other hand setting this to an empty string or
any other value disables the profile conversion mechanism.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows editing connection profile settings such as the
802.1x configuration using NetworkManager clients. Without it such
changes have no effect in IWD.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>KEYFILE SECTION</h1>
<p>This section contains keyfile-plugin-specific options, and is
normally only used when you are not using any other distro-specific
plugin.</p>
<p><em>hostname</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This key is deprecated and has no effect since the hostname is now
stored in /etc/hostname or other system configuration files according to
build options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>path</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The location where keyfiles are read and stored. This defaults to
"/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>unmanaged-devices</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set devices that should be ignored by NetworkManager.</p>
<p>A device unmanaged due to this option is strictly unmanaged and
cannot be overruled by using the API like <strong>nmcli device set
$IFNAME managed yes</strong>. Also, a device that is unmanaged for other
reasons, like an udev rule, cannot be made managed with this option
(e.g. by using an except: specifier). These two points make it different
from the device*.managed option which for that reason may be a better
choice.</p>
<p>See the section called “Device List Format” for the syntax on how to
specify a device.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>unmanaged-devices=interface-name:em4
unmanaged-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface-name:eth2</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h1>IFUPDOWN SECTION</h1>
<p>This section contains ifupdown-specific options and thus only has
effect when using the ifupdown plugin.</p>
<p><em>managed</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, then interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces are
managed by NetworkManager. If set to false, then any interface listed in
/etc/network/interfaces will be ignored by NetworkManager. Remember that
NetworkManager controls the default route, so because the interface is
ignored, NetworkManager may assign the default route to some other
interface.</p>
<p>The default value is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>LOGGING SECTION</h1>
<p>This section controls NetworkManagers logging. Logging is very
important to understand what NetworkManager is doing. When you report a
bug, do not unnecessarily filter or limit the log file. Just enable
level=TRACE and domains=ALL to collect everything.</p>
<p>The recommended way for enabling logging is with a file
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/95-logging.conf that contains</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[logging]
level=TRACE
domains=ALL</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>and restart the daemon with <strong>systemctl restart
NetworkManager</strong>. Then reproduce the problem. You can find the
logs in syslog (for example <strong>journalctl</strong>).</p>
<p>Any settings here are overridden by the <strong>--log-level</strong>
and <strong>--log-domains</strong> command-line options. Logging can
also be reconfigured at runtime with <strong>nmcli general logging level
"$LEVEL" domains "$DOMAINS"</strong>. However, often it is interesting
to get a complete log from the start. Especially, when debugging an
issue, enable debug logging in NetworkManager.conf and restart the
service to enable verbose logging early on.</p>
<p>By setting <strong>nm.debug</strong> on the kernel command line
(either from /run/NetworkManager/proc-cmdline or /proc/cmdline), debug
logging is enabled. This overrides both the command-line options and the
settings from NetworkManager.conf.</p>
<p>NetworkManagers logging aims not to contain private sensitive data
and you should be fine sharing the debug logs. Still, there will be IP
addresses and your network setup, if you consider that private then
review the log before sharing. However, try not to mangle the logfile in
a way that distorts the meaning too much.</p>
<p>NetworkManager uses syslog or systemd-journald, depending on
configuration. In any case, debug logs are verbose and might be rate
limited or filtered by the logging daemon. For systemd-journald, see
RateLimitIntervalSec and RateLimitBurst in journald.conf manual for how
to disable that.</p>
<p><em>level</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default logging verbosity level. One of OFF, ERR, WARN, INFO,
DEBUG, TRACE, in order of verbosity.</p>
<p>OFF disables all logging. INFO is the default verbosity for regular
operation. TRACE is for debugging.</p>
<p>The other levels are in most cases not useful. For example, DEBUG is
between TRACE and INFO, but its too verbose for regular operation and
lacks possibly interesting messages for debugging. Almost always, when
debugging an issue or reporting a bug, collect full level TRACE logs to
get the full picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>domains</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter the messages by their topic. When debugging an issue, its
better to collect all logs (ALL domain) upfront. The unnecessary parts
can always be ignored later.</p>
<p>In the uncommon case to tune out certain topics, the following log
domains are available: PLATFORM, RFKILL, ETHER, WIFI, BT, MB, DHCP4,
DHCP6, PPP, WIFI_SCAN, IP4, IP6, AUTOIP4, DNS, VPN, SHARING, SUPPLICANT,
AGENTS, SETTINGS, SUSPEND, CORE, DEVICE, OLPC, WIMAX, INFINIBAND,
FIREWALL, ADSL, BOND, VLAN, BRIDGE, DBUS_PROPS, TEAM, CONCHECK, DCB,
DISPATCH, AUDIT, SYSTEMD, VPN_PLUGIN, PROXY.</p>
<p>In addition, these special domains can be used: NONE, ALL, DEFAULT,
DHCP, IP.</p>
<p>You can specify per-domain log level overrides by adding a colon and
a log level to any domain. E.g., "WIFI:DEBUG,WIFI_SCAN:OFF". Another
example is ALL,VPN_PLUGIN:TRACE to enable all the logging there is (see
about VPN_PLUGIN below).</p>

value is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>CONNECTION SECTION</h1>
<p>Specify default values for connections.</p>
<p>Such default values are only consulted if the corresponding
per-connection property explicitly allows for that. That means, all
these properties correspond to a property of the connection profile (for
example connection.mud-url). Only if the per-profile property is set to
a special value that indicates to use the default, the default value
from NetworkManager.conf is consulted. It depends on the property, which
is the special value that indicates fallback to the default, but it
usually is something like empty, unset values or special numeric values
like 0 or -1. That means the effectively used value can first always be
configured for each profile, and these default values only matter if the
per-profile values explicitly indicates to use the default from
NetworkManager.conf.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[connection]
ipv6.ip6-privacy=0</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Supported Properties</h2>
<p>Not all properties can be overwritten, only the following properties
are supported to have their default values configured (see
<strong>nm-settings</strong>(5) for details).</p>
<p><em>802-1x.auth-timeout</em></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>cdma.mtu</em></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.auth-retries</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If left unspecified, the default value is 3 tries before failing the
connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.autoconnect-slaves</em></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.mud-url</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If unspecified, MUD URL defaults to "none".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.lldp</em></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.llmnr</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If unspecified, the ultimate default values depends on the DNS
plugin. With systemd-resolved the default currently is "yes" (2) and for
all other plugins "no" (0).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.mdns</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If unspecified, the ultimate default values depends on the DNS
plugin. With systemd-resolved the default currently is "no" (0) and for
all other plugins also "no" (0).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.mptcp-flags</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If unspecified, the fallback is 0x22 ("enabled,subflow"). Note that
if sysctl /proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled is disabled, NetworkManager will
still not configure endpoints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.dns-over-tls</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If unspecified, the ultimate default values depends on the DNS
plugin. With systemd-resolved the default currently is global setting
and for all other plugins "no" (0).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>connection.stable-id</em></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>ethernet.cloned-mac-address</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If left unspecified, it defaults to "preserve".</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>You can configure multiple connection sections, by having different
sections with a name that all start with "connection". Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[connection]
ipv6.ip6-privacy=0
connection.autoconnect-slaves=1
vpn.timeout=120

[connection-wifi-wlan0]
match-device=interface-name:wlan0
ipv4.route-metric=50

[connection-wifi-other]
match-device=type:wifi
ipv4.route-metric=55
ipv6.ip6-privacy=1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The sections within one file are considered in order of appearance,
with the exception that the [connection] section is always considered
last. In the example above, this order is [connection-wifi-wlan0],
[connection-wlan-other], and [connection]. When checking for a default
configuration value, the sections are searched until the requested value
is found. In the example above, "ipv4.route-metric" for wlan0 interface
is set to 50, and for all other Wi-Fi typed interfaces to 55. Also,
Wi-Fi devices would have IPv6 private addresses enabled by default, but
other devices would have it disabled. Note that also "wlan0" gets
"ipv6.ip6-privacy=1", because although the section
"[connection-wifi-wlan0]" matches the device, it does not contain that
property and the search continues.</p>
<p>When having different sections in multiple files, sections from files
that are read later have higher priority. So within one file the
priority of the sections is top-to-bottom. Across multiple files later
definitions take precedence.</p>
<p>The following properties further control how a connection section
applies.</p>
<p><em>match-device</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An optional device spec that restricts when the section applies. See
the section called “Device List Format” for the possible values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>stop-match</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An optional boolean value which defaults to no. If the section
matches (based on match-device), further sections will not be considered
even if the property in question is not present. In the example above,
if [connection-wifi-wlan0] would have stop-match set to yes, the device
wlan0 would have ipv6.ip6-privacy property unspecified. That is, the
search for the property would not continue in the connection sections
[connection-wifi-other] or [connection].</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>DEVICE SECTION</h1>
<p>Contains per-device persistent configuration.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[device]
match-device=interface-name:eth3
managed=1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Supported Properties</h2>
<p>The following properties can be configured per-device.</p>
<p><em>managed</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the device is managed or not. A device can be marked as
managed via udev rules (ENV{NM_UNMANAGED}), or via setting plugins
(keyfile.unmanaged-devices). This is yet another way. Note that this
configuration can be overruled at runtime via D-Bus. Also, it has higher
priority then udev rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>carrier-wait-timeout</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the timeout for waiting for carrier in milliseconds. The
default is 5000 milliseconds. This setting exists because certain
drivers/hardware can take a long time to detect whether the cable is
plugged in.</p>
<p>When the device loses carrier, NetworkManager does not react
immediately. Instead, it waits for this timeout before considering the
link lost.</p>
<p>Also, on startup, NetworkManager considers the device as busy for
this time, as long as the device has no carrier. This delays
startup-complete signal and NetworkManager-wait-online. Configuring this
too high means to block NetworkManager-wait-online longer than necessary
when booting with cable unplugged. Configuring it too low, means that
NetworkManager will declare startup-complete too soon, although carrier
is about to come and auto-activation to kick in. Note that if a profile
only has static IP configuration or Layer 3 configuration disabled, then
it can already autoconnect without carrier on the device. Once such a
profile reaches full activated state, startup-complete is considered as
reached even if the device has no carrier yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ignore-carrier</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify devices for which NetworkManager will (partially) ignore the
carrier state. Normally, for device types that support carrier-detect,
such as Ethernet and InfiniBand, NetworkManager will only allow a
connection to be activated on the device if carrier is present (ie, a
cable is plugged in), and it will deactivate the device if carrier drops
for more than a few seconds.</p>
<p>A device with carrier ignored will allow activating connections on
that device even when it does not have carrier, provided that the
connection uses only statically-configured IP addresses. Additionally,
it will allow any active connection (whether static or dynamic) to
remain active on the device when carrier is lost.</p>
<p>Note that the "carrier" property of NMDevices and device D-Bus
interfaces will still reflect the actual device state; its just that
NetworkManager will not make use of that information.</p>
<p>Master types like bond, bridge and team ignore carrier by default,
while other device types react on carrier changes by default.</p>
<p>This setting overwrites the deprecated main.ignore-carrier setting
above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>keep-configuration</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On startup, NetworkManager tries to not interfere with interfaces
that are already configured. It does so by generating a in-memory
connection based on the interface current configuration.</p>
<p>If this generated connection matches one of the existing persistent
connections, the persistent connection gets activated. If there is no
match, the generated connection gets activated as "external", which
means that the connection is considered as active, but NetworkManager
doesnt actually touch the interface.</p>
<p>It is possible to disable this behavior by setting keep-configuration
to no. In this way, on startup NetworkManager always tries to activate
the most suitable persistent connection (the one with highest
autoconnect-priority or, in case of a tie, the one activated most
recently).</p>
<p>Note that when NetworkManager gets restarted, it stores the previous
state in /run/NetworkManager; in particular it saves the UUID of the
connection that was previously active so that it can be activated again
after the restart. Therefore, keep-configuration does not have any
effect on service restart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>allowed-connections</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of connections that can be activated on the device. See the
section called “Connection List Format” for the syntax to specify a
connection. If this option is not specified, all connections can be
potentially activated on the device, provided that the connection type
and other settings match.</p>
<p>A notable use case for this is to filter which connections can be
activated based on how they were created; see the origin keyword in the
section called “Connection List Format”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>wifi.scan-rand-mac-address</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures MAC address randomization of a Wi-Fi device during
scanning. This defaults to yes in which case a random,
locally-administered MAC address will be used. The setting
wifi.scan-generate-mac-address-mask allows to influence the generated
MAC address to use certain vendor OUIs. If disabled, the MAC address
during scanning is left unchanged to whatever is configured. For the
configured MAC address while the device is associated, see instead the
per-connection setting wifi.cloned-mac-address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>wifi.backend</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the Wi-Fi backend used for the device. Currently, supported
are wpa_supplicant and iwd (experimental). If unspecified, the default
is "wpa_supplicant".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>wifi.scan-generate-mac-address-mask</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like the per-connection settings ethernet.generate-mac-address-mask
and wifi.generate-mac-address-mask, this allows to configure the
generated MAC addresses during scanning. See
<strong>nm-settings</strong>(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>wifi.iwd.autoconnect</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If wifi.backend is iwd, setting this to false forces IWDs autoconnect
mechanism to be disabled for this device and connections will only be
initiated by NetworkManager whether commanded by a client or
automatically. Leaving it true (default) stops NetworkManager from
automatically initiating connections and allows IWD to use its network
ranking and scanning logic to decide the best networks to autoconnect to
next. Connections autoconnect-priority, autoconnect-retries settings
will be ignored. Other settings like permissions or multi-connect may
interfere with IWD connection attempts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>sriov-num-vfs</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the number of virtual functions (VF) to enable for a PCI
physical device that supports single-root I/O virtualization
(SR-IOV).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>The [device] section works the same as the [connection] section. That
is, multiple sections that all start with the prefix "device" can be
specified. The settings "match-device" and "stop-match" are available to
match a device section on a device. The order of multiple sections is
also top-down within the file and later files overwrite previous
settings. See “Sections” under the section called “CONNECTION SECTION”
for details.</p>
<h1>CONNECTIVITY SECTION</h1>
<p>This section controls NetworkManagers optional connectivity checking
functionality. This allows NetworkManager to detect whether or not the
system can actually access the internet or whether it is behind a
captive portal.</p>
<p>Connectivity checking serves two purposes. For one, it exposes a
connectivity state on D-Bus, which other applications may use. For
example, Gnomes portal helper uses this as signal to show a captive
portal login page. The other use is that default-route of devices
without global connectivity get a penalty of +20000 to the route-metric.
This has the purpose to give a better default-route to devices that have
global connectivity. For example, when being connected to WWAN and to a
Wi-Fi network which is behind a captive portal, WWAN still gets
preferred until login.</p>
<p>Note that your distribution might set
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter to strict filtering. That works
badly with per-device connectivity checking, which uses SO_BINDDEVICE to
send requests on all devices. A strict rp_filter setting will reject any
response and the connectivity check on all but the best route will
fail.</p>
<p><em>enabled</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether connectivity check is enabled. Note that to enable
connectivity check, a valid uri must also be configured. The value
defaults to true, but since the uri is unset by default, connectivity
check may be disabled. The main purpose of this option is to have a
single flag to disable connectivity check. Note that this setting can
also be set via D-Bus API at runtime. In that case, the value gets
stored in /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>uri</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The URI of a web page to periodically request when connectivity is
being checked. This page should return the header
"X-NetworkManager-Status" with a value of "online". Alternatively, its
body content should be set to "NetworkManager is online". The body
content check can be controlled by the response option. If this option
is blank or missing, connectivity checking is disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>interval</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specified in seconds; controls how often connectivity is checked when
a network connection exists. If set to 0 connectivity checking is
disabled. If missing, the default is 300 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>response</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, controls what body content NetworkManager checks for when
requesting the URI for connectivity checking. Note that this only
compares that the HTTP response starts with the specifid text, it does
not compare the exact string. This behavior might change in the future,
so avoid relying on it. If missing, the response defaults to
"NetworkManager is online". If set to empty, the HTTP server is expected
to answer with status code 204 or send no data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>GLOBAL-DNS SECTION</h1>
<p>This section specifies DNS settings that are applied globally, in
addition to connection-specific ones.</p>
<p><em>searches</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of search domains to be used during hostname lookup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>options</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of options to be passed to the hostname resolver.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>GLOBAL-DNS-DOMAIN SECTIONS</h1>
<p>Sections with a name starting with the "global-dns-domain-" prefix
allow to define global DNS configuration for specific domains. The part
of section name after "global-dns-domain-" specifies the domain name a
section applies to (for example, a section could be named
"global-dns-domain-foobar.com"). More specific domains have the
precedence over less specific ones and the default domain is represented
by the wildcard "*". To be valid, global DNS domains must include a
section for the default domain "*". When the global DNS domains are
valid, the name servers and domains defined globally override the ones
from active connections.</p>
<p><em>servers</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of addresses of DNS servers to be used for the given
domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>options</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of domain-specific DNS options. Not used at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>.CONFIG SECTIONS</h1>
<p>This is a special section that contains options which apply to the
configuration file that contains the option.</p>
<p><em>enable</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defaults to "true". If "false", the configuration file will be
skipped during loading. Note that the main configuration file
NetworkManager.conf cannot be disabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># always skip loading the config file
[.config]
enable=false</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also match against the version of NetworkManager. For example
the following are valid configurations:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># only load on version 1.0.6
[.config]
enable=nm-version:1.0.6

# load on all versions 1.0.x, but not 1.2.x
[.config]
enable=nm-version:1.0

# only load on versions &gt;= 1.1.6. This does not match
# with version 1.2.0 or 1.4.4. Only the last digit is considered.
[.config]
enable=nm-version-min:1.1.6

# only load on versions &gt;= 1.2. Contrary to the previous
# example, this also matches with 1.2.0, 1.2.10, 1.4.4, etc.
[.config]
enable=nm-version-min:1.2

# Match against the maximum allowed version. The example matches
# versions 1.2.0, 1.2.2, 1.2.4. Again, only the last version digit
# is allowed to be smaller. So this would not match on 1.1.10.
[.config]
enable=nm-version-max:1.2.6</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also match against the value of the environment variable
NM_CONFIG_ENABLE_TAG, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># always skip loading the file when running NetworkManager with
# environment variable &quot;NM_CONFIG_ENABLE_TAG=TAG1&quot;
[.config]
enable=env:TAG1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>More then one match can be specified. The configuration will be
enabled if one of the predicates matches ("or"). The special prefix
"except:" can be used to negate the match. Note that if one
except-predicate matches, the entire configuration will be disabled. In
other words, a except predicate always wins over other predicates. If
the setting only consists of "except:" matches and none of the negative
conditions are satisfied, the configuration is still enabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># enable the configuration either when the environment variable
# is present or the version is at least 1.2.0.
[.config]
enable=env:TAG2,nm-version-min:1.2

# enable the configuration for version &gt;= 1.2.0, but disable
# it when the environment variable is set to &quot;TAG3&quot;
[.config]
enable=except:env:TAG3,nm-version-min:1.2

# enable the configuration on &gt;= 1.3, &gt;= 1.2.6, and &gt;= 1.0.16.
# Useful if a certain feature is only present since those releases.
[.config]
enable=nm-version-min:1.3,nm-version-min:1.2.6,nm-version-min:1.0.16</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h1>PLUGINS</h1>
<p>Settings plugins for reading and writing connection profiles. The
number of available plugins is distribution specific.</p>
<p><em>keyfile</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The keyfile plugin is the generic plugin that supports all the
connection types and capabilities that NetworkManager has. It writes
files out in an .ini-style format in
/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections. See
<strong>nm-settings-keyfile</strong>(5) for details about the file
format.</p>
<p>The stored connection file may contain passwords, secrets and private
keys in plain text, so it will be made readable only to root, and the
plugin will ignore files that are readable or writable by any user or
group other than root. See "Secret flag types" in
<strong>nm-settings</strong>(5) for how to avoid storing passwords in
plain text.</p>
<p>This plugin is always active, and will automatically be used to store
any connections that arent supported by any other active plugin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ifcfg-rh</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This plugin is used on the Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
distributions to read and write configuration from the standard
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files. It currently supports
reading Ethernet, Wi-Fi, InfiniBand, VLAN, Bond, Bridge, and Team
connections. Enabling ifcfg-rh implicitly enables ibft plugin, if it is
available. This can be disabled by adding no-ibft. See
/usr/share/doc/initscripts/sysconfig.txt and
<strong>nm-settings-ifcfg-rh</strong>(5) for more information about the
ifcfg file format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ifupdown</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This plugin is used on the Debian and Ubuntu distributions, and reads
Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections from /etc/network/interfaces.</p>
<p>This plugin is read-only; any connections (of any type) added from
within NetworkManager when you are using this plugin will be saved using
the keyfile plugin instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ibft</em>, <em>no-ibft</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These plugins are deprecated and their selection has no effect. This
is now handled by nm-initrd-generator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ifcfg-suse</em>, <em>ifnet</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These plugins are deprecated and their selection has no effect. The
keyfile plugin should be used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>APPENDIX</h1>
<h2>Device List Format</h2>
<p>The configuration options main.no-auto-default, main.ignore-carrier,
keyfile.unmanaged-devices, connection*.match-device and
device*.match-device select devices based on a list of matchings.
Devices can be specified using the following format:</p>
<p>*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matches every device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IFNAME</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Case sensitive match of interface name of the device. Globbing is not
supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HWADDR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the permanent MAC address of the device. Globbing is not
supported</p>
</blockquote>
<p>interface-name:IFNAME, interface-name:~IFNAME</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Case sensitive match of interface name of the device. Simple globbing
is supported with * and ?. Ranges and escaping is not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>interface-name:=IFNAME</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Case sensitive match of interface name of the device. Globbing is
disabled and IFNAME is taken literally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>mac:HWADDR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the permanent MAC address of the device. Globbing is not
supported</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s390-subchannels:HWADDR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the device based on the subchannel address. Globbing is not
supported</p>
</blockquote>
<p>type:TYPE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the device type. Valid type names are as reported by "nmcli -f
GENERAL.TYPE device show". Globbing is not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>driver:DRIVER</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the device driver as reported by "nmcli -f
GENERAL.DRIVER,GENERAL.DRIVER-VERSION device show". "DRIVER" must match
the driver name exactly and does not support globbing. Optionally, a
driver version may be specified separated by /. Globbing is supported
for the version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>dhcp-plugin:DHCP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the configured DHCP plugin "main.dhcp".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>except:SPEC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Negative match of a device. SPEC must be explicitly qualified with a
prefix such as interface-name:. A negative match has higher priority
then the positive matches above.</p>
<p>If there is a list consisting only of negative matches, the behavior
is the same as if there is also match-all. That means, if none of all
the negative matches is satisfied, the overall result is still a
positive match. That means, "except:interface-name:eth0" is the same as
"*,except:interface-name:eth0".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SPEC[,;]SPEC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple specs can be concatenated with commas or semicolons. The
order does not matter as matches are either inclusive or negative
(except:), with negative matches having higher priority.</p>
<p>Backslash is supported to escape the separators ; and ,, and to
express special characters such as newline (\n), tabulator (\t),
whitespace (\s) and backslash (\\). The globbing of interface names
cannot be escaped. Whitespace is not a separator but will be trimmed
between two specs (unless escaped as \s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>interface-name:em4
mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface-name:eth2
interface-name:vboxnet*,except:interface-name:vboxnet2
*,except:mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Connection List Format</h2>
<p>Connections can be specified using the following format:</p>
<p>*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matches every connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>uuid:UUID</p>

<p>Match the connection by UUID, for example
"uuid:83037490-1d17-4986-a397-01f1db3a7fc2"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>id=ID</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the connection by name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>origin:ORIGIN</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the connection by origin, stored in the
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.origin tag of the user setting. For
example, use "except:origin:nm-initrd-generator" to forbid activation of
connections created by the initrd generator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>except:SPEC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Negative match of a connection. A negative match has higher priority
then the positive matches above.</p>
<p>If there is a list consisting only of negative matches, the behavior
is the same as if there is also match-all. That means, if none of all
the negative matches is satisfied, the overall result is still a
positive match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SPEC[,;]SPEC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple specs can be concatenated with commas or semicolons. The
order does not matter as matches are either inclusive or negative
(except:), with negative matches having higher priority.</p>
<p>Backslash is supported to escape the separators ; and ,, and to
express special characters such as newline (\n), tabulator (\t),
whitespace (\s) and backslash (\\). Whitespace is not a separator but
will be trimmed between two specs (unless escaped as \s).</p>
