<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-canon630u - SANE backend for the Canon 630u USB flatbed
scanner</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-canon630u</strong> library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the following
Canon flatbed scanners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CanoScan 630u<br />
CanoScan 636u<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Color scanning is supported at 75, 150, 300, and 600 dpi, and gamma
and analog gain are adjustable.</p>
<p>TESTERS ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports and comments to Nathan
Rutman <em>&lt;nthn1@yahoo.com&gt;</em>.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>canon630u.conf</em> file is a list of device
names that correspond to Canon USB scanners. Empty lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Only one device name can be
listed in <em>canon630u.conf</em>. The program
<strong>sane-find-scanner</strong>(1) helps to find out the correct
device. Under Linux, such a device name could be
<em>/dev/usb/scanner0</em> for example. See <strong>sane-usb</strong>(5)
for details.</p>
<p>This product-specific scanner driver uses the lower-level kernel USB
driver "scanner". Check for "Driver=usbscanner" under
<em>/proc/bus/usb/devices</em>. If "Driver=(none)", try forcing it with
<em>insmod scanner vendor=0x04a9 product=0x2204</em></p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Due to Canon's unwillingness to provide scanner documentation, this
software was developed by analyzing the USB traffic of the Windows 2000
driver. So things like the calibration procedure I kind of made up; it
seems to work for my scanner. If you have complaints, let me know.</p>
<p>This driver requires the ability to send USB Control Messages,
available in kernel 2.4.12 or later.</p>
<p>Some users have reported that this driver doesn't work at all. This
seems to be a hardware specific issue, although I dsane-uson't know what
exactly the problem is. If you are having problems, please send me the
info in <em>/proc/bus/usb/devices</em>, <em>/proc/pci</em>, the kernel
<em>scanner.c</em> driver version from <em>/var/log/messages</em>, and
the output from <em>SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage &gt;
/dev/null</em></p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/canon630u.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The backend configuration file (see also description of
<strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon630u.a</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon630u.so</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/tmp/canon.cal</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The calibration file used to normalize pixel brightness. This is
calculated every time the scanner is first used after it has lost power.
Deleting this file will force recalibration.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in <em>/etc/sane.d</em>. If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories <em>tmp/config</em>,
<em>.</em>, and <em>/etc/sane.d</em> being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. Higher
debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage &gt; /dev/null</p>
</dd>
</dl>
