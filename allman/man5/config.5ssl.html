<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>config - OpenSSL CONF library configuration files</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This page documents the syntax of OpenSSL configuration files, as
parsed by <strong>NCONF_load</strong> (3) and related functions. This
format is used by many of the OpenSSL commands, and to initialize the
libraries when used by any application.</p>
<p>The first part describes the general syntax of the configuration
files, and subsequent sections describe the semantics of individual
modules. Other modules are described in <strong>fips_config</strong> (5)
and <strong>x509v3_config</strong> (5). The syntax for defining ASN.1
values is described in <strong>ASN1_generate_nconf</strong> (3).</p>
<h1>SYNTAX</h1>
<p>A configuration file is a series of lines. Blank lines, and
whitespace between the elements of a line, have no significance. A
comment starts with a <strong>#</strong> character; the rest of the line
is ignored. If the <strong>#</strong> is the first non-space character
in a line, the entire line is ignored.</p>
<h2>Directives</h2>
<p>Two directives can be used to control the parsing of configuration
files: <strong>.include</strong> and <strong>.pragma</strong>.</p>
<p>For compatibility with older versions of OpenSSL, an equal sign after
the directive will be ignored. Older versions will treat it as an
assignment, so care should be taken if the difference in semantics is
important.</p>
<p>A file can include other files using the include syntax:</p>
<p>.include [=] pathname</p>
<p>If <strong>pathname</strong> is a simple filename, that file is
included directly at that point. Included files can have
<strong>.include</strong> statements that specify other files. If
<strong>pathname</strong> is a directory, all files within that
directory that have a <code>.cnf</code> or <code>.conf</code> extension
will be included. (This is only available on systems with POSIX IO
support.) Any sub-directories found inside the <strong>pathname</strong>
are <strong>ignored</strong>. Similarly, if a file is opened while
scanning a directory, and that file has an <strong>.include</strong>
directive that specifies a directory, that is also ignored.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the <strong>pathname</strong> should be an
absolute path; this can be enforced with the <strong>abspath</strong>
and <strong>includedir</strong> pragmas, described below. The
environment variable <strong>OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE</strong>, if it
exists, is prepended to all relative pathnames. If the pathname is still
relative, it is interpreted based on the current working directory.</p>
<p>To require all file inclusions to name absolute paths, use the
following directive:</p>
<p>.pragma [=] abspath:value</p>
<p>The default behavior, where the <strong>value</strong> is
<strong>false</strong> or <strong>off</strong>, is to allow relative
paths. To require all <strong>.include</strong> pathnames to be absolute
paths, use a <strong>value</strong> of <strong>true</strong> or
<strong>on</strong>.</p>
<p>In these files, the dollar sign, <strong>$</strong>, is used to
reference a variable, as described below. On some platforms, however, it
is common to treat <strong>$</strong> as a regular character in symbol
names. Supporting this behavior can be done with the following
directive:</p>
<p>.pragma [=] dollarid:value</p>
<p>The default behavior, where the <strong>value</strong> is
<strong>false</strong> or <strong>off</strong>, is to treat the
dollarsign as indicating a variable name; <code>foo$bar</code> is
interpreted as <code>foo</code> followed by the expansion of the
variable <code>bar</code>. If <strong>value</strong> is
<strong>true</strong> or <strong>on</strong>, then <code>foo$bar</code>
is a single seven-character name and variable expansions must be
specified using braces or parentheses.</p>
<p>.pragma [=] includedir:value</p>
<p>If a relative pathname is specified in the <strong>.include</strong>
directive, and the <strong>OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE</strong> environment
variable doesn't exist, then the value of the
<strong>includedir</strong> pragma, if it exists, is prepended to the
pathname.</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>A configuration file is divided into a number of <em>sections</em>. A
section begins with the section name in square brackets, and ends when a
new section starts, or at the end of the file. The section name can
consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores. Whitespace between
the name and the brackets is removed.</p>
<p>The first section of a configuration file is special and is referred
to as the <strong>default</strong> section. This section is usually
unnamed and spans from the start of file until the first named section.
When a name is being looked up, it is first looked up in the current or
named section, and then the default section if necessary.</p>
<p>The environment is mapped onto a section called
<strong>ENV</strong>.</p>
<p>Within a section are a series of name/value assignments, described in
more detail below. As a reminder, the square brackets shown in this
example are required, not optional:</p>
<p>[ section ] name1 = This is value1 name2 = Another value ... [
newsection ] name1 = New value1 name3 = Value 3</p>
<p>The <strong>name</strong> can contain any alphanumeric characters as
well as a few punctuation symbols such as <strong>.</strong>
<strong>,</strong> <strong>;</strong> and <strong>_</strong>. Whitespace
after the name and before the equal sign is ignored.</p>
<p>If a name is repeated in the same section, then all but the last
value are ignored. In certain circumstances, such as with Certificate
DNs, the same field may occur multiple times. In order to support this,
commands like <strong>openssl-req</strong> (1) ignore any leading text
that is preceded with a period. For example:</p>
<p>1.OU = First OU 2.OU = Second OU</p>
<p>The <strong>value</strong> consists of the string following the
<strong>=</strong> character until end of line with any leading and
trailing whitespace removed.</p>
<p>The value string undergoes variable expansion. The text
<code>$var</code> or <code>${var}</code> inserts the value of the named
variable from the current section. To use a value from another section
use <code>$section::name</code> or <code>${section::name}</code>. By
using <code>$ENV::name</code>, the value of the specified environment
variable will be substituted.</p>
<p>Variables must be defined before their value is referenced, otherwise
an error is flagged and the file will not load. This can be worked
around by specifying a default value in the <strong>default</strong>
section before the variable is used.</p>
<p>Any name/value settings in an <strong>ENV</strong> section are
available to the configuration file, but are not propagated to the
environment.</p>
<p>It is an error if the value ends up longer than 64k.</p>
<p>It is possible to escape certain characters by using a single
<strong>'</strong> or double <strong>"</strong> quote around the value,
or using a backslash <strong>\</strong> before the character, By making
the last character of a line a <strong>\</strong> a
<strong>value</strong> string can be spread across multiple lines. In
addition the sequences <strong>\n</strong>, <strong>\r</strong>,
<strong>\b</strong> and <strong>\t</strong> are recognized.</p>
<p>The expansion and escape rules as described above that apply to
<strong>value</strong> also apply to the pathname of the
<strong>.include</strong> directive.</p>
<h1>OPENSSL LIBRARY CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The sections below use the informal term <em>module</em> to refer to
a part of the OpenSSL functionality. This is not the same as the formal
term <em>FIPS module</em>, for example.</p>
<p>The OpenSSL configuration looks up the value of
<strong>openssl_conf</strong> in the default section and takes that as
the name of a section that specifies how to configure any modules in the
library. It is not an error to leave any module in its default
configuration. An application can specify a different name by calling
<strong>CONF_modules_load_file()</strong>, for example, directly.</p>
<p>OpenSSL also looks up the value of
<strong>config_diagnostics</strong>. If this exists and has a nonzero
numeric value, any error suppressing flags passed to
<strong>CONF_modules_load()</strong> will be ignored. This is useful for
diagnosing misconfigurations but its use in production requires
additional consideration. With this option enabled, a configuration
error will completely prevent access to a service. Without this option
and in the presence of a configuration error, access will be allowed but
the desired configuration will <strong>not</strong> be used.</p>
<p># These must be in the default section config_diagnostics = 1
openssl_conf = openssl_init [openssl_init] oid_section = oids providers
= providers alg_section = evp_properties ssl_conf = ssl_configuration
engines = engines random = random [oids] ... new oids here ...
[providers] ... provider stuff here ... [evp_properties] ... EVP
properties here ... [ssl_configuration] ... SSL/TLS configuration
properties here ... [engines] ... engine properties here ... [random]
... random properties here ...</p>
<p>The semantics of each module are described below. The phrase in the
initialization section refers to the section identified by the
<strong>openssl_conf</strong> or other name (given as
<strong>openssl_init</strong> in the example above). The examples below
assume the configuration above is used to specify the individual
sections.</p>
<h2>ASN.1 Object Identifier Configuration</h2>
<p>The name <strong>oid_section</strong> in the initialization section
names the section containing name/value pairs of OID's. The name is the
short name; the value is an optional long name followed by a comma, and
the numeric value. While some OpenSSL commands have their own section
for specifying OID's, this section makes them available to all commands
and applications.</p>
<p>[oids] shortName = a very long OID name, 1.2.3.4 newoid1 = 1.2.3.4.1
some_other_oid = 1.2.3.5</p>
<p>If a full configuration with the above fragment is in the file
<em>example.cnf</em>, then the following command line:</p>
<p>OPENSSL_CONF=example.cnf openssl asn1parse -genstr OID:1.2.3.4.1</p>
<p>will output:</p>
<p>0:d=0 hl=2 l= 4 prim: OBJECT :newoid1</p>
<p>showing that the OID newoid1 has been added as 1.2.3.4.1.</p>
<h2>Provider Configuration</h2>
<p>The name <strong>providers</strong> in the initialization section
names the section containing cryptographic provider configuration. The
name/value assignments in this section each name a provider, and point
to the configuration section for that provider. The provider-specific
section is used to specify how to load the module, activate it, and set
other parameters.</p>
<p>Within a provider section, the following names have meaning:</p>
<dl>
<dt>identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is used to specify an alternate name, overriding the default
name specified in the list of providers. For example: [providers] foo =
foo_provider [foo_provider] identity = my_fips_module</p>
</dd>
<dt>module</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the pathname of the module (typically a shared library) to
load.</p>
</dd>
<dt>activate</dt>
<dd>
<p>If present, the module is activated. The value assigned to this name
is not significant.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All parameters in the section as well as sub-sections are made
available to the provider.</p>
<p><em>Default provider and its activation</em></p>
<p>If no providers are activated explicitly, the default one is
activated implicitly. See <strong>OSSL_PROVIDER-default</strong> (7) for
more details.</p>
<p>If you add a section explicitly activating any other provider(s), you
most probably need to explicitly activate the default provider,
otherwise it becomes unavailable in openssl. It may make the system
remotely unavailable.</p>
<h2>EVP Configuration</h2>
<p>The name <strong>alg_section</strong> in the initialization section
names the section containing algorithmic properties when using the
<strong>EVP</strong> API.</p>
<p>Within the algorithm properties section, the following names have
meaning:</p>
<dl>
<dt>default_properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value may be anything that is acceptable as a property query
string for <strong>EVP_set_default_properties()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fips_mode (deprecated)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value is a boolean that can be <strong>yes</strong> or
<strong>no</strong>. If the value is <strong>yes</strong>, this is
exactly equivalent to: default_properties = fips=yes If the value is
<strong>no</strong>, nothing happens. Using this name is deprecated, and
if used, it must be the only name in the section.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>SSL Configuration</h2>
<p>The name <strong>ssl_conf</strong> in the initialization section
names the section containing the list of SSL/TLS configurations. As with
the providers, each name in this section identifies a section with the
configuration for that name. For example:</p>
<p>[ssl_configuration] server = server_tls_config client =
client_tls_config system_default = tls_system_default
[server_tls_config] ... configuration for SSL/TLS servers ...
[client_tls_config] ... configuration for SSL/TLS clients ...</p>
<p>The configuration name <strong>system_default</strong> has a special
meaning. If it exists, it is applied whenever an
<strong>SSL_CTX</strong> object is created. For example, to impose
system-wide minimum TLS and DTLS protocol versions:</p>
<p>[tls_system_default] MinProtocol = TLSv1.2 MinProtocol = DTLSv1.2</p>
<p>The minimum TLS protocol is applied to <strong>SSL_CTX</strong>
objects that are TLS-based, and the minimum DTLS protocol to those are
DTLS-based. The same applies also to maximum versions set with
<strong>MaxProtocol</strong>.</p>
<p>Each configuration section consists of name/value pairs that are
parsed by <strong>SSL_CONF_cmd (3)</strong>, which will be called by
<strong>SSL_CTX_config()</strong> or <strong>SSL_config()</strong>,
appropriately. Note that any characters before an initial dot in the
configuration section are ignored, so that the same command can be used
multiple times. This probably is most useful for loading different key
types, as shown here:</p>
<p>[server_tls_config] RSA.Certificate = server-rsa.pem
ECDSA.Certificate = server-ecdsa.pem</p>
<h2>Engine Configuration</h2>
<p>The name <strong>engines</strong> in the initialization section names
the section containing the list of ENGINE configurations. As with the
providers, each name in this section identifies an engine with the
configuration for that engine. The engine-specific section is used to
specify how to load the engine, activate it, and set other
parameters.</p>
<p>Within an engine section, the following names have meaning:</p>
<dl>
<dt>engine_id</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is used to specify an alternate name, overriding the default
name specified in the list of engines. If present, it must be first. For
example: [engines] foo = foo_engine [foo_engine] engine_id = myfoo</p>
</dd>
<dt>dynamic_path</dt>
<dd>
<p>This loads and adds an ENGINE from the given path. It is equivalent
to sending the ctrls <strong>SO_PATH</strong> with the path argument
followed by <strong>LIST_ADD</strong> with value <strong>2</strong> and
<strong>LOAD</strong> to the dynamic ENGINE. If this is not the required
behaviour then alternative ctrls can be sent directly to the dynamic
ENGINE using ctrl commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt>init</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies whether to initialize the ENGINE. If the value is
<strong>0</strong> the ENGINE will not be initialized, if the value is
<strong>1</strong> an attempt is made to initialize the ENGINE
immediately. If the <strong>init</strong> command is not present then an
attempt will be made to initialize the ENGINE after all commands in its
section have been processed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>default_algorithms</dt>
<dd>
<p>This sets the default algorithms an ENGINE will supply using the
function <strong>ENGINE_set_default_string()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All other names are taken to be the name of a ctrl command that is
sent to the ENGINE, and the value is the argument passed with the
command. The special value <strong>EMPTY</strong> means no value is sent
with the command. For example:</p>
<p>[engines] foo = foo_engine [foo_engine] dynamic_path =
/some/path/fooengine.so some_ctrl = some_value default_algorithms = ALL
other_ctrl = EMPTY</p>
<h2>Random Configuration</h2>
<p>The name <strong>random</strong> in the initialization section names
the section containing the random number generator settings.</p>
<p>Within the random section, the following names have meaning:</p>
<dl>
<dt>random</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is used to specify the random bit generator. For example:
[random] random = CTR-DRBG The available random bit generators are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>CTR-DRBG</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>HASH-DRBG</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>HMAC-DRBG</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>cipher</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This specifies what cipher a <strong>CTR-DRBG</strong> random bit
generator will use. Other random bit generators ignore this name. The
default value is <strong>AES-256-CTR</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>digest</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies what digest the <strong>HASH-DRBG</strong> or
<strong>HMAC-DRBG</strong> random bit generators will use. Other random
bit generators ignore this name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>This sets the property query used when fetching the random bit
generator and any underlying algorithms.</p>
</dd>
<dt>seed</dt>
<dd>
<p>This sets the randomness source that should be used. By default
<strong>SEED-SRC</strong> will be used outside of the FIPS provider. The
FIPS provider uses call backs to access the same randomness sources from
outside the validated boundary.</p>
</dd>
<dt>seed_properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>This sets the property query used when fetching the randomness
source.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example shows how to use quoting and escaping.</p>
<p># This is the default section. HOME = /temp configdir =
$ENV::HOME/config [ section_one ] # Quotes permit leading and trailing
whitespace any = " any variable name " other = A string that can \ cover
several lines \ by including \\ characters message = Hello World\n [
section_two ] greeting = $section_one::message</p>
<p>This example shows how to expand environment variables safely. In
this example, the variable <strong>tempfile</strong> is intended to
refer to a temporary file, and the environment variable
<strong>TEMP</strong> or <strong>TMP</strong>, if present, specify the
directory where the file should be put. Since the default section is
checked if a variable does not exist, it is possible to set
<strong>TMP</strong> to default to <em>/tmp</em>, and
<strong>TEMP</strong> to default to <strong>TMP</strong>.</p>
<p># These two lines must be in the default section. TMP = /tmp TEMP =
$ENV::TMP # This can be used anywhere tmpfile =
${ENV::TEMP}/tmp.filename</p>
<p>This example shows how to enforce FIPS mode for the application
<em>sample</em>.</p>
<p>sample = fips_config [fips_config] alg_section = evp_properties
[evp_properties] default_properties = "fips=yes"</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt>OPENSSL_CONF</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to the config file, or the empty string for none. Ignored in
set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OPENSSL_ENGINES</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to the engines directory. Ignored in set-user-ID and
set-group-ID programs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OPENSSL_MODULES</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to the directory with OpenSSL modules, such as providers.
Ignored in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE</dt>
<dd>
<p>The optional path to prepend to all <strong>.include</strong>
paths.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>There is no way to include characters using the octal
<strong>\nnn</strong> form. Strings are all null terminated so nulls
cannot form part of the value.</p>
<p>The escaping isn't quite right: if you want to use sequences like
<strong>\n</strong> you can't use any quote escaping on the same
line.</p>
<p>The limit that only one directory can be opened and read at a time
can be considered a bug and should be fixed.</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>An undocumented API, <strong>NCONF_WIN32()</strong>, used a slightly
different set of parsing rules there were intended to be tailored to the
Microsoft Windows platform. Specifically, the backslash character was
not an escape character and could be used in pathnames, only the
double-quote character was recognized, and comments began with a
semi-colon. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0; applications
with configuration files using that syntax will have to be modified.</p>
