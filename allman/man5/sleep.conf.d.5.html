<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd-sleep.conf, sleep.conf.d - Suspend and hibernation
configuration file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</p>
<p>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/run/systemd/sleep.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>systemd</strong> supports four general power-saving
modes:</p>
<p>suspend</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a low-power state where execution of the OS is paused, and complete
power loss might result in lost data, and which is fast to enter and
exit. This corresponds to suspend, standby, or freeze states as
understood by the kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hibernate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a low-power state where execution of the OS is paused, and complete
power loss does not result in lost data, and which might be slow to
enter and exit. This corresponds to the hibernation as understood by the
kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hybrid-sleep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a low-power state where execution of the OS is paused, which might be
slow to enter, and on complete power loss does not result in lost data
but might be slower to exit in that case. This mode is called
suspend-to-both by the kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>suspend-then-hibernate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A low power state where the system is initially suspended (the state
is stored in RAM). If the system supports low-battery alarms (ACPI
_BTP), then the system will be woken up by the ACPI low-battery signal
and hibernated (the state is then stored on disk). Also, if not
interrupted within the timespan specified by <em>HibernateDelaySec=</em>
or the estimated timespan until the system battery charge level goes
down to 5%, then the system will be woken up by the RTC alarm and
hibernated. The estimated timespan is calculated from the change of the
battery capacity level after the time specified by
<em>SuspendEstimationSec=</em> or when the system is woken up from the
suspend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Settings in these files determine what strings will be written to
/sys/power/disk and /sys/power/state by
<strong>systemd-sleep</strong>(8) when <strong>systemd</strong>(1)
attempts to suspend or hibernate the machine. See
<strong>systemd.syntax</strong>(7) for a general description of the
syntax.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1>
<p>The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration
is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults.
Initially, the main configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains
commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by
creating drop-ins, as described below. Using drop-ins for local
configuration is recommended over modifications to the main
configuration file.</p>
<p>In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration
snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those
drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration
file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option,
for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file
sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.</p>
<p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install
drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local
administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration
files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override
package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower
precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the
ordering of the files.</p>
<p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
file.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options can be configured in the [Sleep] section of
/etc/systemd/sleep.conf or a sleep.conf.d file:</p>
<p><em>AllowSuspend=</em>, <em>AllowHibernation=</em>,
<em>AllowSuspendThenHibernate=</em>, <em>AllowHybridSleep=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default any power-saving mode is advertised if possible (i.e. the
kernel supports that mode, the necessary resources are available). Those
switches can be used to disable specific modes.</p>
<p>If <em>AllowHibernation=no</em> or <em>AllowSuspend=no</em> is used,
this implies <em>AllowSuspendThenHibernate=no</em> and
<em>AllowHybridSleep=no</em>, since those methods use both suspend and
hibernation internally. <em>AllowSuspendThenHibernate=yes</em> and
<em>AllowHybridSleep=yes</em> can be used to override and enable those
specific modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SuspendMode=</em>, <em>HibernateMode=</em>,
<em>HybridSleepMode=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The string to be written to /sys/power/disk by, respectively,
<strong>systemd-suspend.service</strong>(8),
<strong>systemd-hibernate.service</strong>(8), or
<strong>systemd-hybrid-sleep.service</strong>(8). More than one value
can be specified by separating multiple values with whitespace. They
will be tried in turn, until one is written without error. If none of
the writes succeed, the operation will be aborted.</p>
<p>The allowed set of values is determined by the kernel and is shown in
the file itself (use <strong>cat /sys/power/disk</strong> to display).
See <strong>the kernel documentation</strong>[1] for more details.</p>
<p><strong>systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service</strong>(8) uses the
value of <em>SuspendMode=</em> when suspending and the value of
<em>HibernateMode=</em> when hibernating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SuspendState=</em>, <em>HibernateState=</em>,
<em>HybridSleepState=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The string to be written to /sys/power/state by, respectively,
<strong>systemd-suspend.service</strong>(8),
<strong>systemd-hibernate.service</strong>(8), or
<strong>systemd-hybrid-sleep.service</strong>(8). More than one value
can be specified by separating multiple values with whitespace. They

<p><strong>systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service</strong>(8) uses the
value of <em>SuspendState=</em> when suspending and the value of
<em>HibernateState=</em> when hibernating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>HibernateDelaySec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of time the system spends in suspend mode before the
system is automatically put into hibernate mode. Only used by
<strong>systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service</strong>(8). If the
system has a battery, then defaults to the estimated timespan until the
system battery charge level goes down to 5%. If the system has no
battery, then defaults to 2h.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>SuspendEstimationSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RTC alarm will wake the system after the specified timespan to
measure the system battery capacity level and estimate battery
discharging rate, which is used for estimating timespan until the system
battery charge level goes down to 5%. Only used by
<strong>systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service</strong>(8). Defaults to
1h.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>EXAMPLE: FREEZE</h1>
<p>Example: to exploit the “freeze” mode added in Linux 3.9, one can use
<strong>systemctl suspend</strong> with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Sleep]
SuspendState=freeze</code></pre>
</blockquote>
