<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>adjtime_config - information about hardware clock setting and drift
factor</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em>/etc/adjtime</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The file <em>/etc/adjtime</em> contains descriptive information about
the hardware mode clock setting and clock drift factor. The file is read
and write by <strong>hwclock</strong>(8); and read by programs like
rtcwake to get RTC time mode.</p>
<p>The file is usually located in <em>/etc</em>, but tools like
<strong>hwclock</strong>(8) or <strong>rtcwake</strong>(8) can use
alternative location by command line options if write access to
<em>/etc</em> is unwanted. The default clock mode is "UTC" if the file
is missing.</p>
<p>The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate. However, much of its
inaccuracy is completely predictable - it gains or loses the same amount
of time every day. This is called systematic drift. The util
<strong>hwclock</strong>(8) keeps the file <em>/etc/adjtime</em>, that
keeps some historical information. For more details see "<strong>The
Adjust Function</strong>" and "<strong>The Adjtime File</strong>"
sections from <strong>hwclock</strong>(8) man page.</p>
<p>The <em>adjtime</em> file is formatted in ASCII.</p>
<h2>First line</h2>
<p>Three numbers, separated by blanks:</p>
<p><strong>drift factor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the systematic drift rate in seconds per day (floating point
decimal)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>last adjust time</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent
adjustment or calibration (decimal integer)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>adjustment status</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>zero (for compatibility with <strong>clock</strong>(8)) as a floating
point decimal</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Second line</h2>
<p><strong>last calibration time</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent
calibration. Zero if there has been no calibration yet or it is known
that any previous calibration is moot (for example, because the Hardware
Clock has been found, since that calibration, not to contain a valid
time). This is a decimal integer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Third line</h2>
<p><strong>clock mode</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supported values are <strong>UTC</strong> or <strong>LOCAL</strong>.
Tells whether the Hardware Clock is set to Coordinated Universal Time or
local time. You can always override this value with options on the
<strong>hwclock</strong>(8) command line.</p>
