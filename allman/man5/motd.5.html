<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>motd - message of the day</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

<strong>pam_motd</strong>(8) <strong>login</strong>(1) after a
successful login but just before it executes the login shell.</p>
<p>The abbreviation "motd" stands for "message of the day", and this
file has been traditionally used for exactly that (it requires much less
disk space than mail to all users).</p>
<p>On Debian GNU/Linux, dynamic content configured at
<em>/etc/pam.d/login</em> is also displayed by <em>pam_exec</em>.</p>
