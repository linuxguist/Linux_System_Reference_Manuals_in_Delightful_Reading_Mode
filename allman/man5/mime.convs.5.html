<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>mime.convs - mime type conversion file for cups (deprecated)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>mime.convs</strong> file defines the filters that are
available for converting files from one format to another. The standard
filters support text, PDF, PostScript, and many types of image
files.</p>
<p>Additional filters are specified in files with the extension
<em>.convs</em> in the CUPS configuration directory.</p>
<p>Each line in the <strong>mime.convs</strong> file is a comment,
blank, or filter line. Comment lines start with the # character. Filter
lines specify the source and destination MIME types along with a
relative cost associated with the filter and the filter to run:</p>
<pre><code>
    source/type destination/type cost filter
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>source/type</em> field specifies the source MIME media type
that is consumed by the filter.</p>
<p>The <em>destination/type</em> field specifies the destination MIME
media type that is produced by the filter.</p>
<p>The <em>cost</em> field specifies the relative cost for running the
filter. A value of 100 means that the filter uses a large amount of
resources while a value of 0 means that the filter uses very few
resources.</p>
<p>The <em>filter</em> field specifies the filter program filename.
Filenames are relative to the CUPS filter directory.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p><em>/etc/cups</em> - Typical CUPS configuration directory.<br />
<em>/usr/lib/cups/filter</em> - Typical CUPS filter directory.<br />
<em>/usr/libexec/cups/filter</em> - CUPS filter directory on macOS.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Define a filter that converts PostScript documents to CUPS Raster
format:</p>
<pre><code>
    application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
</code></pre>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>CUPS filters are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
future feature release of CUPS. Printers that do not support IPP can be
supported using applications such as
<strong>ippeveprinter</strong>(1).</p>
