<h1>NAME</h1>
<p><strong>papersize</strong> - specify preferred paper size</p>
<h1>SYNOPSYS</h1>
<p><strong>/etc/papersize</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>papersize</strong> file is used to specify the preferred
paper size to use by available commands and programs generating
documents.</p>
<p>The format of this file is extremely simple: whitespace and anything
starting with `#' is ignored, and the name of the paper is the first
string found; the case in the name of the paper does not import (see
<strong>CAVEATS</strong> section however).</p>
<h1>PAPER NAMES</h1>
<p>The following names are commonly understood by programs:
<strong>a3</strong>, <strong>a4</strong>, <strong>a5</strong>,
<strong>b5</strong>, <strong>letter</strong>, <strong>legal</strong>,
<strong>executive</strong>, <strong>note</strong> and
<strong>11x17</strong>.</p>
<p>Additional paper names that one may encounter are:
<strong>a0</strong>, <strong>a1</strong>, <strong>a2</strong>,
<strong>a6</strong>, <strong>a7</strong>, <strong>a8</strong>,
<strong>a9</strong>, <strong>a10</strong>, <strong>b0</strong>,
<strong>b1</strong>, <strong>b2</strong>, <strong>b3</strong>,
<strong>b4</strong>, <strong>tabloid</strong>,
<strong>statement</strong>, <strong>note</strong>,
<strong>halfletter</strong>, <strong>halfexecutive</strong>,
<strong>folio</strong>, <strong>quarto</strong>,
<strong>ledger</strong>, <strong>archA</strong>, <strong>archB</strong>,
<strong>archC</strong>, <strong>archD</strong>, <strong>archE</strong>,
<strong>flsa</strong>, <strong>flse</strong>, <strong>csheet</strong>,
<strong>dsheet</strong>, <strong>esheet</strong> and
<strong>10x14</strong>.</p>
<p>The value of the <strong>papersize</strong> file can be overridden by
looking in order at the <strong>PAPERSIZE</strong> environment variable,
then at the contents of the file specified by the
<strong>PAPERCONF</strong> environment variable. If the
<strong>papersize</strong> file does not exist, programs using the paper
library default to using <strong>letter</strong> as a fall-back
value</p>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>This manual page documents the format of the
<strong>papersize</strong> file that is read by the
<strong>libpaper</strong> library. Some programs that read this file do
not yet use the library and may have trouble ignoring whitespace and
comments in the file; they may also require that the paper names use a
specific capitalization.</p>
