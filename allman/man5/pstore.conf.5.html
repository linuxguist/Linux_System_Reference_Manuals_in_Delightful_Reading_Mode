<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pstore.conf, pstore.conf.d - PStore configuration file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/systemd/pstore.conf /etc/systemd/pstore.conf.d/*</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This file configures the behavior of
<strong>systemd-pstore</strong>(8), a tool for archiving the contents of
the persistent storage filesystem, <strong>pstore</strong>[1].</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1>
<p>The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration
is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults.
Initially, the main configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains
commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by
creating drop-ins, as described below. Using drop-ins for local
configuration is recommended over modifications to the main
configuration file.</p>
<p>In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration
snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those
drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration
file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option,
for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file
sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.</p>
<p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install
drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local
administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration
files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override
package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower
precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the
ordering of the files.</p>
<p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
file.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>All options are configured in the [PStore] section:</p>
<p><em>Storage=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls where to archive (i.e. copy) files from the pstore
filesystem. One of "none", "external", and "journal". When "none", the
tool exits without processing files in the pstore filesystem. When
"external" (the default), files are archived into
/var/lib/systemd/pstore/, and logged into the journal. When "journal",
pstore file contents are logged only in the journal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Unlink=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls whether or not files are removed from pstore after
processing. Takes a boolean value. When true, a pstore file is removed
from the pstore once it has been archived (either to disk or into the
journal). When false, processing of pstore files occurs normally, but
the files remain in the pstore. The default is true in order to maintain
the pstore in a nearly empty state, so that the pstore has storage
available for the next kernel error event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the template
/etc/systemd/pstore.conf file that is installed by default.</p>
