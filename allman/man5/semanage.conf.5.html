<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>semanage.conf - global configuration file for the SELinux Management
library</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>semanage.conf</strong> file is usually located under the
directory /etc/selinux and it is used for run-time configuration of the
behavior of the SELinux Management library.</p>
<p>Each line should contain a configuration parameter followed by the
equal sign ("=") and then followed by the configuration value for that
parameter. Anything after the "#" symbol is ignored similarly to empty
lines.</p>
<p>The following parameters are allowed:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>module-store</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify how the SELinux Management library should interact with the
SELinux policy store. When set to "direct", the SELinux Management
library writes to the SELinux policy module store directly (this is the
default setting). Otherwise a socket path or a server name can be used
for the argument. If the argument begins with "/" (as in "/foo/bar"), it
represents the path to a named socket that should be used to connect the
policy management server. If the argument does not begin with a "/" (as
in "example.com:4242"), it should be interpreted as the name of a remote
policy management server to be used through a TCP connection (default
port is 4242 unless a different one is specified after the server name
using the colon to separate the two fields).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>root</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify an alternative root path to use for the store. The default is
"/"</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>store-root</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify an alternative store_root path to use. The default is
"/var/lib/selinux"</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>compiler-directory</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify an alternative directory that contains HLL to CIL compilers.
The default value is "/usr/libexec/selinux/hll".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>ignore-module-cache</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether or not to ignore the cache of CIL modules compiled from HLL.
It can be set to either "true" or "false" and is set to "false" by
default. If the cache is ignored, then all CIL modules are recompiled
from their HLL modules.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>policy-version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When generating the policy, by default <strong>semanage</strong> will
set the policy version to POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX, as defined in
&lt;sepol/policydb/policydb.h&gt;. Change this setting if a different
version needs to be set for the policy.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>target-platform</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The target platform to generate policies for. Valid values are
"selinux" and "xen", and is set to "selinux" by default.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>expand-check</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether or not to check "neverallow" rules when executing all
<strong>semanage</strong> command. It can be set to either "0"
(disabled) or "1" (enabled) and by default it is enabled. There might be
a large penalty in execution time if this option is enabled.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>file-mode</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>By default the permission mode for the run-time policy files is set
to 0644.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>save-previous</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>It controls whether the previous module directory is saved after a
successful commit to the policy store and it can be set to either "true"
or "false". By default it is set to "false" (the previous version is
deleted).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>save-linked</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>It controls whether the previously linked module is saved (with name
"base.linked") after a successful commit to the policy store. It can be
set to either "true" or "false" and by default it is set to "false" (the
previous module is deleted).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>ignoredirs</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>List, separated by ";", of directories to ignore when setting up
users homedirs. Some distributions use this to stop labeling /root as a
homedir.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>usepasswd</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether or not to enable the use getpwent() to obtain a list of home
directories to label. It can be set to either "true" or "false". By
default it is set to "true".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>disable-genhomedircon</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>It controls whether or not the genhomedircon function is executed
when using the <strong>semanage</strong> command and it can be set to
either "false" or "true". By default the genhomedircon functionality is
enabled (equivalent to this option set to "false").</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>handle-unknown</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option overrides the kernel behavior for handling permissions
defined in the kernel but missing from the actual policy. It can be set
to "deny", "reject" or "allow". By default the setting from the policy
is taken.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>bzip-blocksize</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>It should be in the range 0-9. A value of 0 means no compression. By
default the bzip block size is set to 9 (actual block size value is
obtained after multiplication by 100000).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>bzip-small</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When set to "true", the bzip algorithm shall try to reduce its system
memory usage. It can be set to either "true" or "false" and by default
it is set to "false".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>remove-hll</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When set to "true", HLL files will be removed after compilation into
CIL. In order to delete HLL files already compiled into CIL, modules
will need to be recompiled with the <strong>ignore-module-cache</strong>
option set to 'true' or using the <strong>ignore-module-cache</strong>
option with semodule. The remove-hll option can be set to either "true"
or "false" and by default it is set to "false".</p>
<p>Please note that since this option deletes all HLL files, an updated
HLL compiler will not be able to recompile the original HLL file into
CIL. In order to compile the original HLL file into CIL, the same HLL
file will need to be reinstalled.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>optimize-policy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When set to "true", the kernel policy will be optimized upon
rebuilds. It can be set to either "true" or "false" and by default it is
set to "false".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
