<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dnssec-trust-anchors.d, systemd.positive, systemd.negative - DNSSEC
trust anchor configuration files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/*.positive</p>
<p>/run/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/*.positive</p>
<p>/usr/lib/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/*.positive</p>
<p>/etc/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/*.negative</p>
<p>/run/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/*.negative</p>
<p>/usr/lib/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/*.negative</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The DNSSEC trust anchor configuration files define positive and
negative trust anchors <strong>systemd-resolved.service</strong>(8)
bases DNSSEC integrity proofs on.</p>
<h1>POSITIVE TRUST ANCHORS</h1>
<p>Positive trust anchor configuration files contain
<strong>DNSKEY</strong> and <strong>DS</strong> resource record
definitions to use as base for DNSSEC integrity proofs. See <strong>RFC
4035, Section 4.4</strong>[1] for more information about DNSSEC trust
anchors.</p>
<p>Positive trust anchors are read from files with the suffix .positive
located in /etc/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/, /run/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/
and /usr/lib/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/. These directories are searched in
the specified order, and a trust anchor file of the same name in an
earlier path overrides a trust anchor files in a later path. To disable
a trust anchor file shipped in /usr/lib/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/ it is
sufficient to provide an identically-named file in
/etc/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/ or /run/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/ that is
either empty or a symlink to /dev/null ("masked").</p>
<p>Positive trust anchor files are simple text files resembling DNS zone
files, as documented in <strong>RFC 1035, Section 5</strong>[2]. One
<strong>DS</strong> or <strong>DNSKEY</strong> resource record may be
listed per line. Empty lines and lines starting with "#" or ";" are
ignored, which may be used for commenting. A <strong>DS</strong>
resource record is specified like in the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>. IN DS 19036 8 2 49aac11d7b6f6446702e54a1607371607a1a41855200fd2ce1cdde32f24e8fb5</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first word specifies the domain, use "." for the root domain. The
domain may be specified with or without trailing dot, which is
considered equivalent. The second word must be "IN" the third word "DS".
The following words specify the key tag, signature algorithm, digest
algorithm, followed by the hex-encoded key fingerprint. See <strong>RFC
4034, Section 5</strong>[3] for details about the precise syntax and
meaning of these fields.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>DNSKEY</strong> resource records may be used
to define trust anchors, like in the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>. IN DNSKEY 257 3 8 AwEAAagAIKlVZrpC6Ia7gEzahOR+9W29euxhJhVVLOyQbSEW0O8gcCjFFVQUTf6v58fLjwBd0YI0EzrAcQqBGCzh/RStIoO8g0NfnfL2MTJRkxoXbfDaUeVPQuYEhg37NZWAJQ9VnMVDxP/VHL496M/QZxkjf5/Efucp2gaDX6RS6CXpoY68LsvPVjR0ZSwzz1apAzvN9dlzEheX7ICJBBtuA6G3LQpzW5hOA2hzCTMjJPJ8LbqF6dsV6DoBQzgul0sGIcGOYl7OyQdXfZ57relSQageu+ipAdTTJ25AsRTAoub8ONGcLmqrAmRLKBP1dfwhYB4N7knNnulqQxA+Uk1ihz0=</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first word specifies the domain again, the second word must be
"IN", followed by "DNSKEY". The subsequent words encode the
<strong>DNSKEY</strong> flags, protocol and algorithm fields, followed
by the key data encoded in Base64. See <strong>RFC 4034, Section
2</strong>[4] for details about the precise syntax and meaning of these
fields.</p>
<p>If multiple <strong>DS</strong> or <strong>DNSKEY</strong> records
are defined for the same domain (possibly even in different trust anchor
files), all keys are used and are considered equivalent as base for
DNSSEC proofs.</p>
<p>Note that systemd-resolved will automatically use a built-in trust
anchor key for the Internet root domain if no positive trust anchors are
defined for the root domain. In most cases it is hence unnecessary to
define an explicit key with trust anchor files. The built-in key is
disabled as soon as at least one trust anchor key for the root domain is
defined in trust anchor files.</p>
<p>It is generally recommended to encode trust anchors in
<strong>DS</strong> resource records, rather than
<strong>DNSKEY</strong> resource records.</p>
<p>If a trust anchor specified via a <strong>DS</strong> record is found
revoked it is automatically removed from the trust anchor database for
the runtime. See <strong>RFC 5011</strong>[5] for details about revoked
trust anchors. Note that systemd-resolved will not update its trust
anchor database from DNS servers automatically. Instead, it is
recommended to update the resolver software or update the new trust
anchor via adding in new trust anchor files.</p>
<p>The current DNSSEC trust anchor for the Internets root domain is
available at the <strong>IANA Trust Anchor and Keys</strong>[6]
page.</p>
<h1>NEGATIVE TRUST ANCHORS</h1>
<p>Negative trust anchors define domains where DNSSEC validation shall
be turned off. Negative trust anchor files are found at the same
location as positive trust anchor files, and follow the same overriding
rules. They are text files with the .negative suffix. Empty lines and
lines whose first character is ";" are ignored. Each line specifies one
domain name which is the root of a DNS subtree where validation shall be
disabled. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># Reverse IPv4 mappings
10.in-addr.arpa
16.172.in-addr.arpa
168.192.in-addr.arpa
...
# Some custom domains
prod
stag</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Negative trust anchors are useful to support private DNS subtrees
that are not referenced from the Internet DNS hierarchy, and not
signed.</p>
<p><strong>RFC 7646</strong>[7] for details on negative trust
anchors.</p>
<p>If no negative trust anchor files are configured a built-in set of
well-known private DNS zone domains is used as negative trust
anchors.</p>
<p>It is also possibly to define per-interface negative trust anchors
using the <em>DNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors=</em> setting in
<strong>systemd.network</strong>(5) files.</p>
