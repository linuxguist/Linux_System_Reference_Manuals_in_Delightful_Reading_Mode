<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-net - SANE network backend</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-net</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to image acquisition
devices through a network connection. This makes it possible to control
devices attached to a remote host and also provides a means to grant
users access to protected resources.</p>
<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>This backend expects device names of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>host</em>:<em>device</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where <em>host</em> is the name (or IP address) of the (remote) host
and <em>device</em> is the name of the device on this host that should
be addressed. If the device name does not contain a colon (:), then the
entire string is treated as the <em>device</em> string for the default
host. The default host is the host listed last in the configuration file
(see below).</p>
<p>An IPv6 address can be specified enclosed in square brackets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[::1]</em>:<em>device</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The <em>net.conf</em> file contains both backend options and a list
of host names (or IP addresses) that should be contacted for scan
requests. Anything that isn't one of the options listed below will be
treated as an host name.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>connect_timeout = nsecs</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Timeout (in seconds) for the initial connection to the
<strong>saned</strong>(8) server. This will prevent the backend from
blocking for several minutes trying to connect to an unresponsive
<strong>saned</strong>(8) host (network outage, host down, ...). The
environment variable <strong>SANE_NET_TIMEOUT</strong> can also be used
to specify the timeout at runtime.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Note
that IPv6 addresses in this file do not need to be enclosed in square
brackets. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scan-server.somedomain.firm<br />
192.168.0.1<br />
# this is a comment<br />
localhost<br />
::1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above list of hosts can be extended at run-time using environment
variable <strong>SANE_NET_HOSTS</strong>. This environment variable is a
colon-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses that should be
contacted in addition to the hosts mentioned in the configuration file.
For example, a user could set the environment variable to the
string:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>new.scanner.com:[::1]:192.168.0.2:scanner.univ.edu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To request that hosts <em>new.scanner.com</em> , <em>[::1]</em> ,
<em>192.168.0.2</em> and <em>scanner.univ.edu</em> are contacted in
addition to the hosts listed above.</p>
<p>For this backend to function properly, it is also necessary to define
the <strong>sane-port</strong> service in <em>/etc/services</em>. The
<strong>sane</strong> service should be defined using a line of the
following form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/net.conf</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The backend configuration file (see also description of
<strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-net.a</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-net.so</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in <em>/etc/sane.d</em>. If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories <em>tmp/config</em>,
<em>.</em>, and <em>/etc/sane.d</em> being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_NET_HOSTS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A colon-separated list of host names or IP addresses to be contacted
by this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_NET_TIMEOUT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of seconds to wait for a response from the
<strong>saned</strong>(8) server for the initial connection request.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_NET</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>If <strong>saned</strong>(8) has timed out, the net backend may loop
with authorization requests.</p>
