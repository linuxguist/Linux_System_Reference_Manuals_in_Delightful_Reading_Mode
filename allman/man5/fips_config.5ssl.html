<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>fips_config - OpenSSL FIPS configuration</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A separate configuration file, using the OpenSSL
<strong>config</strong> (5) syntax, is used to hold information about
the FIPS module. This includes a digest of the shared library file, and
status about the self-testing. This data is used automatically by the
module itself for two purposes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>- Run the startup FIPS self-test known answer tests (KATS).</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is normally done once, at installation time, but may also be set
up to run each time the module is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- Verify the module's checksum.</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is done each time the module is used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This file is generated by the
<strong>openssl-fipsinstall</strong> (1) program, and used internally by
the FIPS module during its initialization.</p>
<p>The following options are supported. They should all appear in a
section whose name is identified by the <strong>fips</strong> option in
the <strong>providers</strong> section, as described in Provider
Configuration Module in <strong>config</strong> (5).</p>
<dl>
<dt>activate</dt>
<dd>
<p>If present, the module is activated. The value assigned to this name
is not significant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>install-version</dt>
<dd>
<p>A version number for the fips install process. Should be 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>conditional-errors</dt>
<dd>
<p>The FIPS module normally enters an internal error mode if any self
test fails. Once this error mode is active, no services or cryptographic
algorithms are accessible from this point on. Continuous tests are a
subset of the self tests (e.g., a key pair test during key generation,
or the CRNG output test). Setting this value to <code>0</code> allows
the error mode to not be triggered if any continuous test fails. The
default value of <code>1</code> will trigger the error mode. Regardless
of the value, the operation (e.g., key generation) that called the
continuous test will return an error code if its continuous test fails.
The operation may then be retried if the error mode has not been
triggered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>security-checks</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates if run-time checks related to enforcement of security
parameters such as minimum security strength of keys and approved curve
names are used. A value of '1' will perform the checks, otherwise if the
value is '0' the checks are not performed and FIPS compliance must be
done by procedures documented in the relevant Security Policy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>module-mac</dt>
<dd>
<p>The calculated MAC of the FIPS provider file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>install-status</dt>
<dd>
<p>An indicator that the self-tests were successfully run. This should
only be written after the module has successfully passed its self tests
during installation. If this field is not present, then the self tests
will run when the module loads.</p>
</dd>
<dt>install-mac</dt>
<dd>
<p>A MAC of the value of the <strong>install-status</strong> option, to
prevent accidental changes to that value. It is written-to at the same
time as <strong>install-status</strong> is updated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>[fips_sect] activate = 1 install-version = 1 conditional-errors = 1
security-checks = 1 module-mac =
41:D0:FA:C2:5D:41:75:CD:7D:C3:90:55:6F:A4:DC install-mac =
FE:10:13:5A:D3:B4:C7:82:1B:1E:17:4C:AC:84:0C install-status =
INSTALL_SELF_TEST_KATS_RUN</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>When using the FIPS provider, it is recommended that the
<strong>config_diagnostics</strong> option is enabled to prevent
accidental use of non-FIPS validated algorithms via broken or mistaken
configuration. See <strong>config</strong> (5).</p>
