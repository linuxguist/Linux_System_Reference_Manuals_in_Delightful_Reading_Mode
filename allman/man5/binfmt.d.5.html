<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>binfmt.d - Configure additional binary formats for executables at
boot</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/binfmt.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/run/binfmt.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/usr/lib/binfmt.d/*.conf</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>At boot, <strong>systemd-binfmt.service</strong>(8) reads
configuration files from the above directories to register in the kernel
additional binary formats for executables.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FORMAT</h1>
<p>Each file contains a list of binfmt_misc kernel binary format rules.
Consult the kernels <strong>Kernel Support for miscellaneous Binary
Formats (binfmt_misc)</strong>[1] documentation file for more
information on registration of additional binary formats and how to
write rules.</p>
<p>Empty lines and lines beginning with ";" and "#" are ignored. Note
that this means you may not use those symbols as the delimiter in binary
format rules.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1>
<p>Configuration files are read from directories in /etc/, /run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and /lib/, in order of precedence, as listed in the
SYNOPSIS section above. Files must have the ".conf" extension. Files in
/etc/ override files with the same name in /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and
/lib/. Files in /run/ override files with the same name under /usr/.</p>
<p>All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in. If
multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the
lexicographically latest name will take precedence. Thus, the
configuration in a certain file may either be replaced completely (by
placing a file with the same name in a directory with higher priority),
or individual settings might be changed (by specifying additional
settings in a file with a different name that is ordered later).</p>
<p>Packages should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/
(distribution packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs). Files in
/etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic
to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. It is
recommended to prefix all filenames with a two-digit number and a dash,
to simplify the ordering of the files.</p>
<p>If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied
by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in
the configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the
vendor configuration file. If the vendor configuration file is included
in the initrd image, the image has to be regenerated.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code># Start WINE on Windows executables
:DOSWin:M::MZ::/usr/bin/wine:</code></pre>
