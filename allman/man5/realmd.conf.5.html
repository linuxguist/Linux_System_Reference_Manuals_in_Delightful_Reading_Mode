<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>realmd.conf - Tweak behavior of realmd</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILE</h1>
<p><strong>realmd</strong> can be tweaked by network administrators to
act in specific ways. This is done by placing settings in a
/etc/realmd.conf. This file does not exist by default. The syntax of
this file is the same as an INI file or Desktop Entry file. If the file
is changed and <strong>realmd</strong> is running
<strong>realmd</strong> must be restarted to read the new values.</p>
<p>In general, settings in this file only apply at the point of joining
a domain or realm. Once the realm has been setup the settings have no
effect. You may choose to configure <strong>SSSD</strong>[1] or
<strong>Winbind</strong>[2] directly.</p>
<p>Only specify the settings you wish to override in the
/etc/realmd.conf file. Settings not specified will be loaded from their
packaged defaults which can be found in
/usr/lib/realmd/realmd-defaults.conf and
/usr/lib/realmd/realmd-distro.conf. Only override the settings below.
You may find other settings if you look through the
<strong>realmd</strong> source code. However these are not guaranteed to
remain stable.</p>
<p>There are various sections in the config file. Some sections are
global topic sections, and are listed below. Other sections are specific
to a given realm. These realm specific sections should always contain
the domain name in lower case as their section header.</p>
<p>Examples of each setting is found below, including the header of the
section it should be placed in. However in the resulting file only
include each section once, and combine the various section setting
together as lines underneath the section. For example</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[users]
default-home = /home/%U
default-shell = /bin/bash</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>ACTIVE-DIRECTORY</h1>
<p>These options should go in an <strong>[active-directory]</strong>
section of the /etc/realmd.conf file. Only specify the settings you wish
to override.</p>
<p><strong>default-client</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the <strong>default-client</strong> setting in order to
control which client software is the preferred default for use with
Active Directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[active-directory]
default-client = sssd
# default-client = winbind
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The default setting for this is <strong>sssd</strong> which uses
<strong>SSSD</strong>[1] as the Active Directory client. You can also
specify <strong>winbind</strong> to use <strong>Samba
Winbind</strong>[2].</p>
<p>Some callers of <strong>realmd</strong> such as the
<strong>realm</strong> command line tool allow specifying which client
software should be used. Others, such as GNOME Control Center, simplify
choose the default.</p>
<p>You can verify the preferred default client softawre by running the
following command. The realm with the preferred client software will be
listed first.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ realm discover domain.example.com
domain.example.com
  configured: no
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: sssd
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: AD.THEWALTER.LAN
  domain-name: ad.thewalter.lan
domain.example.com
  configured: no
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: winbind
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: AD.THEWALTER.LAN
  domain-name: ad.thewalter.lan</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>use-ldaps</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the ldaps port when connecting to AD where possible. In general
this option is not needed because <strong>realmd</strong> itself only
read public information from the Active Directory domain controller
which is available anonymously. The supported membership software
products will use encrypted connections protected with GSS-SPNEGO/GSSAPI
which offers a comparable level of security than ldaps. This option is
only needed if the standard LDAP port (389/tcp) is blocked by a firewall
and only the LDAPS port (636/tcp) is available.</p>
<p>If this option is set to <em>yes</em> <strong>realmd</strong> will
use the ldaps port when reading the rootDSE and call the
<strong>adcli</strong> membership software with the option
<strong>--use-ldaps</strong>. The Samba base membership currently offers
only deprecated ways to enable ldaps. Support will be added in
<strong>realmd</strong> when a new way is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>os-name</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(see below)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>os-version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the <strong>os-name</strong> and/or
<strong>os-version</strong> settings to control the values that are
placed in the computer account <strong>operatingSystem</strong> and
<strong>operatingSystemVersion</strong> attributes.</p>
<p>This is an Active Directory specific option.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use the <strong>--os-name</strong> or
<strong>--os-version</strong> argument of the <strong>realm</strong>
command to override the default values.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[active-directory]
os-name = Gentoo Linux
os-version = 9.9.9.9.9</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h1>SERVICE</h1>
<p>These options should go in an <strong>[service]</strong> section of
the /etc/realmd.conf file. Only specify the settings you wish to
override.</p>
<p><strong>automatic-install</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set this to <em>no</em> to disable automatic installation of packages
via package-kit.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[service]
automatic-install = no
# automatic-install = yes</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>legacy-samba-config</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set this to <em>yes</em> to create a Samba configuration file with
id-mapping options used by Samba-3.5 and earlier version.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[service]
legacy-samba-config = no
# legacy-samba-config = yes</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h1>USERS</h1>
<p>These options should go in an <strong>[users]</strong> section of the
/etc/realmd.conf file. Only specify the settings you wish to
override.</p>
<p><strong>default-home</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the <strong>default-home</strong> setting in order to control
how to set the home directory for accounts that have no home directory
explicitly set.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[users]
default-home = /home/%U@%D
# default-home = /nfs/home/%D-%U
# default-home = /home/%D/%U
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The default setting for this is <strong>/home/%U@%D</strong>. The
<strong>%D</strong> format is replaced by the domain name. The
<strong>%U</strong> format is replaced by the user name.</p>
<p>You can verify the home directory for a user by running the following
command.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ getent passwd DOMAIN/User
DOMAIN\user:*:13445:13446:Name:/home/DOMAIN/user:/bin/bash</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that in the case of IPA domains, most users already have a home
directory configured in the domain. Therefore this configuration setting
may rarely show through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>default-shell</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the <strong>default-shell</strong> setting in order to
control how to set the Unix shell for accounts that have no shell
explicitly set.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[users]
default-shell = /bin/bash
# default-shell = /bin/sh
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The default setting for this is <strong>/bin/bash</strong> shell. The
shell should be a valid shell if you expect the domain users be able to
log in. For example it should exist in the /etc/shells file.</p>
<p>You can verify the shell for a user by running the following
command.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ getent passwd DOMAIN/User
DOMAIN\user:*:13445:13446:Name:/home/DOMAIN/user:/bin/bash</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that in the case of IPA domains, most users already have a shell
configured in the domain. Therefore this configuration setting may
rarely show through.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>PATHS</h1>
<p>These options should go in an <strong>[paths]</strong> section of the
/etc/realmd.conf file. Only specify the settings you wish to
override.</p>
<p><strong>krb5.conf</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Path to the Kerberos configuration file, typically /etc/krb5.conf. It
can also be the path of a file included by /etc/krb5.conf, e.g.
/etc/krb5.conf.d/realmd_settings, if the file does not exist if will be
created.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[paths]
krb5.conf = /etc/krb5.conf.d/realmd_settings
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When joining an Active Directory domain <strong>realmd</strong> will
set the <strong>default_realm</strong> and
<strong>udp_preference_limit</strong> options in the Kerberos
configuration:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>default_realm = DOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM
udp_preference_limit = 0
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>default_realm</strong> option is e.g. needed when trying
to resolve enterprise principals and makes it more convenient to request
Kerberos tickets for users of the default realm. Instead of specifying
the whole principal just <strong>kinit username</strong> can be
used.</p>
<p>With <strong>udp_preference_limit = 0</strong> always TCP will be
used to send Kerberos request to domain controller. This is useful in
Active Directory environments because Kerberos will typically switch to
TCP after initially starting with UDP because AD Kerberos tickets are
often larger than UDP can handle. Using TCP by default will avoid those
extra UDP round trips. Additionally it helps to avoid issues with
password changes when the DC does not reply soon enough and the client
will send a second UDP request. The DC might reply with a reply error to
the second request although the original password change request was
successful and the client will no know if the request was successful or
not. When using TCP this cannot happen because the client will never
send a second request but waits on the connection until the server
replies.</p>
<p>Please note that <strong>realmd</strong> will not remove those
options while leaving the domain since they are useful in general. When
joining a new domain <strong>realmd</strong> will of course overwrite
<strong>default_realm</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>REALM SPECIFIC SETTINGS</h1>
<p>These options should go in an section with the same name as the realm
in the /etc/realmd.conf file. For example for the
<strong>domain.example.com</strong> domain the section would be called
<strong>[domain.example.com]</strong>. To figure out the canonical name
for a realm use the <strong>realm</strong> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ realm discover --name-only DOMAIN.example.com
domain.example.com
...</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Only specify the settings you wish to override.</p>
<p><strong>computer-ou</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify this option to create directory computer accounts in a
location other than the default. This currently only works with Active
Directory domains.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[domain.example.com]
computer-ou = OU=Linux Computers,DC=domain,DC=example,DC=com
# computer-ou = OU=Linux Computers,
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Specify the OU as an LDAP DN. It can be relative to the Root DSE, or
a complete LDAP DN. Obviously the OU must exist in the directory.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use the <strong>--computer-ou</strong>
argument of the <strong>realm</strong> command to create a computer
account at a specific OU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>computer-name</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option only applied to Active Directory realms. Specify this
option to override the default name used when creating the computer
account. The systems FQDN will still be saved in the dNSHostName
attribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[domain.example.com]
computer-name = SERVER01</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Specify the name as a string of 15 or fewer characters that is a
valid NetBIOS computer name.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use the <strong>--computer-name</strong>
argument of the <strong>realm</strong> command to override the default
computer account name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>user-principal</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the <strong>user-principal</strong> to yes to create
<strong>userPrincipalName</strong> attribute for the computer accounts
in the realm. The exact value depends on the defaults of the used
membership software. To have full control over the value please use the
<strong>--user-principal</strong> option of the <strong>realm</strong>
command, see <strong>realm</strong>(8) for details.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[domain.example.com]
user-principal = yes</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>automatic-join</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option only applies to Active Directory realms. This option is
off by default. In Active Directory domains, a computer account can be
preset with a known computer account password. This can be used for
automatic joins without authentication.</p>
<p>When automatic joins are used there is no mutual authentication
between the machine and the domain during the join process.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[domain.example.com]
automatic-join = yes</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>automatic-id-mapping</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is on by default for Active Directory realms. Turn it off
to use UID and GID information stored in the directory (as-per RFC2307)
rather than automatically generating UID and GID numbers.</p>
<p>This option only makes sense for Active Directory realms.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[domain.example.com]
automatic-id-mapping = no
# automatic-id-mapping = yes</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>manage-system</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is on by default. Normally joining a realm affects many
aspects of the configuration and management of the system. Turning this
off limits the interaction with the realm or domain to authentication
and identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[domain.example.com]
manage-system = no
# manage-system = yes
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When this option is turned on <strong>realmd</strong> defaults to
using domain policy to control who can log into this machine. Further
adjustments to login policy can be made with the <strong>realm
permit</strong> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>fully-qualified-names</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is on by default. If turned off then realm user and group
names are not qualified their name. This may cause them to conflict with
local user and group names.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[domain.example.com]
fully-qualified-names = no
# fully-qualified-names = yes</code></pre>
</blockquote>
