<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>HTML::Element::traverse - discussion of HTML::Element's traverse
method</p>
<h1>VERSION</h1>
<p>This document describes version 5.07 of HTML::Element::traverse,
released August 31, 2017 as part of HTML-Tree.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p># $element-&gt;traverse is unnecessary and obscure. # Dont use it in
new code.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><code>HTML::Element</code> provides a method <code>traverse</code>
that traverses the tree and calls user-specified callbacks for each
node, in pre- or post-order. However, use of the method is quite
superfluous: if you want to recursively visit every node in the tree,
it's almost always simpler to write a subroutine does just that, than it
is to bundle up the pre- and/or post-order code in callbacks for the
<code>traverse</code> method.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Suppose you want to traverse at/under a node <code>$tree</code> and
give elements an 'id' attribute unless they already have one.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>traverse</code> method:</p>
<p>{ my $counter = x0000; $start_node-&gt;traverse( [ # Callbacks; #
pre-order callback: sub { my $x = $_[0]; $x-&gt;attr(id, $counter++)
unless defined $x-&gt;attr(id); return HTML::Element::OK; # keep
traversing }, # post-order callback: undef ], 1, # dont call the
callbacks for text nodes ); }</p>
<p>or you can just be simple and clear (and not have to understand the
calling format for <code>traverse</code>) by writing a sub that
traverses the tree by just calling itself:</p>
<p>{ my $counter = x0000; sub give_id { my $x = $_[0]; $x-&gt;attr(id,
$counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr(id); foreach my $c
($x-&gt;content_list) { give_id($c) if ref $c; # ignore text nodes } };
give_id($start_node); }</p>
<p>See, isn't that nice and clear?</p>
<p>But, if you really need to know:</p>
<h1>THE TRAVERSE METHOD</h1>
<p>The <code>traverse()</code> method is a general object-method for
traversing a tree or subtree and calling user-specified callbacks. It
accepts the following syntaxes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$h-&gt;traverse(\&amp;callback)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>or $h-&gt;traverse(\&amp;callback, $ignore_text)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>or $h-&gt;traverse( [\&amp;pre_callback,\&amp;post_callback] ,
$ignore_text)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>These all mean to traverse the element and all of its children. That
is, this method starts at node <code>$h</code>, pre-order visits
<code>$h</code>, traverses its children, and then will post-order visit
<code>$h</code>. Visiting means that the callback routine is called,
with these arguments:</p>
<p>$_[0] : the node (element or text segment), $_[1] : a startflag, and
$_[2] : the depth</p>
<p>If the <code>$ignore_text</code> parameter is given and true, then
the pre-order call <em>will not</em> be happen for text content.</p>
<p>The startflag is 1 when we enter a node (i.e., in pre-order calls)
and 0 when we leave the node (in post-order calls).</p>
<p>Note, however, that post-order calls don't happen for nodes that are
text segments or are elements that are prototypically empty (like br,
hr, etc.).</p>
<p>If we visit text nodes (i.e., unless <code>$ignore_text</code> is
given and true), then when text nodes are visited, we will also pass two
extra arguments to the callback:</p>
<p>$_[3] : the element thats the parent of this text node $_[4] : the
index of this text node in its parents content list</p>
<p>Note that you can specify that the pre-order routine can be a
different routine from the post-order one:</p>
<p>$h-&gt;traverse( [\&amp;pre_callback,\&amp;post_callback], ...);</p>
<p>You can also specify that no post-order calls are to be made, by
providing a false value as the post-order routine:</p>
<p>$h-&gt;traverse([ \&amp;pre_callback,0 ], ...);</p>
<p>And similarly for suppressing pre-order callbacks:</p>
<p>$h-&gt;traverse([ 0,\&amp;post_callback ], ...);</p>
<p>Note that these two syntaxes specify the same operation:</p>
<p>$h-&gt;traverse([\&amp;foo,\&amp;foo], ...); $h-&gt;traverse(
\&amp;foo , ...);</p>
<p>The return values from calls to your pre- or post-order routines are
significant, and are used to control recursion into the tree.</p>
<p>These are the values you can return, listed in descending order of my
estimation of their usefulness:</p>
<dl>
<dt>HTML::Element::OK, 1, or any other true value</dt>
<dd>
<p>...to keep on traversing. Note that <code>HTML::Element::OK</code> et
al are constants. So if you're running under <code>use strict</code> (as
I hope you are), and you say: <code>return HTML::Element::PRUEN</code>
the compiler will flag this as an error (an unallowable bareword,
specifically), whereas if you spell PRUNE correctly, the compiler will
not complain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>undef, 0, '0', '', or HTML::Element::PRUNE</dt>
<dd>
<p>...to block traversing under the current element's content. (This is
ignored if received from a post-order callback, since by then the
recursion has already happened.) If this is returned by a pre-order
callback, no post-order callback for the current node will happen.
(Recall that if your callback exits with just <code>return;</code>, it
is returning undef Î©- at least in scalar context, and
<code>traverse</code> always calls your callbacks in scalar
context.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>HTML::Element::ABORT</dt>
<dd>
<p>...to abort the whole traversal immediately. This is often useful
when you're looking for just the first node in the tree that meets some
criterion of yours.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HTML::Element::PRUNE_UP</dt>
<dd>
<p>...to abort continued traversal into this node and its parent node.
No post-order callback for the current or parent node will happen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HTML::Element::PRUNE_SOFTLY</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like PRUNE, except that the post-order call for the current node is
not blocked.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Almost every task to do with extracting information from a tree can
be expressed in terms of traverse operations (usually in only one pass,
and usually paying attention to only pre-order, or to only post-order),
or operations based on traversing. (In fact, many of the other methods
in this class are basically calls to <strong>traverse()</strong> with
particular arguments.)</p>
<p>The source code for HTML::Element and HTML::TreeBuilder contain
several examples of the use of the traverse method to gather information
about the content of trees and subtrees.</p>
<p>(Note: you should not change the structure of a tree <em>while</em>
you are traversing it.)</p>

<h2>Traversing with Recursive Anonymous Routines</h2>
<p>Now, if you've been reading <em>Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs</em> too much, maybe you even want a recursive lambda.
Go ahead:</p>
<p>{ my $counter = x0000; my $give_id; $give_id = sub { my $x = $_[0];
$x-&gt;attr(id, $counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr(id); foreach my
$c ($x-&gt;content_list) { $give_id-&gt;($c) if ref $c; # ignore text
nodes } }; $give_id-&gt;($start_node); undef $give_id; }</p>
<p>It's a bit nutty, and it's <em>still</em> more concise than a call to
the <code>traverse</code> method!</p>
<p>It is left as an exercise to the reader to figure out how to do the
same thing without using a <code>$give_id</code> symbol at all.</p>
<p>It is also left as an exercise to the reader to figure out why I
undefine <code>$give_id</code>, above; and why I could achieved the same
effect with any of:</p>
<p>$give_id = I like pie!; # or... $give_id = []; # or even; $give_id =
sub { print "Mmmm pie!\n" };</p>
<p>But not:</p>
<p>$give_id = sub { print "Im $give_id and I like pie!\n" }; # nor...
$give_id = \$give_id; # nor... $give_id = { pie =&gt; \$give_id, mode
=&gt; a la };</p>
<h2>Doing Recursive Things Iteratively</h2>
<p>Note that you may at times see an iterative implementation of
pre-order traversal, like so:</p>
<p>{ my @to_do = ($tree); # start-node while(@to_do) { my $this = shift
@to_do; # "Visit" the node: $this-&gt;attr(id, $counter++) unless
defined $this-&gt;attr(id); unshift @to_do, grep ref $_,
$this-&gt;content_list; # Put children on the stack -- theyll be visited
next } }</p>
<p>This can <em>under certain circumstances</em> be more efficient than
just a normal recursive routine, but at the cost of being rather
obscure. It gains efficiency by avoiding the overhead of
function-calling, but since there are several method dispatches however
you do it (to <code>attr</code> and <code>content_list</code>), the
overhead for a simple function call is insignificant.</p>
<h2>Pruning and Whatnot</h2>
<p>The <code>traverse</code> method does have the fairly neat features
of the <code>ABORT</code>, <code>PRUNE_UP</code> and
<code>PRUNE_SOFTLY</code> signals. None of these can be implemented
<em>totally</em> straightforwardly with recursive routines, but it is
quite possible. <code>ABORT</code>-like behavior can be implemented
either with using non-local returning with
<code>eval</code>/<code>die</code>:</p>
<p>my $died_on; # if you need to know where... sub thing { ... visits
$_[0]... ... maybe set $died_on to $_[0] and die "ABORT_TRAV" ... ...
else call thing($child) for each child... ...any post-order visiting
$_[0]... } eval { thing($node) }; if($@) { if($@ =~
m&lt;^ABORT_TRAV&gt;) { ...it died (aborted) on $died_on... } else { die
$@; # some REAL error happened } }</p>
<p>or you can just do it with flags:</p>
<p>my($abort_flag, $died_on); sub thing { ... visits $_[0]... ... maybe
set $abort_flag = 1; $died_on = $_[0]; return; foreach my $c
($_[0]-&gt;content_list) { thing($c); return if $abort_flag; } ...any
post-order visiting $_[0]... return; } $abort_flag = $died_on = undef;
thing($node); ...if defined $abort_flag, it died on $died_on</p>
