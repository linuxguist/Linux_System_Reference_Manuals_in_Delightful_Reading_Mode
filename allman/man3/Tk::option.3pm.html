<p>    <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>optionAdd</strong>(<em>pattern</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>
?,<em>priority</em>?);</p>

<p>    <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>optionGet</strong>(<em>name,
class</em>);</p>
<p>    <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>optionReadfile</strong>(<em>fileName</em>
?,<em>priority</em>?);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The option database (also known as the <em>resource database</em> or
the <em>application defaults database</em>) is a set of rules for
applying default options to widgets. Users and system administrators can
set up these rules to customize the appearance of applications without
changing any application code; for example, a user might set up personal
foreground and background colors, or a site might use fonts associated
with visual or language preferences. Different window managers (and
implementations of them) have implemented the database differently, but
most Xt-based window managers use the <em>.Xdefaults</em> file or the
<em>xrdb</em> utility to manage user preferences; some use both, and/or
implement a more complex set of site, user and application databases.
Check your site documentation for these topics or your window manager's
<strong>RESOURCE_MANAGER</strong> property.</p>
<h2>Being a good citizen</h2>
<p>For most applications, the option database just works. The
<strong>option...</strong> methods are for applications that need to do
something unusual, such as add new rules or test an option's default.
Even in such cases, the application should provide for user preferences.
Do not hardcode widget options without a <strong>very</strong> good
reason. All users have their own tastes and they are all different. They
choose a special font in a special size and have often spend a lot of
time working out a color scheme that they will love until death. When
you respect their choices they will enjoy working with your applications
much more. Don't destroy the common look and feel of a personal
desktop.</p>
<h2>Option rules and widget identification</h2>
<p>All widgets in an application are identified hierarchically by
<em>pathname</em>, starting from the <strong>MainWindow</strong> and
passing through each widget used to create the endpoint. The path
elements are <em>widget names</em>, much like the elements of a file
path from the root directory to a file. The rules in the option database
are patterns that are matched against a widget's <em>pathname</em> to
determine which defaults apply. When a widget is created, the
<strong>Name</strong> option can be used to assign the widget's name and
thus create a distinctive path for widgets in an application. If the
<strong>Name</strong> option isn't given, Perl/Tk assigns a default name
based on the type of widget; a <strong>MainWindow</strong>'s default
name is the <strong>appname</strong>. These defaults are fine for most
widgets, so don't feel you need to find a meaningful name for every
widget you create. A widget must have a distinctive name to allow users
to tailor its options independently of other widgets in an application.
For instance, to create a <strong>Text</strong> widget that will have
special options assigned to it, give it a name such as:</p>
<p>$text = $mw-&gt;Text(Name =&gt; importantText);</p>
<p>You can then tailor the widget's attributes with a rule in the option
database such as:</p>
<p>*importantText*foreground: red</p>
<p>The <em>class</em> attribute identifies groups of widgets, usually
within an application but also to group similar widgets among different
applications. One typically assigns a class to a
<strong>TopLevel</strong> or <strong>Frame</strong> so that the class
will apply to all of that widget's children. To extend the example, we
could be more specific about the importantText widget by giving its
frame a class:</p>
<p>$frame = $mw-&gt;Frame(-class =&gt; Urgent); $text =
$frame-&gt;Text(Name =&gt; importantText);</p>
<p>Then the resource pattern can be specified as so:</p>
<p>*Urgent*importantText*foreground: red</p>
<p>Similarly, the pattern <code>*Urgent*background: cyan</code> would
apply to all widgets in the frame.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;widgetClass(Name=&gt;name, -class=&gt;class);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identify a new widget with <em>name</em> and/or <em>class</em>.
<strong>Name</strong> specifies the path element for the widget; names
generally begin with a lowercase letter. <strong>-class</strong>
specifies the class for the widget and its children; classes generally
begin with an uppercase letter. If not specified, Perl/Tk will assign a
unique default name to each widget. Only <strong>MainWindow</strong>
widgets have a default class, made by uppercasing the first letter of
the application name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;PathName;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>PathName</strong> method returns the widget's
<em>pathname</em>, which uniquely identifies the widget within the
application.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;optionAdd(pattern=&gt;value ?, priority?);</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>optionAdd</strong> method adds a new option to the
database. <em>Pattern</em> contains the option being specified, and
consists of names and/or classes separated by asterisks or dots, in the
usual X format. <em>Value</em> contains a text string to associate with
<em>pattern</em>; this is the value that will be returned in calls to
the <strong>optionGet</strong> method. If <em>priority</em> is
specified, it indicates the priority level for this option (see below
for legal values); it defaults to <strong>interactive</strong>. This
method always returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;optionClear;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>optionClear</strong> method clears the option database.
Default options (from the <strong>RESOURCE_MANAGER</strong> property or
the <strong>.Xdefaults</strong> file) will be reloaded automatically the
next time an option is added to the database or removed from it. This
method always returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;optionGet(name,class);</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>optionGet</strong> method returns the value of the option
specified for <em><code>$widget</code></em> under <em>name</em> and
<em>class</em>. To look up the option, <strong>optionGet</strong>
matches the patterns in the resource database against
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s <em>pathname</em> along with the class
of <em><code>$widget</code></em> (or its parent if
<em><code>$widget</code></em> has no class specified). The widget's
class and name are options set when the widget is created (not related
to class in the sense of bless); the <strong>MainWindow</strong>'s name
is the <strong>appname</strong> and its class is (by default) derived
from the name of the script. If several entries in the option database
match <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s <em>pathname</em>, <em>name</em>,
and <em>class</em>, then the method returns whichever was created with
highest <em>priority</em> level. If there are several matching entries
at the same priority level, then it returns whichever entry was <em>most
recently entered</em> into the option database. If there are no matching
entries, then the empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;optionReadfile(fileName?,priority?);</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>optionReadfile</strong> method reads <em>fileName</em>,
which should have the standard format for an X resource database such as
<strong>.Xdefaults</strong>, and adds all the options specified in that
file to the option database. If <em>priority</em> is specified, it
indicates the priority level at which to enter the options;
<em>priority</em> defaults to <strong>interactive</strong>. The
<em>priority</em> arguments to the <strong>option</strong> methods are
normally specified symbolically using one of the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>widgetDefault</dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 20. Used for default values hard-coded into widgets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>startupFile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 40. Used for options specified in application-specific startup
files.</p>
</dd>
<dt>userDefault</dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 60. Used for options specified in user-specific defaults files,
such as <strong>.Xdefaults</strong>, resource databases loaded into the
X server, or user-specific startup files.</p>
</dd>
<dt>interactive</dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 80. Used for options specified interactively after the
application starts running. If <em>priority</em> isn't specified, it
defaults to this level.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any of the above keywords may be abbreviated. In addition, priorities
may be specified numerically using integers between 0 and 100,
inclusive. The numeric form is probably a bad idea except for new
priority levels other than the ones given above.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>The priority scheme used by core Tk is not the same as used by normal
Xlib routines. In particular is assumes that the order of the entries is
defined, but user commands like <strong>xrdb -merge</strong> can change
the order.</p>
