<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Table - Scrollable 2 dimensional table of Tk widgets</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk::Table; $table = $parent-&gt;Table(-rows =&gt; number,
-columns =&gt; number, -scrollbars =&gt; anchor, -fixedrows =&gt;
number, -fixedcolumns =&gt; number, -takefocus =&gt; boolean); $widget =
$table-&gt;Button(...); $old = $table-&gt;put($row,$col,$widget); $old =
$table-&gt;put($row,$col,"Text"); # simple Label $widget =
$table-&gt;get($row,$col); $cols = $table-&gt;totalColumns; $rows =
$table-&gt;totalRows; $table-&gt;see($widget);
$table-&gt;see($row,$col); ($row,$col) = $table-&gt;Posn($widget);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Tk::Table is an all-perl widget/geometry manager which allows a two
dimensional table of arbitrary perl/Tk widgets to be displayed.</p>
<p>Entries in the Table are simply ordinary perl/Tk widgets. They should
be created with the Table as their parent. Widgets are positioned in the
table using:</p>
<p>$table-&gt;put($row,$col,$widget)</p>
<p>If <em><code>$widget</code></em> is not a reference it is treated as
a string, and a Lable widget is created with the string as its text.</p>
<p>All the widgets in each column are set to the same width - the
requested width of the widest widget in the column. Likewise, all the
widgets in each row are set to the same height - the requested height of
the tallest widget in the column.</p>
<p>A number of rows and/or columns can be marked as 'fixed' - and so can
serve as 'headings' for the remainder the rows which are scrollable.</p>
<p>The requested size of the table as a whole is such that the number of
rows specified by -rows (default 10), and number of columns specified by
-columns (default 10) can be displayed.</p>
<p>If the Table is told it can take the keyboard focus then cursor and
scroll keys scroll the displayed widgets.</p>
<p><code>-scrollbars</code>. By default, scrollbars will be added
<code>nw</code>. To disable scrollbars, set <code>-scrollbars</code> to
an empty string:</p>
<p>$table = $parent-&gt;Table(-scrollbars =&gt; , ...);</p>
<p>The table can be emptied using</p>
<p>$table-&gt;clear</p>
<p>the widgets which were in the table are destroyed.</p>
<p>The Tk::Table widget is derived from a Tk::Frame, so inherits all its
configure options.</p>
<p>The default focus traversal is giving the focus only to the table
widget as a whole. To enable focus traversal into table cells (e.g. if
there are embedded entry widgets), then the option
<code>-takefocus</code> has to be set to <code>0</code>.</p>
<h1>BUGS / Snags / Possible enhancements</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Very large Tables consume a lot of X windows.</p></li>
<li><p>No equivalent of pack's -anchor/-pad etc. options</p></li>
</ul>
