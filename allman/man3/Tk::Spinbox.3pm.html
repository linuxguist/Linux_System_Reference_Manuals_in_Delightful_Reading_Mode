</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the Spinbox:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>disabled</strong>, or
<strong>readonly</strong>. If the Spinbox is readonly, then the value
may not be changed using methods and no insertion cursor will be
displayed, even if the input focus is in the widget; the contents of the
widget may still be selected. If the Spinbox is disabled, the value may
not be changed, no insertion cursor will be displayed, the contents will
not be selectable, and the Spinbox may be displayed in a different
color, depending on the values of the

</dd>
</dl>
<p>A floating-point value corresponding to the highest value for the
Spinbox, to be used in conjunction with <strong>-from</strong> and
<strong>-increment</strong>. When all are specified correctly, the
Spinbox will use these values to control its contents. This value must
be greater than the <strong>-from</strong> option. If
<strong>-values</strong> is specified, it supercedes this option.</p>

<dt>Class: ValidateCommand</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a script to evaluate when you want to validate the input in
the widget. Setting it to an empty string disables this feature (the
default). Validation occurs according to the value of
<strong>-validate</strong>. This command must return a valid boolean
value. If it returns 0 (or the valid boolean equivalent) then the value
of the widget will not change and the <strong>invalidCommand</strong>
will be evaluated if it is set. If it returns 1, then value will be
changed. See <strong>Validation</strong> below for more information.</p>

<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Must be a proper list value. If specified, the Spinbox will use these
values as to control its contents, starting with the first value. This
option has precedence over the <strong>-from</strong> and
<strong>-to</strong> range.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Class: Width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies an integer value indicating the desired width of the
Spinbox window, in average-size characters of the widget's font. If the
value is less than or equal to zero, the widget picks a size just large
enough to hold its current text.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Option: -wrap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Name: wrap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Class: Wrap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Must be a proper boolean value. If on, the Spinbox will wrap around
the values of data in the widget.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Spinbox</strong> method creates a new window (given by
the <code>$spinbox</code> argument) and makes it into a Spinbox widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the Spinbox such
as its colors, font, and relief.</p>
<p>A <strong>Spinbox</strong> is an extended <strong>Entry</strong>
widget that allows he user to move, or spin, through a fixed set of
ascending or descending values such as times or dates in addition to
editing the value as in an <strong>entry</strong>. When first created, a
Spinbox's string is empty. A portion of the Spinbox may be selected as
described below. If a Spinbox is exporting its selection (see the
<strong>exportSelection</strong> option), then it will observe the
standard protocols for handling the selection; Spinbox selections are
available as type <strong>STRING</strong>. Spinboxes also observe the
standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus. When a Spinbox has
the input focus it displays an <em>insertion cursor</em> to indicate
where new characters will be inserted.</p>
<p>Spinboxes are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit
entirely within the widget's window. In this case, only a portion of the
string will be displayed; commands described below may be used to change
the view in the window. Spinboxes use the standard
<strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> mechanism for interacting with
scrollbars (see the description of the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong>
option for details). They also support scanning, as described below.</p>
<h1>VALIDATION</h1>
<p>Validation works by setting the <strong>validateCommand</strong>
option to a callback which will be evaluated according to the
<strong>validate</strong> option as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>
<p>Default. This means no validation will occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focus</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the Spinbox
receives or loses focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusin</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the Spinbox
receives focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusout</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the Spinbox
loses focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>key</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the Spinbox is
edited.</p>
</dd>
<dt>all</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called for all above
conditions. The <strong>validateCommand</strong> and
<strong>invalidCommand</strong> callbacks are invoked with at least 5
positional arguments, which are <em>appended</em> to any already
existing callback arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 The proposed value of the entry. If you are configuring the
entry widget to have a new textVariable, this will be the value of that
textVariable.</p></li>
<li><p>2 The characters to be added (or deleted). This will be
<code>undef</code> if validation is due to focus, explcit call to
validate or if change is due to <code>-textvariable</code>
changing.</p></li>
<li><p>3 The current value of entry i.e. before the proposed
change.</p></li>
<li><p>4 The index of character string to be added/deleted, if any.
Otherwise -1.</p></li>
<li><p>5 Type of action. 1 == INSERT, 0 == DELETE, -1 if it's a forced
validation or textVariable validation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the <strong>textVariable</strong> and
<strong>validateCommand</strong> can be dangerous to mix. Any problems
have been overcome so that using the <strong>validateCommand</strong>
will not interfere with the traditional behavior of the Spinbox widget.
Using the <strong>textVariable</strong> for read-only purposes will
never cause problems. The danger comes when you try set the
<strong>textVariable</strong> to something that the
<strong>validateCommand</strong> would not accept, which causes
<strong>validate</strong> to become <em>none</em> (the
<strong>invalidCommand</strong> will not be triggered). The same happens
when an error occurs evaluating the <strong>validateCommand</strong>.
Primarily, an error will occur when the <strong>validateCommand</strong>
or <strong>invalidCommand</strong> encounters an error in its script
while evaluating or <strong>validateCommand</strong> does not return a
valid boolean value. The <strong>validate</strong> option will also set
itself to <strong>none</strong> when you edit the Spinbox widget from
within either the <strong>validateCommand</strong> or the
<strong>invalidCommand</strong>. Such editions will override the one
that was being validated. If you wish to edit the value of the widget
during validation and still have the <strong>validate</strong> option
set, you should include the command my $val =
$spinbox-&gt;cget(-validate); $spinbox-&gt;configure(-validate =&gt;
$val); in the <strong>validateCommand</strong> or
<strong>invalidCommand</strong> (whichever one you were editing the
Spinbox widget from). It is also recommended to not set an associated
<strong>textVariable</strong> during validation, as that can cause the
Spinbox widget to become out of sync with the
<strong>textVariable</strong>.</p>

</dl>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Spinbox</strong> command creates a widget object whose
name is <code>$widget</code>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<p>$widget-&gt;method(?arg arg ...?);</p>
<p>Many of the methods for Spinboxes take one or more indices as
arguments. An index specifies a particular character in the Spinbox's
string, in any of the following ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to
the first character in the string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>anchor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
<strong>select from</strong> and <strong>select adjust</strong>
methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt>end</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the Spinbox's
string. This is equivalent to specifying a numerical index equal to the
length of the Spinbox's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>insert</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the
insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sel.first</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the first character in the selection. It is an error to use
this form if the selection isn't in the Spinbox window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sel.last</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection. It
is an error to use this form if the selection isn't in the Spinbox
window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li><p>In this form, <em>number</em> is treated as an x-coordinate in
the Spinbox's window; the character spanning that x-coordinate is used.
For example, ``<strong><code>@0</code></strong>'' indicates the
left-most character in the window.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g.
``<strong>e</strong>'' or ``<strong>sel.f</strong>''. In general,
out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest legal
value.</p>
<p>The following commands are possible for Spinbox widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;bbox(index);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
character given by <em>index</em>. The first two elements of the list
give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen area
covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last
two elements give the width and height of the character, in pixels. The
bounding box may refer to a region outside the visible area of the
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;cget(option);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>Spinbox</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;configure(?option?, ?value, option, value, ...?);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <code>$widget</code> (see Tk::configure for
information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If
one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this
case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any
of the values accepted by the <strong>Spinbox</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;delete(first, ?last?);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delete one or more elements of the Spinbox. <em>First</em> is the
index of the first character to delete, and <em>last</em> is the index
of the character just after the last one to delete. If <em>last</em>
isn't specified it defaults to <em>first</em>+1, i.e. a single character
is deleted. This command returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;get;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the Spinbox's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;icursor(index);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the
character given by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;identify(x, y);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the window element corresponding to coordinates
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in the Spinbox. Return value is one of:
<strong>none</strong>, <strong>buttondown</strong>,
<strong>buttonup</strong>, <strong>entry</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;index(index);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the numerical index corresponding to <em>index</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;insert(index, string);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the characters of <em>string</em> just before the character
indicated by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;invoke(element);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes the specified element, either <strong>buttondown</strong> or
<strong>buttonup</strong>, to be invoked, triggering the action
associated with it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;scan(option, args);</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to implement scanning on Spinboxes. It has two
forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;scanMark(x);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Records <em>x</em> and the current view in the Spinbox window; used
in conjunction with later <strong>scan dragto</strong> commands.
Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press in the
widget. It returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;scanDragto(x);</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command computes the difference between its <em>x</em> argument
and the <em>x</em> argument to the last <strong>scan mark</strong>
command for the widget. It then adjusts the view left or right by 10
times the difference in x-coordinates. This command is typically
associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce the effect
of dragging the Spinbox at high speed through the window. The return
value is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selection(option, arg);</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to adjust the selection within a Spinbox. It has
several forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selectionAdjust(index);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character given by
<em>index</em>, and adjust that end of the selection to be at
<em>index</em> (i.e including but not going beyond <em>index</em>). The
other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future
<strong>select to</strong> commands. If the selection isn't currently in
the Spinbox, then a new selection is created to include the characters
between <em>index</em> and the most recent selection anchor point,
inclusive. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selectionClear;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget. If the
selection isn't in this widget then the command has no effect. Returns
an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selectionElement(?element?);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets or gets the currently selected element. If a spinbutton element
is specified, it will be displayed depressed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selectionFrom(index);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the selection anchor point to just before the character given by
<em>index</em>. Doesn't change the selection. Returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selectionPresent;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the Spinbox, 0 if
nothing is selected.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selectionRange(start, end);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the one
indexed by <em>start</em> and ending with the one just before
<em>end</em>. If <em>end</em> refers to the same character as
<em>start</em> or an earlier one, then the Spinbox's selection is
cleared.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;selectionTo(index);</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>index</em> is before the anchor point, set the selection to
the characters from <em>index</em> up to but not including the anchor
point. If <em>index</em> is the same as the anchor point, do nothing. If
<em>index</em> is after the anchor point, set the selection to the
characters from the anchor point up to but not including <em>index</em>.
The anchor point is determined by the most recent <strong>select
from</strong> or <strong>select adjust</strong> command in this widget.
If the selection isn't in this widget then a new selection is created
using the most recent anchor point specified for the widget. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;set(?string?);</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>string</em> is specified, the Spinbox will try and set it to
this value, otherwise it just returns the Spinbox's string. If
validation is on, it will occur when setting the string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;validate;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to force an evaluation of the
<strong>validateCommand</strong> independent of the conditions specified
by the <strong>validate</strong> option. This is done by temporarily
setting the <strong>validate</strong> option to <strong>all</strong>. It
returns 0 or 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;xview(args);</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
the text in the widget's window. It can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;xview;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal span
that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2
and the second element is .6, 20% of the Spinbox's text is off-screen to
the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text
is off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to
scrollbars via the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;xview(index);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by
<em>index</em> is displayed at the left edge of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;xviewMoveto(fraction);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character
<em>fraction</em> of the way through the text appears at the left edge
of the window. <em>Fraction</em> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;xviewScroll(number, what);</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right
by <em>number</em> average-width characters on the display; if it is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by <em>number</em>
screenfuls. If <em>number</em> is negative then characters farther to
the left become visible; if it is positive then characters farther to
the right become visible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for Spinboxes that give them
the following default behavior. In the descriptions below, ``word''
refers to a contiguous group of letters, digits, or ``_'' characters, or
any single character other than these.</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before
the character underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this
widget, and clears any selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse
button 1 strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the
character under the mouse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse
and positions the insertion cursor at the beginning of the word.
Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection consisting of
whole words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the
Spinbox and positions the insertion cursor before the first
character.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse
button 1 while the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of the
selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was
pressed. If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the
selection will be adjusted in units of whole words.</p>

the new character. Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion
cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the
insertion cursor by words and also extend the selection. Control-b and
Control-f behave the same as Left and Right, respectively. Meta-b and

cursor will be displayed and no text modifications will take place. The
behavior of Spinboxes can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
