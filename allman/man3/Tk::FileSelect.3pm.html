<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::FileSelect - a widget for choosing files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk::FileSelect; $FSref = $top-&gt;FileSelect(-directory =&gt;
$start_dir); $top - a window reference, e.g. MainWindow-&gt;new
$start_dir - the starting point for the FileSelect $file =
$FSref-&gt;Show; Executes the fileselector until either a filename is
accepted or the user hits Cancel. Returns the filename or the empty
string, respectively, and unmaps the FileSelect.
$FSref-&gt;configure(option =&gt; value[, ...]) Please see the Populate
subroutine as the configuration list changes rapidly.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This Module pops up a Fileselector box, with a directory entry on
top, a list of directories in the current directory, a list of files in
the current directory, an entry for entering/modifying a file name, an
accept button and a cancel button.</p>
<p>You can enter a starting directory in the directory entry. After
hitting Return, the listboxes get updated. Double clicking on any
directory shows you the respective contents. Single clicking on a file
brings it into the file entry for further consideration, double clocking
on a file pops down the file selector and calls the optional command
with the complete path for the selected file. Hitting return in the file
selector box or pressing the accept button will also work. *NOTE* the
file selector box will only then get destroyed if the file name is not
zero length. If you want yourself take care of it, change the
if(length(.. in sub accept_file.</p>

<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<h2>950621 Ω- The following changes were made:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Rewrote Tk stuff to take advantage of new Compound widget module,
so FileSelect is now composed of 2 LabEntry and 2 ScrlListbox2
subwidgets.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved entry labels (from to the left of) to above the entry
fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Caller is now able to control these aspects of widget, in both
FileSelect (new) and configure : (Please see subroutine Populate for
details, as these options change rapidly!)</p></li>
<li><p>I changed from Double-Button-1 to Button-1 in the Files listbox,
to work with multiple mode in addition to browse mode. I also made some
name changes (LastPath --&gt; saved_path, ...).</p></li>
<li><p>The show method is not yet updated.</p></li>
<li><p>The topLevel stuff is not done yet. I took it out while I toy
with the idea of FileSelect as a subwidget. Then the 'normal' topLevel
thing with Buttons along the bottom could be build on top of
it.</p></li>
<li><p>By request of Henry Katz &lt;katz@fs09.webo.dg.com&gt;, I added
the functionality of using the Directory entry as a filter. So, if you
want to only see the *.c files, you add a .c (the *'s already there :)
and hit return.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>95/10/17, SOL, LUCC. lusol@Lehigh.EDU</h2>
<ul>
<li><p> Allow either file or directory names to be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>Require double click to move into a new directory rather than a
single click. This allows a single click to select a directory name so
it can be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>Add -verify list option so that standard Perl file test operators
(like -d and -x) can be specified for further name validation. The
default value is the special value '!-d' (not a directory), so any name
can be selected as long as it's not a directory - after all, this IS
FileSelect! For example: $fs-&gt;configure(-verify =&gt; [-d,
[\&amp;verify_code, $P1, $P2, ... $Pn]]); ensures that the selected name
is a directory. Further, if an element of the list is an array
reference, the first element is a code reference to a subroutine and the
remaining optional elements are its parameters. The subroutine is called
like this: &amp;verify_code($cd, $leaf, $P1, $P2, ... $Pn); where
<code>$cd</code> is the current directory, <code>$leaf</code> is a
directory or file name, and <code>$P1</code> .. <code>$Pn</code> are
your optional parameters. The subroutine should return TRUE if success
or FALSE if failure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>961008 Ω- derf@ti.com :</h2>
<p>By request of Jim Stern &lt;js@world.northgrum.com&gt; and Brad Vance
&lt;bvance@ti.com&gt;, I updated the Accept and Show functions to
support selection of multiple files. I also corrected a typo in the
-verify code.</p>
