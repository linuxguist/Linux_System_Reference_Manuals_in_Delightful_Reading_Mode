<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Image - Create and manipulate images</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em><code>$image</code></em> =
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<em>type</em>(?<em>arg arg
...</em>?)</p>
<p><em><code>$image</code></em>-&gt;<em>method</em>(?<em>arg arg
...</em>?)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>image</strong> constructors and methods are used to
create, delete, and query images. It can take several different forms,
depending on the <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>The constructors require a <em><code>$widget</code></em> to invoke
them, this is used to locate a <strong>MainWindow</strong>. (This is
because the underlying Tk code registers the images in the data
structure for the <strong>MainWindow</strong>.)</p>
<p>The legal forms are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;type?(?name?,?option=&gt;value ...)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a new image and returns an object. <em>type</em> specifies
the type of the image, which must be one of the types currently defined
(e.g., <strong>Bitmap</strong>). <em>name</em> specifies the name for
the image; if it is omitted then Tk picks a name of the form
<strong>image</strong><em>x</em>, where <em>x</em> is an integer. There
may be any number of <em>option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em> pairs, which
provide configuration options for the new image. The legal set of
options is defined separately for each image type; see below for details
on the options for built-in image types. If an image already exists by
the given name then it is replaced with the new image and any instances
of that image will redisplay with the new contents.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;delete</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deletes the image <em><code>$image</code></em> and returns an empty
string. If there are instances of the image displayed in widgets, the
image won't actually be deleted until all of the instances are released.
However, the association between the instances and the image manager
will be dropped. Existing instances will retain their sizes but
redisplay as empty areas. If a deleted image is recreated (with the same
<em>name</em>) the existing instances will use the new image.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;height</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string giving the height of image <em>name</em> in
pixels.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;inuse</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the image is in use
by any widgets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;imageNames</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing all existing images for
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s <strong>MainWindow</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the type of <em><code>$image</code></em> (the value of the
<em>type</em> method when the image was created).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;imageTypes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list whose elements are all of the valid image types (i.e.,
all of the values that may be supplied for the <em>type</em> to create
an image).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;width</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string giving the width of image <em>name</em> in
pixels.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUILT-IN IMAGE TYPES</h1>
<p>The following image types are defined by Tk so they will be available
in any Tk application. Individual applications or extensions may define
additional types.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bitmap</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each pixel in the image displays a foreground color, a background
color, or nothing. See Tk::Bitmap for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pixmap</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Pixmap</strong> is slightly more general than
<strong>Bitmap</strong>, each pixel can be any available color or
transparent (rendered as background color of the widget image is
displayed in). <strong>Pixmap</strong> is best used for icons and other
simple graphics with only a few colors. <strong>Pixmap</strong> is
derived from Tix. See Tk::Pixmap for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Photo</dt>
<dd>
<p>Displays a variety of full-color images, using dithering to
approximate colors on displays with limited color capabilities. See
Tk::Photo documentation for more information.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>It's necessary to use the delete method to delete an image object and
free memory associated with it. Just using a lexical variable for
storing the image object and letting the variable to go out of scope or
setting to <code>undef</code> is not sufficient.</p>
