<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>URI::file - URI that maps to local file names</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use URI::file; $u1 = URI-&gt;new("file:/foo/bar"); $u2 =
URI-&gt;new("foo/bar", "file"); $u3 = URI::file-&gt;new($path); $u4 =
URI::file-&gt;new("c:\\windows\\", "win32"); $u1-&gt;file;
$u1-&gt;file("mac");</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <code>URI::file</code> class supports <code>URI</code> objects
belonging to the <em>file</em> URI scheme. This scheme allows us to map
the conventional file names found on various computer systems to the URI
name space, see RFC 8089
&lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8089.html&gt;.</p>
<p>If you simply want to construct <em>file</em> URI objects from URI
strings, use the normal <code>URI</code> constructor. If you want to
construct <em>file</em> URI objects from the actual file names used by
various systems, then use one of the following <code>URI::file</code>
constructors:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$u = URI::file-&gt;new( $filename, [$os] )</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maps a file name to the <em>file:</em> URI name space, creates a URI
object and returns it. The <code>$filename</code> is interpreted as
belonging to the indicated operating system ($os), which defaults to the
value of the $^O variable. The <code>$filename</code> can be either
absolute or relative, and the corresponding type of URI object for
<code>$os</code> is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$u = URI::file-&gt;new_abs( $filename, [$os] )</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as URI::file-&gt;new, but makes sure that the URI returned
represents an absolute file name. If the <code>$filename</code> argument
is relative, then the name is resolved relative to the current
directory, i.e. this constructor is really the same as:
URI::file-&gt;new($filename)-&gt;abs(URI::file-&gt;cwd);</p>
</dd>
<dt>$u = URI::file-&gt;cwd</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a <em>file</em> URI that represents the current working
directory. See Cwd.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following methods are supported for <em>file</em> URI (in
addition to the common and generic methods described in URI):</p>
<dl>
<dt>$u-&gt;file( [$os] )</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a file name. It maps from the URI name space to the file name
space of the indicated operating system. It might return
<code>undef</code> if the name can not be represented in the indicated
file system.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$u-&gt;dir( [$os] )</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some systems use a different form for names of directories than for
plain files. Use this method if you know you want to use the name for a
directory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <code>URI::file</code> module can be used to map generic file
names to names suitable for the current system. As such, it can work as
a nice replacement for the <code>File::Spec</code> module. For instance,
the following code translates the UNIX-style file name
<em>Foo/Bar.pm</em> to a name suitable for the local system:</p>
<p>$file = URI::file-&gt;new("Foo/Bar.pm", "unix")-&gt;file; die "Cant
map filename Foo/Bar.pm for $^O" unless defined $file; open(FILE, $file)
|| die "Cant open $file: $!"; # do something with FILE</p>
<h1>MAPPING NOTES</h1>
<p>Most computer systems today have hierarchically organized file
systems. Mapping the names used in these systems to the generic URI
syntax allows us to work with relative file URIs that behave as they
should when resolved using the generic algorithm for URIs (specified in
RFC 3986 &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html&gt;). Mapping a
file name to the generic URI syntax involves mapping the path separator
character to / and encoding any reserved characters that appear in the
path segments of the file name. If path segments consisting of the
strings . or .. have a different meaning than what is specified for
generic URIs, then these must be encoded as well.</p>
<p>If the file system has device, volume or drive specifications as the
root of the name space, then it makes sense to map them to the authority
field of the generic URI syntax. This makes sure that relative URIs can
not be resolved above them, i.e. generally how relative file names work
in those systems.</p>
<p>Another common use of the authority field is to encode the host on
which this file name is valid. The host name localhost is special and
generally has the same meaning as a missing or empty authority field.
This use is in conflict with using it as a device specification, but can
often be resolved for device specifications having characters not legal
in plain host names.</p>
<p>File name to URI mapping in normally not one-to-one. There are
usually many URIs that map to any given file name. For instance, an
authority of localhost maps the same as a URI with a missing or empty
authority.</p>
<p>Example 1: The Mac classic (Mac OS 9 and earlier) used : as path
separator, but not in the same way as a generic URI. :foo was a relative
name. foo:bar was an absolute name. Also, path segments could contain
the / character as well as the literal . or ... So the mapping looks
like this:</p>
<p>Mac classic URI ---------- ------------------- :foo:bar &lt;==&gt;
foo/bar : &lt;==&gt; ./ ::foo:bar &lt;==&gt; ../foo/bar ::: &lt;==&gt;
../../ foo:bar &lt;==&gt; file:/foo/bar foo:bar: &lt;==&gt;
file:/foo/bar/ .. &lt;==&gt; %2E%2E &lt;undef&gt; &lt;== / foo/ &lt;==
file:/foo%2F ./foo.txt &lt;== file:/.%2Ffoo.txt</p>
<p>Note that if you want a relative URL, you *must* begin the path with
a :. Any path that begins with [^:] is treated as absolute.</p>
<p>Example 2: The UNIX file system is easy to map, as it uses the same
path separator as URIs, has a single root, and segments of . and .. have
the same meaning. URIs that have the character \0 or / as part of any
path segment can not be turned into valid UNIX file names.</p>
<p>UNIX URI ---------- ------------------ foo/bar &lt;==&gt; foo/bar
/foo/bar &lt;==&gt; file:/foo/bar /foo/bar &lt;==
file://localhost/foo/bar file: ==&gt; ./file: &lt;undef&gt; &lt;==
file:/fo%00/bar / &lt;==&gt; file:/</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES</h1>
<p>The following configuration variables influence how the class and its
methods behave:</p>
<dl>
<dt>%URI::file::OS_CLASS</dt>
<dd>
<p>This hash maps OS identifiers to implementation classes. You might
want to add or modify this if you want to plug in your own file handler
class. Normally the keys should match the $^O values in use. If there is
no mapping then the Unix implementation is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$URI::file::DEFAULT_AUTHORITY</dt>
<dd>
<p>This determines what authority string to include in absolute file
URIs. It defaults to ". If you prefer verbose URIs you might set it to
be localhost". Setting this value to <code>undef</code> forces behaviour
compatible to URI v1.31 and earlier. In this mode host names in UNC
paths and drive letters are mapped to the authority component on
Windows, while we produce authority-less URIs on Unix.</p>
