}</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The LWP::UserAgent is a class implementing a web user agent.
LWP::UserAgent objects can be used to dispatch web requests.</p>
<p>In normal use the application creates an LWP::UserAgent object, and
then configures it with values for timeouts, proxies, name, etc. It then
creates an instance of HTTP::Request for the request that needs to be
performed. This request is then passed to one of the request method the
UserAgent, which dispatches it using the relevant protocol, and returns
a HTTP::Response object. There are convenience methods for sending the
most common request types: get in LWP::UserAgent, head in
LWP::UserAgent, post in LWP::UserAgent, put in LWP::UserAgent and delete
in LWP::UserAgent. When using these methods, the creation of the request
object is hidden as shown in the synopsis above.</p>
<p>The basic approach of the library is to use HTTP-style communication
for all protocol schemes. This means that you will construct
HTTP::Request objects and receive HTTP::Response objects even for
non-HTTP resources like <em>gopher</em> and <em>ftp</em>. In order to
achieve even more similarity to HTTP-style communications,
<em>gopher</em> menus and file directories are converted to HTML
documents.</p>
<h1>CONSTRUCTOR METHODS</h1>
<p>The following constructor methods are available:</p>
<h2>clone</h2>
<p>my $ua2 = $ua-&gt;clone;</p>
<p>Returns a copy of the LWP::UserAgent object.</p>
<p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: Please be aware that the clone method does
not copy or clone your <code>cookie_jar</code> attribute. Due to the
limited restrictions on what can be used for your cookie jar, there is
no way to clone the attribute. The <code>cookie_jar</code> attribute
will be <code>undef</code> in the new object instance.</p>
<h2>new</h2>
<p>my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( %options )</p>
<p>This method constructs a new LWP::UserAgent object and returns it.
Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the initial state.
The following options correspond to attribute methods described
below:</p>
<p>KEY DEFAULT ----------- -------------------- agent
"libwww-perl/#.###" conn_cache undef cookie_jar undef default_headers
HTTP::Headers-&gt;new from undef local_address undef max_redirect 7
max_size undef no_proxy [] parse_head 1 protocols_allowed undef
protocols_forbidden undef proxy undef requests_redirectable [GET, HEAD]
ssl_opts { verify_hostname =&gt; 1 } timeout 180</p>
<p>The following additional options are also accepted: If the
<code>env_proxy</code> option is passed in with a true value, then proxy
settings are read from environment variables (see env_proxy in
LWP::UserAgent). If <code>env_proxy</code> isn't provided, the
<code>PERL_LWP_ENV_PROXY</code> environment variable controls if
env_proxy in LWP::UserAgent is called during initialization. If the
<code>keep_alive</code> option value is defined and non-zero, then an
<code>LWP::ConnCache</code> is set up (see conn_cache in
LWP::UserAgent). The <code>keep_alive</code> value is passed on as the
<code>total_capacity</code> for the connection cache.</p>
<p><code>proxy</code> must be set as an arrayref of key/value pairs.
<code>no_proxy</code> takes an arrayref of domains.</p>
<h1>ATTRIBUTES</h1>
<p>The settings of the configuration attributes modify the behaviour of
the LWP::UserAgent when it dispatches requests. Most of these can also
be initialized by options passed to the constructor method.</p>
<p>The following attribute methods are provided. The attribute value is
left unchanged if no argument is given. The return value from each
method is the old attribute value.</p>
<h2>agent</h2>
<p>my $agent = $ua-&gt;agent; $ua-&gt;agent(Checkbot/0.4 ); # append the
default to the end $ua-&gt;agent(Mozilla/5.0); $ua-&gt;agent(""); # dont
identify</p>
<p>Get/set the product token that is used to identify the user agent on
the network. The agent value is sent as the <code>User-Agent</code>
header in the requests.</p>
<p>The default is a string of the form <code>libwww-perl/#.###</code>,
where <code>#.###</code> is substituted with the version number of this
library.</p>
<p>If the provided string ends with space, the default
<code>libwww-perl/#.###</code> string is appended to it.</p>
<p>The user agent string should be one or more simple product
identifiers with an optional version number separated by the
<code>/</code> character.</p>
<h2>conn_cache</h2>
<p>my $cache_obj = $ua-&gt;conn_cache; $ua-&gt;conn_cache( $cache_obj
);</p>
<p>Get/set the LWP::ConnCache object to use. See LWP::ConnCache for
details.</p>
<h2>cookie_jar</h2>
<p>my $jar = $ua-&gt;cookie_jar; $ua-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar_obj
);</p>
<p>Get/set the cookie jar object to use. The only requirement is that
the cookie jar object must implement the
<code>extract_cookies($response)</code> and
<code>add_cookie_header($request)</code> methods. These methods will
then be invoked by the user agent as requests are sent and responses are
received. Normally this will be a HTTP::Cookies object or some subclass.
You are, however, encouraged to use HTTP::CookieJar::LWP instead. See
BEST PRACTICES for more information.</p>
<p>use HTTP::CookieJar::LWP (); my $jar = HTTP::CookieJar::LWP-&gt;new;
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( cookie_jar =&gt; $jar ); # or after
object creation $ua-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );</p>
<p>The default is to have no cookie jar, i.e. never automatically add
<code>Cookie</code> headers to the requests.</p>
<p>Shortcut: If a reference to a plain hash is passed in, it is replaced
with an instance of HTTP::Cookies that is initialized based on the hash.
This form also automatically loads the HTTP::Cookies module. It means
that:</p>
<p>$ua-&gt;cookie_jar({ file =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/.cookies.txt" });</p>
<p>is really just a shortcut for:</p>
<p>require HTTP::Cookies; $ua-&gt;cookie_jar(HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new(file
=&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/.cookies.txt"));</p>
<h2>credentials</h2>
<p>my $creds = $ua-&gt;credentials(); $ua-&gt;credentials( $netloc,
$realm ); $ua-&gt;credentials( $netloc, $realm, $uname, $pass );
$ua-&gt;credentials("www.example.com:80", "Some Realm", "foo",
"secret");</p>
<p>Get/set the user name and password to be used for a realm.</p>
<p>The <code>$netloc</code> is a string of the form
<code>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>. The username and password will
only be passed to this server.</p>
<h2>default_header</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;default_header( $field ); $ua-&gt;default_header( $field
=&gt; $value ); $ua-&gt;default_header(Accept-Encoding =&gt; scalar
HTTP::Message::decodable()); $ua-&gt;default_header(Accept-Language
=&gt; "no, en");</p>
<p>This is just a shortcut for
<code>$ua-&gt;default_headers-&gt;header( $field =&gt; $value )</code>.</p>
<h2>default_headers</h2>
<p>my $headers = $ua-&gt;default_headers; $ua-&gt;default_headers(
$headers_obj );</p>
<p>Get/set the headers object that will provide default header values
for any requests sent. By default this will be an empty HTTP::Headers
object.</p>
<h2>from</h2>
<p>my $from = $ua-&gt;from; $ua-&gt;from(foo@bar.com);</p>
<p>Get/set the email address for the human user who controls the
requesting user agent. The address should be machine-usable, as defined
in RFC2822 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822&gt;. The
<code>from</code> value is sent as the <code>From</code> header in the
requests.</p>
<p>The default is to not send a <code>From</code> header. See
default_headers in LWP::UserAgent for the more general interface that
allow any header to be defaulted.</p>
<h2>local_address</h2>
<p>my $address = $ua-&gt;local_address; $ua-&gt;local_address( $address
);</p>
<p>Get/set the local interface to bind to for network connections. The
interface can be specified as a hostname or an IP address. This value is
passed as the <code>LocalAddr</code> argument to IO::Socket::INET.</p>
<h2>max_redirect</h2>
<p>my $max = $ua-&gt;max_redirect; $ua-&gt;max_redirect( $n );</p>
<p>This reads or sets the object's limit of how many times it will obey
redirection responses in a given request cycle.</p>
<p>By default, the value is <code>7</code>. This means that if you call
request in LWP::UserAgent and the response is a redirect elsewhere which
is in turn a redirect, and so on seven times, then LWP gives up after
that seventh request.</p>
<h2>max_size</h2>
<p>my $size = $ua-&gt;max_size; $ua-&gt;max_size( $bytes );</p>
<p>Get/set the size limit for response content. The default is
<code>undef</code>, which means that there is no limit. If the returned
response content is only partial, because the size limit was exceeded,
then a <code>Client-Aborted</code> header will be added to the response.
The content might end up longer than <code>max_size</code> as we abort
once appending a chunk of data makes the length exceed the limit. The
<code>Content-Length</code> header, if present, will indicate the length
of the full content and will normally not be the same as
<code>length($res-&gt;content)</code>.</p>
<h2>parse_head</h2>
<p>my $bool = $ua-&gt;parse_head; $ua-&gt;parse_head( $boolean );</p>
<p>Get/set a value indicating whether we should initialize response
headers from the &lt;head&gt; section of HTML documents. The default is
true. <em>Do not turn this off</em> unless you know what you are
doing.</p>
<h2>protocols_allowed</h2>
<p>my $aref = $ua-&gt;protocols_allowed; # get allowed protocols
$ua-&gt;protocols_allowed( \@protocols ); # allow ONLY these
$ua-&gt;protocols_allowed(undef); # delete the list
$ua-&gt;protocols_allowed([http,]); # ONLY allow http</p>
<p>By default, an object has neither a <code>protocols_allowed</code>
list, nor a protocols_forbidden in LWP::UserAgent list.</p>
<p>This reads (or sets) this user agent's list of protocols that the
request methods will exclusively allow. The protocol names are case
insensitive.</p>
<p>For example:
<code>$ua-&gt;protocols_allowed( [ http, https] );</code> means that
this user agent will <em>allow only</em> those protocols, and attempts
to use this user agent to access URLs with any other schemes (like
<code>ftp://...</code>) will result in a 500 error.</p>
<p>Note that having a <code>protocols_allowed</code> list causes any
protocols_forbidden in LWP::UserAgent list to be ignored.</p>
<h2>protocols_forbidden</h2>
<p>my $aref = $ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden; # get the forbidden list
$ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden(\@protocols); # do not allow these
$ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden([http,]); # All http reqs get a 500
$ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden(undef); # delete the list</p>
<p>This reads (or sets) this user agent's list of protocols that the
request method will <em>not</em> allow. The protocol names are case
insensitive.</p>
<p>For example:
<code>$ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden( [ file, mailto] );</code> means that
this user agent will <em>not</em> allow those protocols, and attempts to
use this user agent to access URLs with those schemes will result in a
500 error.</p>
<h2>requests_redirectable</h2>
<p>my $aref = $ua-&gt;requests_redirectable;
$ua-&gt;requests_redirectable( \@requests );
$ua-&gt;requests_redirectable([GET, HEAD,]); # the default</p>
<p>This reads or sets the object's list of request names that
redirect_ok in LWP::UserAgent will allow redirection for. By default,
this is <code>[GET, HEAD]</code>, as per RFC 2616
&lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&gt;. To change to include
<code>POST</code>, consider:</p>
<p>push @{ $ua-&gt;requests_redirectable }, POST;</p>
<h2>send_te</h2>
<p>my $bool = $ua-&gt;send_te; $ua-&gt;send_te( $boolean );</p>
<p>If true, will send a <code>TE</code> header along with the request.
The default is true. Set it to false to disable the <code>TE</code>
header for systems who can't handle it.</p>
<h2>show_progress</h2>
<p>my $bool = $ua-&gt;show_progress; $ua-&gt;show_progress( $boolean
);</p>
<p>Get/set a value indicating whether a progress bar should be displayed
on the terminal as requests are processed. The default is false.</p>
<h2>ssl_opts</h2>
<p>my @keys = $ua-&gt;ssl_opts; my $val = $ua-&gt;ssl_opts( $key );
$ua-&gt;ssl_opts( $key =&gt; $value );</p>
<p>Get/set the options for SSL connections. Without argument return the
list of options keys currently set. With a single argument return the
current value for the given option. With 2 arguments set the option
value and return the old. Setting an option to the value
<code>undef</code> removes this option.</p>
<p>The options that LWP relates to are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>"verify_hostname" =&gt; $bool</dt>
<dd>
<p>When TRUE LWP will for secure protocol schemes ensure it connects to
servers that have a valid certificate matching the expected hostname. If
FALSE no checks are made and you can't be sure that you communicate with
the expected peer. The no checks behaviour was the default for
libwww-perl-5.837 and earlier releases. This option is initialized from
the <code>PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME</code> environment variable. If
this environment variable isn't set; then <code>verify_hostname</code>
defaults to 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"SSL_ca_file" =&gt; $path</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to a file containing Certificate Authority certificates. A
default setting for this option is provided by checking the environment
variables <code>PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_FILE</code> and
<code>HTTPS_CA_FILE</code> in order.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"SSL_ca_path" =&gt; $path</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to a directory containing files containing Certificate
Authority certificates. A default setting for this option is provided by
checking the environment variables <code>PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_PATH</code> and
<code>HTTPS_CA_DIR</code> in order.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other options can be set and are processed directly by the SSL Socket
implementation in use. See IO::Socket::SSL or Net::SSL for details.</p>
<p>The libwww-perl core no longer bundles protocol plugins for SSL. You
will need to install LWP::Protocol::https separately to enable support
for processing https-URLs.</p>
<h2>timeout</h2>
<p>my $secs = $ua-&gt;timeout; $ua-&gt;timeout( $secs );</p>
<p>Get/set the timeout value in seconds. The default value is 180
seconds, i.e. 3 minutes.</p>
<p>The request is aborted if no activity on the connection to the server
is observed for <code>timeout</code> seconds. This means that the time
it takes for the complete transaction and the request in LWP::UserAgent
method to actually return might be longer.</p>
<p>When a request times out, a response object is still returned. The
response will have a standard HTTP Status Code (500). This response will
have the Client-Warning header set to the value of Internal response.
See the get in LWP::UserAgent method description below for further
details.</p>
<h1>PROXY ATTRIBUTES</h1>
<p>The following methods set up when requests should be passed via a
proxy server.</p>
<h2>env_proxy</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;env_proxy;</p>
<p>Load proxy settings from <code>*_proxy</code> environment variables.
You might specify proxies like this (sh-syntax):</p>
<p>gopher_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/ wais_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/
no_proxy="localhost,example.com" export gopher_proxy wais_proxy
no_proxy</p>
<p>csh or tcsh users should use the <code>setenv</code> command to
define these environment variables.</p>
<p>On systems with case insensitive environment variables there exists a
name clash between the CGI environment variables and the
<code>HTTP_PROXY</code> environment variable normally picked up by
<code>env_proxy</code>. Because of this <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> is not
honored for CGI scripts. The <code>CGI_HTTP_PROXY</code> environment
variable can be used instead.</p>
<h2>no_proxy</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;no_proxy( @domains ); $ua-&gt;no_proxy(localhost,
example.com); $ua-&gt;no_proxy(); # clear the list</p>
<p>Do not proxy requests to the given domains. Calling
<code>no_proxy</code> without any domains clears the list of
domains.</p>
<h2>proxy</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;proxy(\@schemes, $proxy_url) $ua-&gt;proxy([http, ftp],
http://proxy.sn.no:8001/); # For a single scheme: $ua-&gt;proxy($scheme,
$proxy_url) $ua-&gt;proxy(gopher, http://proxy.sn.no:8001/); # To set
multiple proxies at once: $ua-&gt;proxy([ ftp =&gt;
http://ftp.example.com:8001/, [ http, https ] =&gt;
http://http.example.com:8001/, ]);</p>
<p>Set/retrieve proxy URL for a scheme.</p>
<p>The first form specifies that the URL is to be used as a proxy for
access methods listed in the list in the first method argument, i.e.
<code>http</code> and <code>ftp</code>.</p>
<p>The second form shows a shorthand form for specifying proxy URL for a
single access scheme.</p>
<p>The third form demonstrates setting multiple proxies at once. This is
also the only form accepted by the constructor.</p>
<h1>HANDLERS</h1>
<p>Handlers are code that injected at various phases during the
processing of requests. The following methods are provided to manage the
active handlers:</p>
<h2>add_handler</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;add_handler( $phase =&gt; \&amp;cb, %matchspec )</p>
<p>Add handler to be invoked in the given processing phase. For how to
specify <code>%matchspec</code> see Matching in HTTP::Config.</p>
<p>The possible values <code>$phase</code> and the corresponding
callback signatures are as follows. Note that the handlers are
documented in the order in which they will be run, which is:</p>
<p>request_preprepare request_prepare request_send response_header
response_data response_done response_redirect</p>
<dl>
<dt>request_preprepare =&gt; sub { my($request, $ua, $handler) = @_; ...
}</dt>
<dd>
<p>The handler is called before the <code>request_prepare</code> and
other standard initialization of the request. This can be used to set up
headers and attributes that the <code>request_prepare</code> handler
depends on. Proxy initialization should take place here; but in general
don't register handlers for this phase.</p>
</dd>
<dt>request_prepare =&gt; sub { my($request, $ua, $handler) = @_; ...
}</dt>
<dd>
<p>The handler is called before the request is sent and can modify the
request any way it see fit. This can for instance be used to add certain
headers to specific requests. The method can assign a new request object
to <code>$_[0]</code> to replace the request that is sent fully. The
return value from the callback is ignored. If an exception is raised it
will abort the request and make the request method return a 400 Bad
request response.</p>
</dd>
<dt>request_send =&gt; sub { my($request, $ua, $handler) = @_; ...
}</dt>
<dd>
<p>This handler gets a chance of handling requests before they're sent
to the protocol handlers. It should return an HTTP::Response object if
it wishes to terminate the processing; otherwise it should return
nothing. The <code>response_header</code> and <code>response_data</code>
handlers will not be invoked for this response, but the
<code>response_done</code> will be.</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_header =&gt; sub { my($response, $ua, $handler) = @_; ...
}</dt>
<dd>
<p>This handler is called right after the response headers have been
received, but before any content data. The handler might set up handlers
for data and might croak to abort the request. The handler might set the
<code>$response-&gt;{default_add_content}</code> value to control if any
received data should be added to the response object directly. This will
initially be false if the <code>$ua-&gt;request()</code> method was
called with a <code>$content_file</code> or
<code>$content_cb argument</code>; otherwise true.</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_data =&gt; sub { my($response, $ua, $handler, $data) = @_;
... }</dt>
<dd>
<p>This handler is called for each chunk of data received for the
response. The handler might croak to abort the request. This handler
needs to return a TRUE value to be called again for subsequent chunks
for the same request.</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_done =&gt; sub { my($response, $ua, $handler) = @_; ...
}</dt>
<dd>
<p>The handler is called after the response has been fully received, but
before any redirect handling is attempted. The handler can be used to
extract information or modify the response.</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_redirect =&gt; sub { my($response, $ua, $handler) = @_; ...
}</dt>
<dd>
<p>The handler is called in <code>$ua-&gt;request</code> after
<code>response_done</code>. If the handler returns an HTTP::Request
object we'll start over with processing this request instead.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For all of these, <code>$handler</code> is a code reference to the
handler that is currently being run.</p>
<h2>get_my_handler</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;get_my_handler( $phase, %matchspec ); $ua-&gt;get_my_handler(
$phase, %matchspec, $init );</p>
<p>Will retrieve the matching handler as hash ref.</p>
<p>If <code>$init</code> is passed as a true value, create and add the
handler if it's not found. If <code>$init</code> is a subroutine
reference, then it's called with the created handler hash as argument.
This sub might populate the hash with extra fields; especially the
callback. If <code>$init</code> is a hash reference, merge the
hashes.</p>
<h2>handlers</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;handlers( $phase, $request ) $ua-&gt;handlers( $phase,
$response )</p>
<p>Returns the handlers that apply to the given request or response at
the given processing phase.</p>
<h2>remove_handler</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;remove_handler( undef, %matchspec ); $ua-&gt;remove_handler(
$phase, %matchspec ); $ua-&gt;remove_handler(); # REMOVE ALL HANDLERS IN
ALL PHASES</p>
<p>Remove handlers that match the given <code>%matchspec</code>. If
<code>$phase</code> is not provided, remove handlers from all
phases.</p>
<p>Be careful as calling this function with <code>%matchspec</code> that
is not specific enough can remove handlers not owned by you. It's
probably better to use the set_my_handler in LWP::UserAgent method
instead.</p>
<p>The removed handlers are returned.</p>
<h2>set_my_handler</h2>
<p>$ua-&gt;set_my_handler( $phase, $cb, %matchspec );
$ua-&gt;set_my_handler($phase, undef); # remove handler for phase</p>
<p>Set handlers private to the executing subroutine. Works by defaulting
an <code>owner</code> field to the <code>%matchspec</code> that holds
the name of the called subroutine. You might pass an explicit
<code>owner</code> to override this.</p>
<p>If <code>$cb</code> is passed as <code>undef</code>, remove the
handler.</p>
<h1>REQUEST METHODS</h1>
<p>The methods described in this section are used to dispatch requests
via the user agent. The following request methods are provided:</p>
<h2>delete</h2>
<p>my $res = $ua-&gt;delete( $url ); my $res = $ua-&gt;delete( $url,
$field_name =&gt; $value, ... );</p>
<p>This method will dispatch a <code>DELETE</code> request on the given
URL. Additional headers and content options are the same as for the get
in LWP::UserAgent method.</p>
<p>This method will use the <code>DELETE()</code> function from
HTTP::Request::Common to build the request. See HTTP::Request::Common
for a details on how to pass form content and other advanced
features.</p>
<h2>get</h2>
<p>my $res = $ua-&gt;get( $url ); my $res = $ua-&gt;get( $url ,
$field_name =&gt; $value, ... );</p>
<p>This method will dispatch a <code>GET</code> request on the given
URL. Further arguments can be given to initialize the headers of the
request. These are given as separate name/value pairs. The return value
is a response object. See HTTP::Response for a description of the
interface it provides.</p>
<p>There will still be a response object returned when LWP can't connect
to the server specified in the URL or when other failures in protocol
handlers occur. These internal responses use the standard HTTP status
codes, so the responses can't be differentiated by testing the response
status code alone. Error responses that LWP generates internally will
have the Client-Warning header set to the value Internal response. If
you need to differentiate these internal responses from responses that a
remote server actually generates, you need to test this header
value.</p>
<p>Fields names that start with : are special. These will not initialize
headers of the request but will determine how the response content is
treated. The following special field names are recognized:</p>
<p>:content_file =&gt; $filename # or $filehandle :content_cb =&gt;
\&amp;callback :read_size_hint =&gt; $bytes</p>
<p>If a <code>$filename</code> or <code>$filehandle</code> is provided
with the <code>:content_file</code> option, then the response content
will be saved here instead of in the response object. The
<code>$filehandle</code> may also be an object with an open file
descriptor, such as a File::Temp object. If a callback is provided with
the <code>:content_cb</code> option then this function will be called
for each chunk of the response content as it is received from the
server. If neither of these options are given, then the response content
will accumulate in the response object itself. This might not be
suitable for very large response bodies. Only one of
<code>:content_file</code> or <code>:content_cb</code> can be specified.
The content of unsuccessful responses will always accumulate in the
response object itself, regardless of the <code>:content_file</code> or
<code>:content_cb</code> options passed in. Note that errors writing to
the content file (for example due to permission denied or the filesystem
being full) will be reported via the <code>Client-Aborted</code> or
<code>X-Died</code> response headers, and not the
<code>is_success</code> method.</p>
<p>The <code>:read_size_hint</code> option is passed to the protocol
module which will try to read data from the server in chunks of this
size. A smaller value for the <code>:read_size_hint</code> will result
in a higher number of callback invocations.</p>
<p>The callback function is called with 3 arguments: a chunk of data, a
reference to the response object, and a reference to the protocol
object. The callback can abort the request by invoking
<code>die()</code>. The exception message will show up as the X-Died
header field in the response returned by the <code>$ua-&gt;get()</code>
method.</p>
<h2>head</h2>
<p>my $res = $ua-&gt;head( $url ); my $res = $ua-&gt;head( $url ,
$field_name =&gt; $value, ... );</p>
<p>This method will dispatch a <code>HEAD</code> request on the given
URL. Otherwise it works like the get in LWP::UserAgent method described
above.</p>
<h2>is_protocol_supported</h2>
<p>my $bool = $ua-&gt;is_protocol_supported( $scheme );</p>
<p>You can use this method to test whether this user agent object
supports the specified <code>scheme</code>. (The <code>scheme</code>
might be a string (like <code>http</code> or <code>ftp</code>) or it
might be an URI object reference.)</p>
<p>Whether a scheme is supported is determined by the user agent's
<code>protocols_allowed</code> or <code>protocols_forbidden</code> lists
(if any), and by the capabilities of LWP. I.e., this will return true
only if LWP supports this protocol <em>and</em> it's permitted for this
particular object.</p>
<h2>is_online</h2>
<p>my $bool = $ua-&gt;is_online;</p>
<p>Tries to determine if you have access to the Internet. Returns
<code>1</code> (true) if the built-in heuristics determine that the user
agent is able to access the Internet (over HTTP) or <code>0</code>
(false).</p>
<p>See also LWP::Online.</p>
<h2>mirror</h2>
<p>my $res = $ua-&gt;mirror( $url, $filename );</p>
<p>This method will get the document identified by URL and store it in
file called <code>$filename</code>. If the file already exists, then the
request will contain an <code>If-Modified-Since</code> header matching
the modification time of the file. If the document on the server has not
changed since this time, then nothing happens. If the document has been
updated, it will be downloaded again. The modification time of the file
will be forced to match that of the server.</p>
<p>Uses move in File::Copy to attempt to atomically replace the
<code>$filename</code>.</p>
<p>The return value is an HTTP::Response object.</p>
<h2>patch</h2>
<p># Any version of HTTP::Message works with this form: my $res =
$ua-&gt;patch( $url, $field_name =&gt; $value, Content =&gt; $content );
# Using hash or array references requires HTTP::Message &gt;= 6.12 use
HTTP::Request 6.12; my $res = $ua-&gt;patch( $url, \%form ); my $res =
$ua-&gt;patch( $url, \@form ); my $res = $ua-&gt;patch( $url, \%form,
$field_name =&gt; $value, ... ); my $res = $ua-&gt;patch( $url,
$field_name =&gt; $value, Content =&gt; \%form ); my $res =
$ua-&gt;patch( $url, $field_name =&gt; $value, Content =&gt; \@form
);</p>
<p>This method will dispatch a <code>PATCH</code> request on the given
URL, with <code>%form</code> or <code>@form</code> providing the
key/value pairs for the fill-in form content. Additional headers and
content options are the same as for the get in LWP::UserAgent
method.</p>
<p>CAVEAT:</p>
<p>This method can only accept content that is in key-value pairs when
using HTTP::Request::Common prior to version <code>6.12</code>. Any use
of hash or array references will result in an error prior to version
<code>6.12</code>.</p>
<p>This method will use the <code>PATCH</code> function from
HTTP::Request::Common to build the request. See HTTP::Request::Common
for a details on how to pass form content and other advanced
features.</p>
<h2>post</h2>
<p>my $res = $ua-&gt;post( $url, \%form ); my $res = $ua-&gt;post( $url,
\@form ); my $res = $ua-&gt;post( $url, \%form, $field_name =&gt;
$value, ... ); my $res = $ua-&gt;post( $url, $field_name =&gt; $value,
Content =&gt; \%form ); my $res = $ua-&gt;post( $url, $field_name =&gt;
$value, Content =&gt; \@form ); my $res = $ua-&gt;post( $url,
$field_name =&gt; $value, Content =&gt; $content );</p>
<p>This method will dispatch a <code>POST</code> request on the given
URL, with <code>%form</code> or <code>@form</code> providing the
key/value pairs for the fill-in form content. Additional headers and
content options are the same as for the get in LWP::UserAgent
method.</p>
<p>This method will use the <code>POST</code> function from
HTTP::Request::Common to build the request. See HTTP::Request::Common
for a details on how to pass form content and other advanced
features.</p>
<h2>put</h2>
<p># Any version of HTTP::Message works with this form: my $res =
$ua-&gt;put( $url, $field_name =&gt; $value, Content =&gt; $content ); #
Using hash or array references requires HTTP::Message &gt;= 6.07 use
HTTP::Request 6.07; my $res = $ua-&gt;put( $url, \%form ); my $res =
$ua-&gt;put( $url, \@form ); my $res = $ua-&gt;put( $url, \%form,
$field_name =&gt; $value, ... ); my $res = $ua-&gt;put( $url,
$field_name =&gt; $value, Content =&gt; \%form ); my $res = $ua-&gt;put(
$url, $field_name =&gt; $value, Content =&gt; \@form );</p>
<p>This method will dispatch a <code>PUT</code> request on the given
URL, with <code>%form</code> or <code>@form</code> providing the
key/value pairs for the fill-in form content. Additional headers and
content options are the same as for the get in LWP::UserAgent
method.</p>
<p>CAVEAT:</p>
<p>This method can only accept content that is in key-value pairs when
using HTTP::Request::Common prior to version <code>6.07</code>. Any use
of hash or array references will result in an error prior to version
<code>6.07</code>.</p>
<p>This method will use the <code>PUT</code> function from
HTTP::Request::Common to build the request. See HTTP::Request::Common
for a details on how to pass form content and other advanced
features.</p>
<h2>request</h2>
<p>my $res = $ua-&gt;request( $request ); my $res = $ua-&gt;request(
$request, $content_file ); my $res = $ua-&gt;request( $request,
$content_cb ); my $res = $ua-&gt;request( $request, $content_cb,
$read_size_hint );</p>
<p>This method will dispatch the given <code>$request</code> object.
Normally this will be an instance of the HTTP::Request class, but any
object with a similar interface will do. The return value is an
HTTP::Response object.</p>
<p>The <code>request</code> method will process redirects and
authentication responses transparently. This means that it may actually
send several simple requests via the simple_request in LWP::UserAgent
method described below.</p>
<p>The request methods described above; get in LWP::UserAgent, head in
LWP::UserAgent, post in LWP::UserAgent and mirror in LWP::UserAgent will
all dispatch the request they build via this method. They are
convenience methods that simply hide the creation of the request object
for you.</p>
<p>The <code>$content_file</code>, <code>$content_cb</code> and
<code>$read_size_hint</code> all correspond to options described with
the get in LWP::UserAgent method above. Note that errors writing to the
content file (for example due to permission denied or the filesystem
being full) will be reported via the <code>Client-Aborted</code> or
<code>X-Died</code> response headers, and not the
<code>is_success</code> method.</p>
<p>You are allowed to use a CODE reference as <code>content</code> in
the request object passed in. The <code>content</code> function should
return the content when called. The content can be returned in chunks.
The content function will be invoked repeatedly until it return an empty
string to signal that there is no more content.</p>
<h2>simple_request</h2>
<p>my $request = HTTP::Request-&gt;new( ... ); my $res =
$ua-&gt;simple_request( $request ); my $res = $ua-&gt;simple_request(
$request, $content_file ); my $res = $ua-&gt;simple_request( $request,
$content_cb ); my $res = $ua-&gt;simple_request( $request, $content_cb,
$read_size_hint );</p>
<p>This method dispatches a single request and returns the response
received. Arguments are the same as for the request in LWP::UserAgent
described above.</p>
<p>The difference from request in LWP::UserAgent is that
<code>simple_request</code> will not try to handle redirects or
authentication responses. The request in LWP::UserAgent method will, in
fact, invoke this method for each simple request it sends.</p>
<h1>CALLBACK METHODS</h1>
<p>The following methods will be invoked as requests are processed.
These methods are documented here because subclasses of LWP::UserAgent
might want to override their behaviour.</p>
<h2>get_basic_credentials</h2>
<p># This checks wantarray and can either return an array: my ($user,
$pass) = $ua-&gt;get_basic_credentials( $realm, $uri, $isproxy ); # or a
string that looks like "user:pass" my $creds =
$ua-&gt;get_basic_credentials($realm, $uri, $isproxy);</p>
<p>This is called by request in LWP::UserAgent to retrieve credentials
for documents protected by Basic or Digest Authentication. The arguments
passed in is the <code>$realm</code> provided by the server, the
<code>$uri</code> requested and a <code>boolean flag</code> to indicate
if this is authentication against a proxy server.</p>
<p>The method should return a username and password. It should return an
empty list to abort the authentication resolution attempt. Subclasses
can override this method to prompt the user for the information. An
example of this can be found in <code>lwp-request</code> program
distributed with this library.</p>
<p>The base implementation simply checks a set of pre-stored member
variables, set up with the credentials in LWP::UserAgent method.</p>
<h2>prepare_request</h2>
<p>$request = $ua-&gt;prepare_request( $request );</p>
<p>This method is invoked by simple_request in LWP::UserAgent. Its task
is to modify the given <code>$request</code> object by setting up
various headers based on the attributes of the user agent. The return
value should normally be the <code>$request</code> object passed in. If
a different request object is returned it will be the one actually
processed.</p>
<p>The headers affected by the base implementation are;
<code>User-Agent</code>, <code>From</code>, <code>Range</code> and
<code>Cookie</code>.</p>
<h2>progress</h2>
<p>my $prog = $ua-&gt;progress( $status, $request_or_response );</p>
<p>This is called frequently as the response is received regardless of
how the content is processed. The method is called with
<code>$status</code> begin at the start of processing the request and
with <code>$state</code> end before the request method returns. In
between these <code>$status</code> will be the fraction of the response
currently received or the string tick if the fraction can't be
calculated.</p>
<p>When <code>$status</code> is begin the second argument is the
HTTP::Request object, otherwise it is the HTTP::Response object.</p>
<h2>redirect_ok</h2>
<p>my $bool = $ua-&gt;redirect_ok( $prospective_request, $response
);</p>
<p>This method is called by request in LWP::UserAgent before it tries to
follow a redirection to the request in <code>$response</code>. This
should return a true value if this redirection is permissible. The
<code>$prospective_request</code> will be the request to be sent if this
method returns true.</p>
<p>The base implementation will return false unless the method is in the
object's <code>requests_redirectable</code> list, false if the proposed
redirection is to a <code>file://...</code> URL, and true otherwise.</p>
<h1>BEST PRACTICES</h1>
<p>The default settings can get you up and running quickly, but there
are settings you can change in order to make your life easier.</p>
<h2>Handling Cookies</h2>
<p>You are encouraged to install Mozilla::PublicSuffix and use
HTTP::CookieJar::LWP as your cookie jar. HTTP::CookieJar::LWP provides a
better security model matching that of current Web browsers when
Mozilla::PublicSuffix is installed.</p>
<p>use HTTP::CookieJar::LWP (); my $jar = HTTP::CookieJar::LWP-&gt;new;
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( cookie_jar =&gt; $jar );</p>
<p>See cookie_jar for more information.</p>
<h2>Managing Protocols</h2>
<p><code>protocols_allowed</code> gives you the ability to allow
arbitrary protocols.</p>
<p>my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( protocols_allowed =&gt; [ http,
https ] );</p>
<p>This will prevent you from inadvertently following URLs like
<code>file:///etc/passwd</code>. See protocols_allowed.</p>
<p><code>protocols_forbidden</code> gives you the ability to deny
arbitrary protocols.</p>
<p>my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( protocols_forbidden =&gt; [ file,
mailto, ssh, ] );</p>
<p>This can also prevent you from inadvertently following URLs like
<code>file:///etc/passwd</code>. See protocols_forbidden.</p>
