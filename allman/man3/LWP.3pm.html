<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>LWP - The World-Wide Web library for Perl</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use LWP; print "This is libwww-perl-$LWP::VERSION\n";</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The libwww-perl collection is a set of Perl modules which provides a
simple and consistent application programming interface (API) to the
World-Wide Web. The main focus of the library is to provide classes and
functions that allow you to write WWW clients. The library also contain
modules that are of more general use and even classes that help you
implement simple HTTP servers.</p>
<p>Most modules in this library provide an object oriented API. The user
agent, requests sent and responses received from the WWW server are all
represented by objects. This makes a simple and powerful interface to
these services. The interface is easy to extend and customize for your
own needs.</p>
<p>The main features of the library are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contains various reusable components (modules) that can be used
separately or together.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides an object oriented model of HTTP-style communication.
Within this framework we currently support access to <code>http</code>,
<code>https</code>, <code>gopher</code>, <code>ftp</code>,
<code>news</code>, <code>file</code>, and <code>mailto</code>
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a full object oriented interface or a very simple
procedural interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports the basic and digest authorization schemes.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports transparent redirect handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports access through proxy servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides parser for <em>robots.txt</em> files and a framework for
constructing robots.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports parsing of HTML forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Implements HTTP content negotiation algorithm that can be used
both in protocol modules and in server scripts (like CGI
scripts).</p></li>
<li><p>Supports HTTP cookies.</p></li>
<li><p>Some simple command line clients, for instance
<code>lwp-request</code> and <code>lwp-download</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>HTTP STYLE COMMUNICATION</h1>
<p>The libwww-perl library is based on HTTP style communication. This
section tries to describe what that means.</p>
<p>Let us start with this quote from the HTTP specification document
&lt;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/&gt;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The HTTP protocol is based on a request/response paradigm. A
client establishes a connection with a server and sends a request to the
server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version,
followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client
information, and possible body content. The server responds with a
status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or
error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server
information, entity meta-information, and possible body
content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What this means to libwww-perl is that communication always take
place through these steps: First a <em>request</em> object is created
and configured. This object is then passed to a server and we get a
<em>response</em> object in return that we can examine. A request is
always independent of any previous requests, i.e. the service is
stateless. The same simple model is used for any kind of service we want
to access.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to fetch a document from a remote file
server, then we send it a request that contains a name for that document
and the response will contain the document itself. If we access a search
engine, then the content of the request will contain the query
parameters and the response will contain the query result. If we want to
send a mail message to somebody then we send a request object which
contains our message to the mail server and the response object will
contain an acknowledgment that tells us that the message has been
accepted and will be forwarded to the recipient(s).</p>
<p>It is as simple as that!</p>
<h2>The Request Object</h2>
<p>The libwww-perl request object has the class name HTTP::Request. The
fact that the class name uses <code>HTTP::</code> as a prefix only
implies that we use the HTTP model of communication. It does not limit
the kind of services we can try to pass this <em>request</em> to. For
instance, we will send HTTP::Requests both to ftp and gopher servers, as
well as to the local file system.</p>
<p>The main attributes of the request objects are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>method</strong> is a short string that tells what kind of
request this is. The most common methods are <strong>GET</strong>,
<strong>PUT</strong>, <strong>POST</strong> and
<strong>HEAD</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>uri</strong> is a string denoting the protocol, server
and the name of the document we want to access. The <strong>uri</strong>
might also encode various other parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>headers</strong> contains additional information about
the request and can also used to describe the content. The headers are a
set of keyword/value pairs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>content</strong> is an arbitrary amount of data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Response Object</h2>
<p>The libwww-perl response object has the class name HTTP::Response.
The main attributes of objects of this class are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>code</strong> is a numerical value that indicates the
overall outcome of the request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>message</strong> is a short, human readable string that
corresponds to the <em>code</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>headers</strong> contains additional information about
the response and describe the content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>content</strong> is an arbitrary amount of data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since we don't want to handle all possible <em>code</em> values
directly in our programs, a libwww-perl response object has methods that
can be used to query what kind of response this is. The most commonly
used response classification methods are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>is_success()</dt>
<dd>
<p>The request was successfully received, understood or accepted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>is_error()</dt>
<dd>
<p>The request failed. The server or the resource might not be
available, access to the resource might be denied or other things might
have failed for some reason.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>The User Agent</h2>
<p>Let us assume that we have created a <em>request</em> object. What do
we actually do with it in order to receive a <em>response</em>?</p>
<p>The answer is that you pass it to a <em>user agent</em> object and
this object takes care of all the things that need to be done (like
low-level communication and error handling) and returns a
<em>response</em> object. The user agent represents your application on
the network and provides you with an interface that can accept
<em>requests</em> and return <em>responses</em>.</p>
<p>The user agent is an interface layer between your application code
and the network. Through this interface you are able to access the
various servers on the network.</p>
<p>The class name for the user agent is LWP::UserAgent. Every
libwww-perl application that wants to communicate should create at least
one object of this class. The main method provided by this object is
<strong>request()</strong>. This method takes an HTTP::Request object as
argument and (eventually) returns a HTTP::Response object.</p>
<p>The user agent has many other attributes that let you configure how
it will interact with the network and with your application.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>timeout</strong> specifies how much time we give remote
servers to respond before the library disconnects and creates an
internal <em>timeout</em> response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>agent</strong> specifies the name that your application
uses when it presents itself on the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>from</strong> can be set to the e-mail address of the
person responsible for running the application. If this is set, then the
address will be sent to the servers with every request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>parse_head</strong> specifies whether we should
initialize response headers from the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section
of HTML documents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>proxy</strong> and <strong>no_proxy</strong> specify if
and when to go through a proxy server.
&lt;http://www.w3.org/History/1994/WWW/Proxies/&gt;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>credentials</strong> provides a way to set up user names
and passwords needed to access certain services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many applications want even more control over how they interact with
the network and they get this by sub-classing LWP::UserAgent. The
library includes a sub-class, LWP::RobotUA, for robot applications.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>This example shows how the user agent, a request and a response are
represented in actual perl code:</p>
<p># Create a user agent object use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua =
LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new; $ua-&gt;agent("MyApp/0.1 "); # Create a request
my $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt;
http://search.cpan.org/search);
$req-&gt;content_type(application/x-www-form-urlencoded);
$req-&gt;content(query=libwww-perl&amp;mode=dist); # Pass request to the
user agent and get a response back my $res = $ua-&gt;request($req); #
Check the outcome of the response if ($res-&gt;is_success) { print
$res-&gt;content; } else { print $res-&gt;status_line, "\n"; }</p>
<p>The <code>$ua</code> is created once when the application starts up.
New request objects should normally created for each request sent.</p>
<h1>NETWORK SUPPORT</h1>
<p>This section discusses the various protocol schemes and the HTTP
style methods that headers may be used for each.</p>
<p>For all requests, a User-Agent header is added and initialized from
the <code>$ua-&gt;agent</code> attribute before the request is handed to
the network layer. In the same way, a From header is initialized from
the <code>$ua</code>-&gt;from attribute.</p>
<p>For all responses, the library adds a header called Client-Date. This
header holds the time when the response was received by your
application. The format and semantics of the header are the same as the
server created Date header. You may also encounter other Client-XXX
headers. They are all generated by the library internally and are not
received from the servers.</p>
<h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
<p>HTTP requests are just handed off to an HTTP server and it decides
what happens. Few servers implement methods beside the usual GET, HEAD,
POST and PUT, but CGI-scripts may implement any method they like.</p>
<p>If the server is not available then the library will generate an
internal error response.</p>
<p>The library automatically adds a Host and a Content-Length header to
the HTTP request before it is sent over the network.</p>
<p>For a GET request you might want to add an If-Modified-Since or
If-None-Match header to make the request conditional.</p>
<p>For a POST request you should add the Content-Type header. When you
try to emulate HTML &lt;FORM&gt; handling you should usually let the
value of the Content-Type header be application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
See lwpcook for examples of this.</p>
<p>The libwww-perl HTTP implementation currently support the HTTP/1.1
and HTTP/1.0 protocol.</p>
<p>The library allows you to access proxy server through HTTP. This
means that you can set up the library to forward all types of request
through the HTTP protocol module. See LWP::UserAgent for documentation
of this.</p>
<h2>HTTPS Requests</h2>
<p>HTTPS requests are HTTP requests over an encrypted network connection
using the SSL protocol developed by Netscape. Everything about HTTP
requests above also apply to HTTPS requests. In addition the library
will add the headers Client-SSL-Cipher, Client-SSL-Cert-Subject and
Client-SSL-Cert-Issuer to the response. These headers denote the
encryption method used and the name of the server owner.</p>
<p>The request can contain the header If-SSL-Cert-Subject in order to
make the request conditional on the content of the server certificate.
If the certificate subject does not match, no request is sent to the
server and an internally generated error response is returned. The value
of the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header is interpreted as a Perl regular
expression.</p>
<h2>FTP Requests</h2>
<p>The library currently supports GET, HEAD and PUT requests. GET
retrieves a file or a directory listing from an FTP server. PUT stores a
file on a ftp server.</p>
<p>You can specify a ftp account for servers that want this in addition
to user name and password. This is specified by including an Account
header in the request.</p>
<p>User name/password can be specified using basic authorization or be
encoded in the URL. Failed logins return an UNAUTHORIZED response with
WWW-Authenticate: Basic and can be treated like basic authorization for
HTTP.</p>
<p>The library supports ftp ASCII transfer mode by specifying the type=a
parameter in the URL. It also supports transfer of ranges for FTP
transfers using the Range header.</p>
<p>Directory listings are by default returned unprocessed (as returned
from the ftp server) with the content media type reported to be
text/ftp-dir-listing. The File::Listing module provides methods for
parsing of these directory listing.</p>
<p>The ftp module is also able to convert directory listings to HTML and
this can be requested via the standard HTTP content negotiation
mechanisms (add an Accept: text/html header in the request if you want
this).</p>
<p>For normal file retrievals, the Content-Type is guessed based on the
file name suffix. See LWP::MediaTypes.</p>
<p>The If-Modified-Since request header works for servers that implement
the <code>MDTM</code> command. It will probably not work for directory
listings though.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>$req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt;
ftp://me:passwd@ftp.some.where.com/); $req-&gt;header(Accept =&gt;
"text/html, */*;q=0.1");</p>
<h2>News Requests</h2>
<p>Access to the USENET News system is implemented through the NNTP
protocol. The name of the news server is obtained from the NNTP_SERVER
environment variable and defaults to news. It is not possible to specify
the hostname of the NNTP server in news: URLs.</p>
<p>The library supports GET and HEAD to retrieve news articles through
the NNTP protocol. You can also post articles to newsgroups by using
(surprise!) the POST method.</p>
<p>GET on newsgroups is not implemented yet.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>$req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; news:abc1234@a.sn.no); $req =
HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; news:comp.lang.perl.test);
$req-&gt;header(Subject =&gt; This is a test, From =&gt;
me@some.where.org); $req-&gt;content(&lt;&lt;EOT); This is the content
of the message that we are sending to the world. EOT</p>
<h2>Gopher Request</h2>
<p>The library supports the GET and HEAD methods for gopher requests.
All request header values are ignored. HEAD cheats and returns a
response without even talking to server.</p>
<p>Gopher menus are always converted to HTML.</p>
<p>The response Content-Type is generated from the document type encoded
(as the first letter) in the request URL path itself.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>$req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; gopher://gopher.sn.no/);</p>
<h2>File Request</h2>
<p>The library supports GET and HEAD methods for file requests. The
If-Modified-Since header is supported. All other headers are ignored.
The <em>host</em> component of the file URL must be empty or set to
localhost. Any other <em>host</em> value will be treated as an
error.</p>
<p>Directories are always converted to an HTML document. For normal
files, the Content-Type and Content-Encoding in the response are guessed
based on the file suffix.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>$req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; file:/etc/passwd);</p>
<h2>Mailto Request</h2>
<p>You can send (aka POST) mail messages using the library. All headers
specified for the request are passed on to the mail system. The To
header is initialized from the mail address in the URL.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>$req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; mailto:libwww@perl.org);
$req-&gt;header(Subject =&gt; "subscribe"); $req-&gt;content("Please
subscribe me to the libwww-perl mailing list!\n");</p>
<h2>CPAN Requests</h2>
<p>URLs with scheme <code>cpan:</code> are redirected to a suitable CPAN
mirror. If you have your own local mirror of CPAN you might tell LWP to
use it for <code>cpan:</code> URLs by an assignment like this:</p>
<p>$LWP::Protocol::cpan::CPAN = "file:/local/CPAN/";</p>
<p>Suitable CPAN mirrors are also picked up from the configuration for
the CPAN.pm, so if you have used that module a suitable mirror should be
picked automatically. If neither of these apply, then a redirect to the
generic CPAN http location is issued.</p>
<p>Example request to download the newest perl:</p>
<p>$req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; "cpan:src/latest.tar.gz");</p>

<h1>MORE DOCUMENTATION</h1>
<p>All modules contain detailed information on the interfaces they
provide. The lwpcook manpage is the libwww-perl cookbook that contain
examples of typical usage of the library. You might want to take a look
at how the scripts lwp-request, lwp-download, lwp-dump and lwp-mirror
are implemented.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>The following environment variables are used by LWP:</p>
<dl>
<dt>HOME</dt>
<dd>
<p>The LWP::MediaTypes functions will look for the <em>.media.types</em>
and <em>.mime.types</em> files relative to you home directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>http_proxy</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>ftp_proxy</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>xxx_proxy</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>no_proxy</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>These environment variables can be set to enable communication
through a proxy server. See the description of the
<code>env_proxy</code> method in LWP::UserAgent.</p>
<dl>
<dt>PERL_LWP_ENV_PROXY</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to a TRUE value, then the LWP::UserAgent will by default call
<code>env_proxy</code> during initialization. This makes LWP honor the
proxy variables described above.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME</dt>
<dd>
<p>The default <code>verify_hostname</code> setting for LWP::UserAgent.
If not set the default will be 1. Set it as 0 to disable hostname
verification (the default prior to libwww-perl 5.840.</p>
