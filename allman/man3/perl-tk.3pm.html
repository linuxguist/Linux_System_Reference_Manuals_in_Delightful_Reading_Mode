<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::UserGuide - Writing Tk applications in Perl 5</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This document is for beginners. It assumes you know some
<strong>Perl</strong>, and have it and Tk running. If you are
<em>not</em> currently reading this document courtesy of the
<strong>widget</strong> demonstration program, please be sure to run
<strong>widget</strong>, as it will show you the various widget types
supported by Tk and how to use them. <strong>widget</strong> should be
installed in your default path, so type <em>widget</em> at a command
prompt.</p>
<p>Here are links to other novice tutorials:</p>
<p>&lt;http://www.lehigh.edu/~sol0/ptk/tpj1.html&gt;
&lt;http://www.lehigh.edu/~sol0/ptk/perlmonth01/pm1.html&gt;</p>
<p><em>Mastering Perl/Tk</em> is the definitive book on Perl/Tk:</p>
<p>&lt;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mastperltk&gt;</p>
<h1>Some Background</h1>
<p>Tk GUI programming is event-driven. (This may already be familiar to
you.) In event-driven programs, the main GUI loop is outside of the user
program and inside the GUI library. This loop - initiated by calling
<strong>MainLoop</strong> - watches all events of interest and activates
the correct handler procedures to handle these events. Some of these
handler procedures may be user-supplied; others will be part of the
library.</p>
<p>For a programmer, this means that you're not watching what is
happening; instead, you are requested by the toolkit to perform actions
whenever necessary. So, you're not watching for 'raise window / close
window / redraw window' requests, but you tell the toolkit which routine
will handle such cases, and the toolkit will call the procedures when
required. These procedures are known as <em>callbacks</em>, and some of
them you write yourself.</p>
<h1>First Requirements</h1>
<p><strong>Perl</strong> programs that use Tk need to include
<code>use Tk</code>. A program should also use <code>use strict</code>
and the <strong>-w</strong> switch to ensure the program is working
without common errors.</p>
<p>Any Perl/Tk application starts by creating the Tk
<strong>MainWindow</strong>. You then create items inside the
<strong>MainWindow</strong>, and/or create new windows called
<strong>Toplevel</strong>s that also contain child items, before
starting the <strong>MainLoop</strong>, which is the last logical
statment in your program. You can also create more items and windows
while you're running, using callbacks. Items are only shown on the
display after they have been arranged by a <em>geometry manager</em>
like <strong>pack</strong>; more information on this later.
<strong>MainLoop</strong> starts the GUI and handle all events. That's
all there is to it! A trivial one-window example is shown below:</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk; use strict; my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new;
$mw-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; Hello, world!)-&gt;pack; $mw-&gt;Button( -text
=&gt; Quit, -command =&gt; sub { exit }, )-&gt;pack; MainLoop;</p>
<p>Please run this example. It shows you two widget types, a
<strong>Label</strong> and a <strong>Button</strong>, and how they are
packed. When clicked, the <strong>Button</strong> widget invokes the
callback specified by the <code>-command</code> option. Finally, note
the typical Tk style using <code>-option</code> =&gt; <code>value</code>
pairs.</p>
<h1>Widget creation</h1>
<p>Tk windows and widgets are hierarchical, i.e.Â one window includes one
or more other windows. You create the first Tk window using
<code>MainWindow-&gt;new</code>. This returns a window handle, assigned
to <code>$mw</code> in the example above. Keep track of the main handle,
commonly called a <em>widget reference</em>.</p>
<p>You can use any Tk handle to create child widgets within the window
(or widget). This is done by calling the Tk constructor method on the
variable. In the example above, the <code>Label</code> method called
from <code>$mw</code> creates a <strong>Label</strong> widget inside the
<strong>MainWindow</strong>. In the constructor call, you can specify
various options; you can later add or change options for any widget
using the <strong>configure</strong> method, which takes the same
parameters as the constructor. The one exception to the hierarchical
structure is the <strong>Toplevel</strong> constructor, which creates a
new outermost window.</p>
<p>After you create any widget (other than the
<strong>MainWindow</strong> or <strong>Toplevel</strong>s, you must
render it by calling <strong>pack</strong>. (This is not entirely true;
more later)). If you do not need to refer to the widget after
construction and packing, call <strong>pack</strong> off the constructor
results, as shown for the <strong>Label</strong> and
<strong>Button</strong> in the example above. Note that the result of
the compound call is the result of <strong>pack</strong>, which is a
valid Tk handle.</p>
<p>Windows and widgets are deleted by calling <strong>destroy</strong>
on them; this will delete and un-draw the widget and all its
children.</p>

<h1>Variables and callback routines</h1>
<p>Most graphical interfaces are used to set up a set of values and
conditions, and then perform the appropriate action. The Tk toolkit is
different from your average text-based prompting or menu driven system
in that you do not collect settings yourself, and decide on an action
based on an input code; instead, you leave these values to your toolkit
and only get them when the action is performed.</p>
<p>So, where a traditional text-based system would look like this:</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; print "Please type a font name\n"; my
$font = &lt;&gt;; chomp $font; # Validate font print "Please type a file
name\n"; my $filename = &lt;&gt;; chomp $filename; # Validate filename
print "Type &lt;1&gt; to fax, &lt;2&gt; to print\n"; my $option =
&lt;&gt;; chomp $option; if ($option eq 1) { print "Faxing $filename in
font $font\n"; } elsif ($option eq 2) { print "Now sending $filename to
printer in font $font\n"; }</p>
<p>The slightly larger example below shows how to do this in Tk. Note
the use of callbacks. Note, also, that Tk handles the values, and the
subroutine uses the method <strong>get</strong> to get at the values. If
a user changes his mind and wants to change the font again, the
application never notices; it's all handled by Tk.</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk; use strict; my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new;
$mw-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; File Name)-&gt;pack; my $filename =
$mw-&gt;Entry(-width =&gt; 20); $filename-&gt;pack; $mw-&gt;Label(-text
=&gt; Font Name)-&gt;pack; my $font = $mw-&gt;Entry(-width =&gt; 10);
$font-&gt;pack; $mw-&gt;Button( -text =&gt; Fax, -command =&gt;
sub{do_fax($filename, $font)} )-&gt;pack; $mw-&gt;Button( -text =&gt;
Print, -command =&gt; sub{do_print($filename, $font)} )-&gt;pack;
MainLoop; sub do_fax { my ($file, $font) = @_; my $file_val =
$file-&gt;get; my $font_val = $font-&gt;get; print "Now faxing $file_val
in font $font_val\n"; } sub do_print { my ($file, $font) = @_; my
$file_val = $file-&gt;get; my $font_val = $font-&gt;get; print "Sending
file $file_val to printer in font $font_val\n"; }</p>
<h1>The packer - grouping with Frame widgets</h1>
<p>In the examples above, you must have noticed the
<strong>pack</strong> calls. This is one of the more complicated parts
of Tk. The basic idea is that any window or widget should be subject to
a Tk geometry manager; the <em>packer</em> is one of the placement
managers, and <strong>grid</strong> is another.</p>
<p>The actions of the packer are rather simple: when applied to a
widget, the packer positions that widget on the indicated position
within the remaining space in its parent. By default, the position is on
top; this means the next items will be put below. You can also specify
the left, right, or bottom positions. Specify position using
<strong>-side =&gt; 'right'</strong>.</p>
<p>Additional packing parameters specify the behavior of the widget when
there is some space left in the <strong>Frame</strong> or when the
window size is increased. If widgets should maintain a fixed size,
specify nothing; this is the default. For widgets that you want to fill
up the current horizontal and/or vertical space, specify <strong>-fill
=&gt; 'x'</strong>, <strong>'y'</strong>, or <strong>'both'</strong>;
for widgets that should grow, specify <strong>-expand =&gt; 1</strong>.
These parameters are not shown in the example below; see the
<strong>widget</strong> demonstration.</p>
<p>If you want to group some items within a window that have a different
packing order than others, you can include them in a Frame. This is a
do-nothing window type that is meant for packing or filling (and to play
games with borders and colors).</p>
<p>The example below shows the use of pack and Frames:</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk; use strict; # Take top and the bottom -
now implicit top is in the middle my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new;
$mw-&gt;title( The MainWindow ); $mw-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; At the top
(default))-&gt;pack; $mw-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; At the
bottom)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; bottom); $mw-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; The
middle remains)-&gt;pack; # Since left and right are taken, bottom will
not work... my $top1 = $mw-&gt;Toplevel; $top1-&gt;title( Toplevel 1 );
$top1-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; Left)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; left);
$top1-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; Right)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; right);
$top1-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; ?Bottom?)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; bottom); #
But when you use Frames, things work quite alright my $top2 =
$mw-&gt;Toplevel; $top2-&gt;title( Toplevel 2 ); my $frame =
$top2-&gt;Frame; $frame-&gt;pack; $frame-&gt;Label(-text =&gt;
Left2)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; left); $frame-&gt;Label(-text =&gt;
Right2)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; right); $top2-&gt;Label(-text =&gt;
Bottom2)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; bottom); MainLoop;</p>
<h1>More than one window</h1>
<p>Most real applications require more than one window. As you just saw,
you can create more outermost windows by using a
<strong>Toplevel</strong> widget. Each window is independent; destroying
a <strong>Toplevel</strong> window does not affect the others as long as
they are not a child of the closed <strong>Toplevel</strong>. However,
exiting the <strong>MainWindow</strong> will destroy all remaining
<strong>Toplevel</strong> widgets and end the application. The example
below shows a trivial three-window application:</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk; use strict; my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new;
fill_window($mw, Main); my $top1 = $mw-&gt;Toplevel; fill_window($top1,
First top-level); my $top2 = $mw-&gt;Toplevel; fill_window($top2, Second
top-level); MainLoop; sub fill_window { my ($window, $header) = @_;
$window-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; $header)-&gt;pack; $window-&gt;Button(
-text =&gt; close, -command =&gt; [$window =&gt; destroy]
)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; left); $window-&gt;Button( -text =&gt; exit,
-command =&gt; [$mw =&gt; destroy] )-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; right); }</p>
<h1>More callbacks</h1>
<p>So far, all callback routines shown called a user procedure. You can
also have a callback routine call another Tk routine. This is the way
that scroll bars are implemented: scroll-bars can call a Tk item or a
user procedure, whenever their position has changed. The Tk item that
has a scrollbar attached calls the scrollbar when its size or offset has
changed. In this way, the items are linked. You can still ask a
scrollbar's position, or set it by hand - but the defaults will be taken
care of.</p>
<p>The example below shows a <strong>Listbox</strong> with a scroll bar.
Moving the scrollbar moves the <strong>Listbox</strong>. Scanning a
<strong>Listbox</strong> (dragging an item with the left mouse button)
moves the scrollbar.</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk; use strict; my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new;
my $box = $mw-&gt;Listbox( -relief =&gt; sunken, -height =&gt; 5,
-setgrid =&gt; 1, ); my @items = qw(One Two Three Four Five Six Seven
Eight Nine Ten Eleven Twelve); foreach (@items) { $box-&gt;insert(end,
$_); } my $scroll = $mw-&gt;Scrollbar(-command =&gt; [yview, $box]);
$box-&gt;configure(-yscrollcommand =&gt; [set, $scroll]);
$box-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; left, -fill =&gt; both, -expand =&gt; 1);
$scroll-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; right, -fill =&gt; y); MainLoop;</p>
<p>Note that there's a convenience method <strong>Scrolled</strong>
which helps constructing widgets with automatically managed
scrollbars.</p>
<h1>Canvases and tags</h1>
<p>One of the most powerful widgets in Tk is the <strong>Canvas</strong>
window. In a <strong>Canvas</strong> window, you can draw simple
graphics and include other widgets. The <strong>Canvas</strong> area may
be larger than the visible window, and may then be scrolled. Any item
you draw on the canvas has its own id, and may optionally have one or
more <em>tags</em>. You may refer to any item by its id, and may refer
to any group of items by a common tag; you can move, delete, or change
groups of items using these tags, and you can <em>bind</em> actions to
tags. For a properly designed (often structured)
<strong>Canvas</strong>, you can specify powerful actions quite
simply.</p>
<p>In the example below, actions are bound to circles (single click) and
blue items (double-click); obviously, this can be extended to any tag or
group of tags.</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk; use strict; # Create B&lt;MainWindow&gt;
and canvas my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new; my $canvas = $mw-&gt;Canvas;
$canvas-&gt;pack(-expand =&gt; 1, -fill =&gt; both); # Create various
items create_item($canvas, 1, 1, circle, blue, Jane);
create_item($canvas, 4, 4, circle, red, Peter); create_item($canvas, 4,
1, square, blue, James); create_item($canvas, 1, 4, square, red,
Patricia); # Single-clicking with left on a circle item invokes a
procedure $canvas-&gt;bind(circle, &lt;1&gt; =&gt; sub
{handle_circle($canvas)}); # Double-clicking with left on a blue item
invokes a procedure $canvas-&gt;bind(blue, &lt;Double-1&gt; =&gt; sub
{handle_blue($canvas)}); MainLoop; # Create an item; use parameters as
tags (this is not a default!) sub create_item { my ($can, $x, $y, $form,
$color, $name) = @_; my $x2 = $x + 1; my $y2 = $y + 1; my $kind; $kind =
oval if ($form eq circle); $kind = rectangle if ($form eq square);
$can-&gt;create( ($kind, "$x" . c, "$y" . c, "$x2" . c, "$y2" . c),
-tags =&gt; [$form, $color, $name], -fill =&gt; $color); } # This gets
the real name (not current, blue/red, square/circle) # Note: youll want
to return a list in realistic situations... sub get_name { my ($can) =
@_; my $item = $can-&gt;find(withtag, current); my @taglist =
$can-&gt;gettags($item); my $name; foreach (@taglist) { next if ($_ eq
current); next if ($_ eq red or $_ eq blue); next if ($_ eq square or $_
eq circle); $name = $_; last; } return $name; } sub handle_circle { my
($can) = @_; my $name = get_name($can); print "Action on circle
$name...\n"; } sub handle_blue { my ($can) = @_; my $name =
get_name($can); print "Action on blue item $name...\n"; }</p>
<h1>Perl/Tk and Unicode</h1>
<p>Perl/Tk follows Perl's model of handling Unicode. That is, if a
string is correctly flagged as a character string in the sense like
described in TERMINOLOGY in Encode, then Perl/Tk will very probably
display and handle this string correctly.</p>
<p>Note that every variable which is passed somehow into a Perl/Tk
method will be implicitely changed into an internally utf8-flagged
variable. Semantically nothing changes, as the series of codepoints
stays the same, but things will change when variables with high-bit
iso-8859-1 characters will be passed to the outer world. In this case
you have to explicitly mark the encoding of your output stream if using
IO, or encode the variables using Encode for other style of
communication.</p>
<p>This is the theory, now some examples.</p>
<p>If you use non-iso-8859-1 characters in the source code, then use
either the <code>use utf8;</code> or
<code>use encoding </code><em><code>encodingname</code></em> pragma:</p>
<p>use utf8; use Tk; my $x = "some characters using utf8 encoding";
tkinit-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; $x)-&gt;pack; MainLoop;</p>
<p>For data that comes from a file you have to specify the encoding
unless it's encoded as ascii or iso-8559-1:</p>
<p>use Tk; open my $FH, "&lt;:encoding(utf-8)", "filename" or die $!; #
or for utf-16 data: open my $FH, "&lt;:encoding(utf-16)", "filename" or
die $!; my $data = &lt;$FH&gt;; tkinit-&gt;Label(-text =&gt;
$data)-&gt;pack; MainLoop;</p>
<p>Likewise, the encoding must be specified for all data which is read
from Tk widgets and that shall be output into a file. For the output,
the encoding should be always specified, even if it is iso-8859-1:</p>
<p>use Tk; $mw = tkinit; $mw-&gt;Entry(-textvariable =&gt;
\$input)-&gt;pack; $mw-&gt;Button( -text =&gt; "Write to file", -command
=&gt; sub { open my $FH, "&gt;:encoding(iso-8859-1)", "filename" or die
$!; print $FH $input; }, )-&gt;pack; MainLoop;</p>
<p>Note that Tk is Unicode-capable. So you need to be prepared that the
user has the appropriate input methods activated to enter non-ascii
characters. If an output encoding is used which does not cover the whole
of Unicode codepoints then a warning will be issued when writing the
file, like this:</p>
<p>"\x{20ac}" does not map to iso-8859-1 at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/mach/Tk.pm line 250.</p>
<p>Also, the same hexadecimal notation will be used as replacements for
the unhandled characters.</p>
<p>Handling encoding in I/O is pretty simple using the
<code>encoding</code> PerlIO layer, as described above. In other cases,
such as when dealing with databases, encoding the data usually has to be
done manually, unless the database driver has some means for
automatically do this for you. So when working with a MySQL database,
one could use:</p>
<p>use Tk; use DBI; use Encode qw(encode); $mw = tkinit;
$mw-&gt;Entry(-textvariable =&gt; \$input)-&gt;pack; $mw-&gt;Button(
-text =&gt; "Write to database", -command =&gt; sub { my $dbh =
DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:mysql:test", "root", "") or die; my $encoded_input
= encode("iso-8859-1", $input); $dbh-&gt;do("INSERT INTO testtable
VALUES (?)", undef, $encoded_input) or die; }, )-&gt;pack; MainLoop;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are still places in Perl ignorant of Unicode.
One of these places are filenames. Consequently, the file selectors in
Perl/Tk do not handle encoding of filenames properly. Currently they
suppose that filenames are in iso-8859-1 encoding, at least on Unix
systems. As soon as Perl has a concept of filename encodings, then
Perl/Tk will also implement such schemes.</p>
