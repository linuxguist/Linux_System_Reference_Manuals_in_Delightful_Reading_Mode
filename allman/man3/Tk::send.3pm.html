<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::send - Execute a command in a different application</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>    <em><code>$result</code></em> =
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>send</strong>(?<em>options</em>,?<em>app</em>=&gt;<em>cmd</em>?<em>arg
arg ...</em>?)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This method arranges for <em>cmd</em> (and <em>arg</em>s) to be
'sent' to the application named by <em>app</em>. It returns the result
or an error (hence above should probably be 'wrapped' in
<strong>eval{}</strong> and $@ tested). <em>App</em> may be the name of
any application whose main window is on the display containing the
sender's main window; it need not be within the same process. If no
<em>arg</em> arguments are present, then the string to be sent is
contained entirely within the <em>cmd</em> argument. If one or more
<em>arg</em>s are present, they are concatenated separated by white
space to form the string to be sent.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments of the call begin with ``-'' they are
treated as options. The following options are currently defined:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-async</dt>
<dd>
<p>Requests asynchronous invocation. In this case the
<strong>send</strong> command will complete immediately without waiting
for <em>cmd</em> to complete in the target application; no result will
be available and errors in the sent command will be ignored. If the
target application is in the same process as the sending application
then the <strong>-async</strong> option is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--</dt>
<dd>
<p>Serves no purpose except to terminate the list of options. This
option is needed only if <em>app</em> could contain a leading ``-''
character.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>APPLICATION NAMES</h1>
<p>The name of an application is set initially from the name of the
program or script that created the application. You can query and change
the name of an application with the <strong>appname</strong> method.</p>
<h1>WHAT IS A SEND</h1>
<p>The <strong>send</strong> mechanism was designed to allow Tcl/Tk
applications to send Tcl Scripts to each other. This does not map very
well onto perl/Tk. Perl/Tk sends a string to <em>app</em>, what happens
as a result of this depends on the receiving application. If the other
application is a Tcl/Tk4.* application it will be treated as a Tcl
Script. If the other application is perl/Tk application (including sends
to self) then the string is passed as an argument to a method call of
the following form:</p>
<p><em><code>$mainwindow</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Receive(</strong><em>string</em>);</p>
<p>There is a default (AutoLoaded) <strong>Tk::Receive</strong> which
returns an error to the sending application. A particular application
may define its own <strong>Receive</strong> method in any class in
<strong>MainWindow</strong>'s inheritance tree to do whatever it sees
fit. For example it could <strong>eval</strong> the string, possibly in
a <strong>Safe</strong> compartment.</p>
<p>If a Tcl/Tk application sends anything to a perl/Tk application then
the perl/Tk application would have to attempt to interpret the incoming
string as a Tcl Script. Simple cases are should not be too hard to
emulate (split on white space and treat first element as command and
other elements as arguments).</p>
<h1>SECURITY</h1>
<p>The <strong>send</strong> command is potentially a serious security
loophole, since any application that can connect to your X server can
send scripts to your applications. Hence the default behaviour outlined
above. (With the availability of <strong>Safe</strong> it may make sense
to relax default behaviour a little.)</p>
<p>Unmonitored <strong>eval</strong>'ing of these incoming scripts can
cause perl to read and write files and invoke subprocesses under your
name. Host-based access control such as that provided by
<strong>xhost</strong> is particularly insecure, since it allows anyone
with an account on particular hosts to connect to your server, and if
disabled it allows anyone anywhere to connect to your server. In order
to provide at least a small amount of security, core Tk checks the
access control being used by the server and rejects incoming sends
unless (a) <strong>xhost</strong>-style access control is enabled (i.e.
only certain hosts can establish connections) and (b) the list of
enabled hosts is empty. This means that applications cannot connect to
your server unless they use some other form of authorization such as
that provide by <strong>xauth</strong>.</p>
