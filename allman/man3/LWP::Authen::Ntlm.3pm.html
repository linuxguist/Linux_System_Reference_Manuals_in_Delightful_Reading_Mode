<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>LWP::Authen::Ntlm - Library for enabling NTLM authentication
(Microsoft) in LWP</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use LWP::UserAgent; use HTTP::Request::Common; my $url =
http://www.company.com/protected_page.html; # Set up the ntlm client and
then the base64 encoded ntlm handshake message my $ua =
LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new(keep_alive=&gt;1);
$ua-&gt;credentials(www.company.com:80, , "MyDomain\\MyUserCode",
MyPassword); $request = GET $url; print "--Performing request
now...-----------\n"; $response = $ua-&gt;request($request); print
"--Done with request-------------------\n"; if
($response-&gt;is_success) {print "It worked!-&gt;" . $response-&gt;code
. "\n"} else {print "It didnt work!-&gt;" . $response-&gt;code .
"\n"}</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>LWP::Authen::Ntlm allows LWP to authenticate against servers that are
using the NTLM authentication scheme popularized by Microsoft. This type
of authentication is common on intranets of Microsoft-centric
organizations.</p>
<p>The module takes advantage of the Authen::NTLM module by Mark Bush.
Since there is also another Authen::NTLM module available from CPAN by
Yee Man Chan with an entirely different interface, it is necessary to
ensure that you have the correct NTLM module.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been problems with incompatibilities between
different versions of Mime::Base64, which Bush's Authen::NTLM makes use
of. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that your Mime::Base64 module
supports exporting of the <code>encode_base64</code> and
<code>decode_base64</code> functions.</p>
<h1>USAGE</h1>
<p>The module is used indirectly through LWP, rather than including it
directly in your code. The LWP system will invoke the NTLM
authentication when it encounters the authentication scheme while
attempting to retrieve a URL from a server. In order for the NTLM
authentication to work, you must have a few things set up in your code
prior to attempting to retrieve the URL:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable persistent HTTP connections To do this, pass the
<code>"keep_alive=&gt;1"</code> option to the LWP::UserAgent when
creating it, like this: my $ua =
LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new(keep_alive=&gt;1);</p></li>
<li><p>Set the credentials on the UserAgent object The credentials must
be set like this: $ua-&gt;credentials(www.company.com:80, ,
"MyDomain\\MyUserCode", MyPassword); Note that you cannot use the
HTTP::Request object's <code>authorization_basic()</code> method to set
the credentials. Note, too, that the <code>www.company.com:80</code>
portion only sets credentials on the specified port AND it is
case-sensitive (this is due to the way LWP is coded, and has nothing to
do with LWP::Authen::Ntlm)</p></li>
</ul>
