<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::focus - Manage the input focus</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>   <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>focus</strong></p>
<p>   <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>focus</strong><em>Option</em></p>
<p>   <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>focusNext</strong></p>
<p>   <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>focusPrev</strong></p>
<p>   <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>focusFollowsMouse</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>focus</strong> methods are used to manage the Tk input
focus. At any given time, one window on each display is designated as
the <em>focus window</em>; any key press or key release events for the
display are sent to that window. It is normally up to the window manager
to redirect the focus among the top-level windows of a display. For
example, some window managers automatically set the input focus to a
top-level window whenever the mouse enters it; others redirect the input
focus only when the user clicks on a window. Usually the window manager
will set the focus only to top-level windows, leaving it up to the
application to redirect the focus among the children of the
top-level.</p>
<p>Tk remembers one focus window for each top-level (the most recent
descendant of that top-level to receive the focus); when the window
manager gives the focus to a top-level, Tk automatically redirects it to
the remembered window. Within a top-level Tk uses an <em>explicit</em>
focus model by default. Moving the mouse within a top-level does not
normally change the focus; the focus changes only when a widget decides
explicitly to claim the focus (e.g., because of a button click), or when
the user types a key such as Tab that moves the focus.</p>
<p>The method <strong>focusFollowsMouse</strong> may be invoked to
create an <em>implicit</em> focus model: it reconfigures Tk so that the
focus is set to a window whenever the mouse enters it. The methods
<strong>focusNext</strong> and <strong>focusPrev</strong> implement a
focus order among the windows of a top-level; they are used in the
default bindings for Tab and Shift-Tab, among other things.</p>
<p>The <strong>focus</strong> methods can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;focusCurrent</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the focus window on the display containing the
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, or an empty string if no window in this
application has the focus on that display.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;focus</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the application currently has the input focus on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display, this command resets the input
focus for <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display to
<em><code>$widget</code></em> and returns an empty string. If the
application doesn't currently have the input focus on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display, <em><code>$widget</code></em>
will be remembered as the focus for its top-level; the next time the
focus arrives at the top-level, Tk will redirect it to
<em><code>$widget</code></em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;focusForce</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the focus of <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display to
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, even if the application doesn't currently
have the input focus for the display. This command should be used
sparingly, if at all. In normal usage, an application should not claim
the focus for itself; instead, it should wait for the window manager to
give it the focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;focusLastfor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the most recent window to have the input focus
among all the windows in the same top-level as
<em><code>$widget</code></em>. If no window in that top-level has ever
had the input focus, or if the most recent focus window has been
deleted, then the top-level is returned. The return value is the window
that will receive the input focus the next time the window manager gives
the focus to the top-level.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;focusNext</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;focusPrev</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>focusNext</strong> is a utility method used for keyboard
traversal, but can be useful in other contexts. It sets the focus to the
``next'' window after <em><code>$widget</code></em> in focus order. The
focus order is determined by the stacking order of windows and the
structure of the window hierarchy. Among siblings, the focus order is
the same as the stacking order, with the lowest window being first. If a
window has children, the window is visited first, followed by its
children (recursively), followed by its next sibling. Top-level windows
other than <em><code>$widget</code></em> are skipped, so that
<strong>focusNext</strong> never returns a window in a different
top-level from <em><code>$widget</code></em>. After computing the next
window, <strong>focusNext</strong> examines the window's
<strong>-takefocus</strong> option to see whether it should be skipped.
If so, <strong>focusNext</strong> continues on to the next window in the
focus order, until it eventually finds a window that will accept the
focus or returns back to <em><code>$widget</code></em>.
<strong>focusPrev</strong> is similar to <strong>focusNext</strong>
except that it sets the focus to the window just before
<em><code>$widget</code></em> in the focus order.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;focusFollowsMouse</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>focusFollowsMouse</strong> changes the focus model for the
application to an implicit one where the window under the mouse gets the
focus. After this procedure is called, whenever the mouse enters a
window Tk will automatically give it the input focus. The
<strong>focus</strong> command may be used to move the focus to a window
other than the one under the mouse, but as soon as the mouse moves into
a new window the focus will jump to that window. Note: at present there
is no built-in support for returning the application to an explicit
focus model; to do this you'll have to write a script that deletes the
bindings created by <strong>focusFollowsMouse</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>QUIRKS</h1>
<p>When an internal window receives the input focus, Tk doesn't actually
set the X focus to that window; as far as X is concerned, the focus will
stay on the top-level window containing the window with the focus.
However, Tk generates FocusIn and FocusOut events just as if the X focus
were on the internal window. This approach gets around a number of
problems that would occur if the X focus were actually moved; the fact
that the X focus is on the top-level is invisible unless you use C code
to query the X server directly.</p>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>Note that for the <strong>Canvas</strong> widget, the call to
<strong>focus</strong> has to be fully qualified. This is because there
is already a focus method for the <strong>Canvas</strong> widget, which
sets the focus on individual canvas tags.</p>
