<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>URI::Escape - Percent-encode and percent-decode unsafe characters</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use URI::Escape; $safe = uri_escape("10% is enough\n"); $verysafe =
uri_escape("foo", "\0-\377"); $str = uri_unescape($safe);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module provides functions to percent-encode and percent-decode
URI strings as defined by RFC 3986. Percent-encoding URI's is informally
called URI escaping. This is the terminology used by this module, which
predates the formalization of the terms by the RFC by several years.</p>
<p>A URI consists of a restricted set of characters. The restricted set
of characters consists of digits, letters, and a few graphic symbols
chosen from those common to most of the character encodings and input
facilities available to Internet users. They are made up of the
unreserved and reserved character sets as defined in RFC 3986.</p>
<p>unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" reserved = ":" /
"/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@" "!" / "$" / "&amp;" / "" / "(" / ")" /
"*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="</p>
<p>In addition, any byte (octet) can be represented in a URI by an
escape sequence: a triplet consisting of the character % followed by two
hexadecimal digits. A byte can also be represented directly by a
character, using the US-ASCII character for that octet.</p>
<p>Some of the characters are <em>reserved</em> for use as delimiters or
as part of certain URI components. These must be escaped if they are to
be treated as ordinary data. Read RFC 3986 for further details.</p>
<p>The functions provided (and exported by default) from this module
are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>uri_escape( $string )</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>uri_escape( $string, $unsafe )</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Replaces each unsafe character in the <code>$string</code> with the
corresponding escape sequence and returns the result. The
<code>$string</code> argument should be a string of bytes. The
<strong>uri_escape()</strong> function will croak if given a characters
with code above 255. Use <strong>uri_escape_utf8()</strong> if you know
you have such chars or/and want chars in the 128 .. 255 range treated as
UTF-8. The <strong>uri_escape()</strong> function takes an optional
second argument that overrides the set of characters that are to be
escaped. The set is specified as a string that can be used in a regular
expression character class (between [ ]). E.g.: "\x00-\x1f\x7f-\xff" #
all control and hi-bit characters "a-z" # all lower case characters
"^A-Za-z" # everything not a letter The default set of characters to be
escaped is all those which are <em>not</em> part of the
<code>unreserved</code> character class shown above as well as the
reserved characters. I.e. the default is: "^A-Za-z0-9\-\._~" The second
argument can also be specified as a regular expression object:
qr/[^A-Za-z]/ Any strings matched by this regular expression will have
all of their characters escaped.</p>
<dl>
<dt>uri_escape_utf8( $string )</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>uri_escape_utf8( $string, $unsafe )</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Works like <strong>uri_escape()</strong>, but will encode chars as
UTF-8 before escaping them. This makes this function able to deal with
characters with code above 255 in <code>$string</code>. Note that chars
in the 128 .. 255 range will be escaped differently by this function
compared to what <strong>uri_escape()</strong> would. For chars in the 0
.. 127 range there is no difference. Equivalent to:
utf8::encode($string); my $uri = uri_escape($string); Note: JavaScript
has a function called <strong>escape()</strong> that produces the
sequence %uXXXX for chars in the 256 .. 65535 range. This function has
really nothing to do with URI escaping but some folks got confused since
it does the right thing in the 0 .. 255 range. Because of this you
sometimes see URIs with these kind of escapes. The JavaScript
<strong>encodeURIComponent()</strong> function is similar to
<strong>uri_escape_utf8()</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>uri_unescape($string,...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a string with each <code>%XX</code> sequence replaced with
the actual byte (octet). This does the same as: $string =~
s/%([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})/chr(hex($1))/eg; but does not modify the string
in-place as this RE would. Using the <strong>uri_unescape()</strong>
function instead of the RE might make the code look cleaner and is a few
characters less to type. In a simple benchmark test I did, calling the
function (instead of the inline RE above) if a few chars were unescaped
was something like 40% slower, and something like 700% slower if none
were. If you are going to unescape a lot of times it might be a good
idea to inline the RE. If the <strong>uri_unescape()</strong> function
is passed multiple strings, then each one is returned unescaped.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The module can also export the <code>%escapes</code> hash, which
contains the mapping from all 256 bytes to the corresponding escape
codes. Lookup in this hash is faster than evaluating
<code>sprintf("%%%02X", ord($byte))</code> each time.</p>
