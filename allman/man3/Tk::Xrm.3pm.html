<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Xrm - X Resource/Defaults/Options routines that obey the
rules.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk; use Tk::Xrm;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Using this modules causes Tk's Option code to be replaced by versions
which use routines from &lt;X11/Xresource.h&gt; - i.e. same ones every
other X toolkit uses.</p>
<p>Result is that matching of name/Class with the options database
follows the same rules as other X toolkits. This makes it more
predictable, and makes it easier to have a single ~/.Xdefaults file
which gives sensible results for both Tk and (say) Motif
applications.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Currently <strong>optionAdd</strong>(<em>key</em> =&gt;
<em>value</em>?, <em>priority</em>?) ignores optional priority
completely and just does <strong>XrmPutStringResource()</strong>.
Perhaps it should be more subtle and do
<strong>XrmMergeDatabases()</strong> or
<strong>XrmCombineDatabase()</strong>.</p>
<p>This version is a little slower than Tk's re-invention but there is
more optimization that can be done.</p>
