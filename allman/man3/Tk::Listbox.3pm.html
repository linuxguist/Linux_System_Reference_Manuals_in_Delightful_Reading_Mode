<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Listbox</strong> method creates a new window (given by
the <code>$widget</code> argument) and makes it into a listbox widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the listbox such
as its colors, font, text, and relief. The <strong>listbox</strong>
command returns its <code>$widget</code> argument. At the time this
command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
<code>$widget</code>, but <code>$widget</code>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A listbox is a widget that displays a list of strings, one per line.
When first created, a new listbox has no elements. Elements may be added
or deleted using methods described below. In addition, one or more
elements may be selected as described below. If a listbox is exporting
its selection (see <strong>exportSelection</strong> option), then it
will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.
Listbox selections are available as type <strong>STRING</strong>; the
value of the selection will be the text of the selected elements, with
newlines separating the elements.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for all the elements to be displayed in the
listbox window at once; commands described below may be used to change
the view in the window. Listboxes allow scrolling in both directions
using the standard <strong>xScrollCommand</strong> and
<strong>yScrollCommand</strong> options. They also support scanning, as
described below.</p>
<h1>INDICES</h1>
<p>Many of the methods for listboxes take one or more indices as
arguments. An index specifies a particular element of the listbox, in
any of the following ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the element as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to
the first element in the listbox.</p>
</dd>
<dt>active</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the element that has the location cursor. This element will
be displayed with an underline when the listbox has the keyboard focus,
and it is specified with the <strong>activate</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>anchor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
<strong>selection anchor</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>end</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the end of the listbox. For most commands this refers to
the last element in the listbox, but for a few commands such as
<strong>index</strong> and <strong>insert</strong> it refers to the
element just after the last one.</p>
</dd>
<dt>@x,y</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the element that covers the point in the listbox window
specified by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (in pixel coordinates). If no
element covers that point, then the closest element to that point is
used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the method descriptions below, arguments named <em>index</em>,
<em>first</em>, and <em>last</em> always contain text indices in one of
the above forms.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Listbox</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for listbox
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;activate(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the active element to the one indicated by <em>index</em>. If
<em>index</em> is outside the range of elements in the listbox then the
closest element is activated. The active element is drawn with an
underline when the widget has the input focus, and its index may be
retrieved with the index <strong>active</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;bbox(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
text in the element given by <em>index</em>. The first two elements of
the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the
screen area covered by the text (specified in pixels relative to the
widget) and the last two elements give the width and height of the area,
in pixels. If no part of the element given by <em>index</em> is visible
on the screen, or if <em>index</em> refers to a non-existent element,
then the result is an empty string; if the element is partially visible,
the result gives the full area of the element, including any parts that
are not visible.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;curselection</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing the numerical indices of all of the
elements in the listbox that are currently selected. If there are no
elements selected in the listbox then an empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;delete(first, ?last?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deletes one or more elements of the listbox. <em>First</em> and
<em>last</em> are indices specifying the first and last elements in the
range to delete. If <em>last</em> isn't specified it defaults to
<em>first</em>, i.e. a single element is deleted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;get(first, ?last?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>last</em> is omitted, returns the contents of the listbox
element indicated by <em>first</em>, or an empty string if
<em>first</em> refers to a non-existent element. If <em>last</em> is
specified, the command returns a list whose elements are all of the
listbox elements between <em>first</em> and <em>last</em>, inclusive.
Both <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> may have any of the standard forms
for indices.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;index(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the integer index value that corresponds to <em>index</em>.
If <em>index</em> is <strong>end</strong> the return value is a count of
the number of elements in the listbox (not the index of the last
element).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;insert(index, ?element, element, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Inserts zero or more new elements in the list just before the element
given by <em>index</em>. If <em>index</em> is specified as
<strong>end</strong> then the new elements are added to the end of the
list. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;itemcget(index, option)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the item configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. Option may have any of the values accepted by the
listbox <strong>itemconfigure</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;itemconfigure(index, ?option, value, option, value,
...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of an item in the listbox.
If no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for the item (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on
the format of this list). If option is specified with no value, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified,
then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given
value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string. The
following options are currently supported for items:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-background =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Color</em> specifies the background color to use when displaying
the item. It may have any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetColor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-foreground =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Color</em> specifies the foreground color to use when displaying
the item. It may have any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetColor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-selectbackground =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Color</em> specifies the background color to use when displaying
the item while it is selected. It may have any of the forms accepted by
Tk_GetColor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-selectforeground =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Color</em> specifies the foreground color to use when displaying
the item while it is selected. It may have any of the forms accepted by
Tk_GetColor.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;nearest(y)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given a y-coordinate within the listbox window, this command returns
the index of the (visible) listbox element nearest to that
y-coordinate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;scan(option, args)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to implement scanning on listboxes. It has two
forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;scanMark(x, y)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Records <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> and the current view in the listbox
window; used in conjunction with later <strong>scan dragto</strong>
commands. Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press
in the widget. It returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;scanDragto(x, y.)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command computes the difference between its <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> arguments and the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> arguments to the
last <strong>scan mark</strong> command for the widget. It then adjusts
the view by 10 times the difference in coordinates. This command is
typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
the effect of dragging the list at high speed through the window. The
return value is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;see(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjust the view in the listbox so that the element given by
<em>index</em> is visible. If the element is already visible then the
command has no effect; if the element is near one edge of the window
then the listbox scrolls to bring the element into view at the edge;
otherwise the listbox scrolls to center the element.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;selection(option, arg)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to adjust the selection within a listbox. It has
several forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;selectionAnchor(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the selection anchor to the element given by <em>index</em>. If
<em>index</em> refers to a non-existent element, then the closest
element is used. The selection anchor is the end of the selection that
is fixed while dragging out a selection with the mouse. The index
<strong>anchor</strong> may be used to refer to the anchor element.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;selectionClear(first, ?last?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If any of the elements between <em>first</em> and <em>last</em>
(inclusive) are selected, they are deselected. The selection state is
not changed for elements outside this range.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;selectionIncludes(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if the element indicated by <em>index</em> is currently
selected, 0 if it isn't.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;selectionSet(first, ?last?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects all of the elements in the range between <em>first</em> and
<em>last</em>, inclusive, without affecting the selection state of
elements outside that range.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;size</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string indicating the total number of elements in
the listbox.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;xview(args)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
the information in the widget's window. It can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;xview</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal span
that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2
and the second element is .6, 20% of the listbox's text is off-screen to
the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text
is off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to
scrollbars via the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;xview(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character position given
by <em>index</em> is displayed at the left edge of the window. Character
positions are defined by the width of the character
<strong>0</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;xviewMoveto( fraction );</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>fraction</em> of the total
width of the listbox text is off-screen to the left. <em>fraction</em>
must be a fraction between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;xviewScroll( number, what );</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right
by <em>number</em> character units (the width of the <strong>0</strong>
character) on the display; if it is <strong>pages</strong> then the view
adjusts by <em>number</em> screenfuls. If <em>number</em> is negative
then characters farther to the left become visible; if it is positive
then characters farther to the right become visible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;yview(?args?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the
text in the widget's window. It can take any of the following forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;yview</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real
fractions between 0 and 1. The first element gives the position of the
listbox element at the top of the window, relative to the listbox as a
whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the listbox, for example). The
second element gives the position of the listbox element just after the
last one in the window, relative to the listbox as a whole. These are
the same values passed to scrollbars via the
<strong>-yscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;yview(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by
<em>index</em> is displayed at the top of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;yviewMoveto( fraction );</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by
<em>fraction</em> appears at the top of the window. <em>Fraction</em> is
a fraction between 0 and 1; 0 indicates the first element in the
listbox, 0.33 indicates the element one-third the way through the
listbox, and so on.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$listbox-&gt;yviewScroll( number, what );</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command adjusts the view in the window up or down according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong>. If <em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the
view adjusts up or down by <em>number</em> lines; if it is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by <em>number</em>
screenfuls. If <em>number</em> is negative then earlier elements become
visible; if it is positive then later elements become visible.</p>
</dd>

<h1>DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for listboxes that give them
Motif-like behavior. Much of the behavior of a listbox is determined by
its <strong>selectMode</strong> option, which selects one of four ways
of dealing with the selection.</p>
<p>If the selection mode is <strong>single</strong> or
<strong>browse</strong>, at most one element can be selected in the
listbox at once. In both modes, clicking button 1 on an element selects
it and deselects any other selected item. In <strong>browse</strong>
mode it is also possible to drag the selection with button 1.</p>
<p>If the selection mode is <strong>multiple</strong> or
<strong>extended</strong>, any number of elements may be selected at
once, including discontiguous ranges. In <strong>multiple</strong> mode,
clicking button 1 on an element toggles its selection state without
affecting any other elements. In <strong>extended</strong> mode,
pressing button 1 on an element selects it, deselects everything else,
and sets the anchor to the element under the mouse; dragging the mouse
with button 1 down extends the selection to include all the elements
between the anchor and the element under the mouse, inclusive.</p>
<p>Most people will probably want to use <strong>browse</strong> mode
for single selections and <strong>extended</strong> mode for multiple
selections; the other modes appear to be useful only in special
situations.</p>
<p>Any time the selection changes in the listbox, the virtual event
<strong>&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;</strong> will be generated. It is
easiest to bind to this event to be made aware of any changes to listbox
selection.</p>
<p>In addition to the above behavior, the following additional behavior
is defined by the default bindings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, the selected range can be adjusted
by pressing button 1 with the Shift key down: this modifies the
selection to consist of the elements between the anchor and the element
under the mouse, inclusive. The un-anchored end of this new selection
can also be dragged with the button down.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, pressing button 1 with the Control
key down starts a toggle operation: the anchor is set to the element
under the mouse, and its selection state is reversed. The selection
state of other elements isn't changed. If the mouse is dragged with
button 1 down, then the selection state of all elements between the
anchor and the element under the mouse is set to match that of the
anchor element; the selection state of all other elements remains what
it was before the toggle operation began.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the mouse leaves the listbox window with button 1 down, the window
scrolls away from the mouse, making information visible that used to be
off-screen on the side of the mouse. The scrolling continues until the
mouse re-enters the window, the button is released, or the end of the
listbox is reached.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning. If it is pressed and dragged
over the listbox, the contents of the listbox drag at high speed in the
direction the mouse moves.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Up or Down key is pressed, the location cursor (active
element) moves up or down one element. If the selection mode is
<strong>browse</strong> or <strong>extended</strong> then the new active
element is also selected and all other elements are deselected. In
<strong>extended</strong> mode the new active element becomes the
selection anchor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the
location cursor (active element) up or down one element and also extend
the selection to that element in a fashion similar to dragging with
mouse button 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Left and Right keys scroll the listbox view left and right by the
width of the character <strong>0</strong>. Control-Left and
Control-Right scroll the listbox view left and right by the width of the
window. Control-Prior and Control-Next also scroll left and right by the
width of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[8]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Prior and Next keys scroll the listbox view up and down by one
page (the height of the window).</p>
</dd>
<dt>[9]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Home and End keys scroll the listbox horizontally to the left and
right edges, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[10]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-Home sets the location cursor to the the first element in the
listbox, selects that element, and deselects everything else in the
listbox.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[11]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-End sets the location cursor to the the last element in the
listbox, selects that element, and deselects everything else in the
listbox.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[12]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the
selection to the first element in the listbox and Control-Shift-End
extends the selection to the last element.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[13]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In <strong>multiple</strong> mode, Control-Shift-Home moves the
location cursor to the first element in the listbox and
Control-Shift-End moves the location cursor to the last element.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[14]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor
(active element) just as if mouse button 1 had been pressed over this
element.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[15]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Control-Shift-space and
Shift-Select extend the selection to the active element just as if
button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[16]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, the Escape key cancels the most
recent selection and restores all the elements in the selected range to
their previous selection state.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[17]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-slash selects everything in the widget, except in
<strong>single</strong> and <strong>browse</strong> modes, in which case
it selects the active element and deselects everything else.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[18]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-backslash deselects everything in the widget, except in
<strong>browse</strong> mode where it has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[19]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies
the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.
The behavior of listboxes can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>TIED INTERFACE</h1>
<p>The Tk::Listbox widget can also be tied to a scalar or array
variable, with different behaviour depending on the variable type, with
the following tie commands:</p>
<p>use Tk; my ( @array, $scalar, $other ); my %options = ( ReturnType
=&gt; "index" ); my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new(); my $lbox =
$MW-&gt;Listbox()-&gt;pack(); my @list = ( "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"
); $lbox-&gt;insert(end, @list ); tie @array, "Tk::Listbox", $lbox tie
$scalar, "Tk::Listbox", $lbox; tie $other, "Tk::Listbox", $lbox,
%options;</p>
<p>currently only one modifier is implemented, a 3 way flag for tied
scalars ReturnType which can have values element, index or both. The
default is element.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tied Arrays</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you tie an array to the Listbox you can manipulate the items
currently contained by the box in the same manner as a normal array,
e.g. print @array; push(@array, @list); my $popped = pop(@array); my
$shifted = shift(@array); unshift(@array, @list); delete $array[$index];
print $string if exists $array[$i]; @array = (); splice @array, $offset,
$length, @list The delete function is implemented slightly differently
from the standard array implementation. Instead of setting the element
at that index to undef it instead physically removes it from the
Listbox. This has the effect of changing the array indices, so for
instance if you had a list on non-continuous indices you wish to remove
from the Listbox you should reverse sort the list and then apply the
delete function, e.g. my @list = ( 1, 2, 4, 12, 20 ); my @remove =
reverse sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @list; delete @array[@remove]; would
safely remove indices 20, 12, 4, 2 and 1 from the Listbox without
problems. It should also be noted that a similar warning applies to the
splice function (which would normally be used in this context to perform
the same job).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tied Scalars</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unlike tied arrays, if you tie a scalar to the Listbox you can
retrieve the currently selected elements in the box as an array
referenced by the scalar, for instance my @list = ( "a", "b", "c", "d",
"e", "f" ); $lbox-&gt;insert(end, sort @list );
$lbox-&gt;selectionSet(1); inserts <code>@list</code> as elements in an
already existing listbox and selects the element at index 1, which is b.
If we then print @$selected; this will return the currently selected
elements, in this case b. However, if the ReturnType argument is passed
when tying the Listbox to the scalar with value index then the indices
of the selected elements will be returned instead of the elements
themselves, ie in this case 1. This can be useful when manipulating both
contents and selected elements in the Listbox at the same time.
Importantly, if a value both is given the scalar will not be tied to an
array, but instead to a hash, with keys being the indices and values
being the elements at those indices You can also manipulate the selected
items using the scalar. Equating the scalar to an array reference will
select any elements that match elements in the Listbox, non-matching
array items are ignored, e.g. my @list = ( "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"
); $lbox-&gt;insert(end, sort @list ); $lbox-&gt;selectionSet(1); would
insert the array <code>@list</code> into an already existing Listbox and
select element at index 1, i.e. b @array = ( "a", "b", "f" ); $selected
= \@array; would select elements a, b and f in the Listbox. Again, if
the index we indicate we want to use indices in the options hash then
the indices are use instead of elements, e.g. @array = ( 0, 1, 5 );
$selected = \@array; would have the same effect, selecting elements a, b
and f if the <code>$selected</code> variable was tied with
<code>%options</code> = ( ReturnType =&gt; index ). If we are returning
both, i.e. the tied scalar points to a hash, both key and value must
match, e.g. %hash = ( 0 =&gt; "a", 1 =&gt; "b", 5 =&gt; "f" ); $selected
= \%hash; would have the same effect as the previous examples. It should
be noted that, despite being a reference to an array (or possibly a
has), you still can not copy the tied variable without it being untied,
instead you must pass a reference to the tied scalar between
subroutines.</p>
