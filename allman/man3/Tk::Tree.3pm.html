<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Tree - Create and manipulate Tree widgets</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>    <strong>use Tk::Tree;</strong></p>
<p>    <em><code>$tree</code></em> =
<em><code>$parent</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Tree</strong>(?<em>options</em>?);</p>
<h1>SUPER-CLASS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tree</strong> class is derived from the HList class and
inherits all the methods, options and subwidgets of its super-class. A
<strong>Tree</strong> widget is not scrolled by default.</p>
<h1>STANDARD OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>Tree</strong> supports all the standard options of an HList
widget. See Tk::options for details on the standard options.</p>
<h1>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Name: browseCmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: BrowseCmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -browsecmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a callback to call whenever the user browses on an entry
(usually by single-clicking on the entry). The callback is called with
one argument, the pathname of the entry.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: closeCmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: CloseCmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -closecmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a callback to call whenever an entry needs to be closed
(See BINDINGS below). This method is called with one argument, the
pathname of the entry. This method should perform appropriate actions to
close the specified entry. If the <strong>-closecmd</strong> option is
not specified, the default closing action is to hide all child entries
of the specified entry.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: command</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Command</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -command</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a callback to call whenever the user activates an entry
(usually by double-clicking on the entry). The callback is called with
one argument, the pathname of the entry.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: ignoreInvoke</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: IgnoreInvoke</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -ignoreinvoke</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>A Boolean value that specifies when a branch should be opened or
closed. A branch will always be opened or closed when the user presses
the (+) and (-) indicators. However, when the user invokes a branch (by
doublc-clicking or pressing &lt;Return&gt;), the branch will be opened
or closed only if <strong>-ignoreinvoke</strong> is set to false (the
default setting).</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: openCmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: OpenCmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -opencmd</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a callback to call whenever an entry needs to be opened
(See BINDINGS below). This method is called with one argument, the
pathname of the entry. This method should perform appropriate actions to
open the specified entry. If the <strong>-opencmd</strong> option is not
specified, the default opening action is to show all the child entries
of the specified entry.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tree</strong> method creates a new window and makes it
into a Tree widget and return a reference to it. Additional options,
described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
database to configure aspects of the Tree widget such as its cursor and
relief.</p>
<p>The Tree widget can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree
form. The user can adjust the view of the tree by opening or closing
parts of the tree.</p>
<p>To display a static tree structure, you can add the entries into the
Tree widget and hide any entries as desired. Then you can call the
<strong>autosetmode</strong> method. This will set up the Tree widget so
that it handles all the <em>open</em> and <em>close</em> events
automatically. the demonstration program
<em>Tixish/examples/perl-tix-tree</em>).</p>
<p>The above method is not applicable if you want to maintain a dynamic
tree structure, i.e, you do not know all the entries in the tree and you
need to add or delete entries subsequently. To do this, you should first
create the entries in the Tree widget. Then, use the
<strong>setmode</strong> method to indicate the entries that can be
opened or closed, and use the <strong>-opencmd</strong> and
<strong>-closecmd</strong> options to handle the opening and closing
events. (Please see the demonstration program
<em>Tixish/examples/perl-tix-dyntree</em>).</p>
<p>Use either</p>
<p>    <em><code>$parent</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Scrolled</strong>(<strong>'Tree'</strong>,
... );</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>    <em><code>$parent</code></em>-&gt;<strong>ScrlTree</strong>( ...
);</p>
<p>to create a scrolled <strong>Tree</strong>. See Tk::Scrolled for
details.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tree</strong> method creates a widget object. This object
supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for Tree widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$tree-&gt;add_pathimage(treeRegExp [, openImg, closeImg])</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method defines images for a given path (images must be in xpm
format). The path can be determined by a simplified regular expression.
There are just three metasymbols:</p>
<dl>
<dt>^</dt>
<dd>
<p>at the beginning of the <code>treeRegExp</code> same as in Perl
regular expressions</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><p>anything</p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>$</dt>
<dd>
<p>at the end of the <code>TreeRegExp</code>, the same as in Perl
regular expressions</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Examples: $tree-&gt;add_pathimage(^root,openfolder,folder); matches
<code>root</code>, <code>root.foo</code>, <code>root.bar</code>, but not
<code>foo.root</code>
$tree-&gt;add_pathimage(root.*.class,openfolder,folder); matches all
paths containing <code>root.&lt;anything&gt;.class</code>, but not
<code>root.&lt;anything&gt;.&lt;anything&gt;.class</code> <code>*</code>
is one part of the path. If you want to use a wildcard for two steps,
you have to use <code>*.*</code>.
$tree-&gt;add_pathimage(class$,openfolder,folder); This matches all path
with <code>class</code> at the end.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$tree-&gt;autosetmode</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method calls the <strong>setmode</strong> method for all the
entries in this Tree widget: if an entry has no child entries, its mode
is set to <strong>none</strong>. Otherwise, if the entry has any hidden
child entries, its mode is set to <strong>open</strong>; otherwise its
mode is set to <strong>close</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$tree-&gt;child_entries([$path][,$depth])</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns in list context an array that contains all
pathnames of subentries within the given path. In scalar context it
returns the number of subentries in the given path. Example: root | foo
| bar | | bar1 | | bar2 my @childentries =
$tree-&gt;child_entries(root.bar); # returns (root.bar.bar1,
root.bar.bar2) my $nr_of_subentries = $tree-&gt;child_entries(root,2); #
returns 4 If <code>$path</code> is omitted, all it is assumed, that the
entry above 'root' is meant. <code>$depth</code> defines the numbers of
levels.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$tree-&gt;close(entryPath)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Close the entry given by <em>entryPath</em> if its <em>mode</em> is
<strong>close</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$tree-&gt;getmode(entryPath)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current <em>mode</em> of the entry given by
<em>entryPath</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$tree-&gt;open(entryPath)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the entry given by <em>entryPath</em> if its <em>mode</em> is
<strong>open</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$tree-&gt;setmode(entryPath, mode)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is used to indicate whether the entry given by
<em>entryPath</em> has children entries and whether the children are
visible. <em>mode</em> must be one of <strong>open</strong>,
<strong>close</strong> or <strong>none</strong>. If <em>mode</em> is set
to <strong>open</strong>, a (+) indicator is drawn next to the entry. If
<em>mode</em> is set to <strong>close</strong>, a (-) indicator is drawn
next to the entry. If <em>mode</em> is set to <strong>none</strong>, no
indicators will be drawn for this entry. The default <em>mode</em> is
none. The <strong>open</strong> mode indicates the entry has hidden
children and this entry can be opened by the user. The
<strong>close</strong> mode indicates that all the children of the entry
are now visible and the entry can be closed by the user.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BINDINGS</h1>
<p>The basic mouse and keyboard bindings of the Tree widget are the same
as the bindings of the HList widget. In addition, the entries can be
opened or closed under the following conditions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the <em>mode</em> of the entry is <strong>open</strong>, it can be
opened by clicking on its (+) indicator.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the <em>mode</em> of the entry is <strong>close</strong>, it can
be closed by clicking on its (-) indicator.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
