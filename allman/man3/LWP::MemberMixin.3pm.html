<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>LWP::MemberMixin - Member access mixin class</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>package Foo; use parent qw(LWP::MemberMixin);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A mixin class to get methods that provide easy access to member
variables in the <code>%$self</code>. Ideally there should be better
Perl language support for this.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>There is only one method provided:</p>
<h2>_elem</h2>
<p>_elem($elem [, $val])</p>
<p>Internal method to get/set the value of member variable
<code>$elem</code>. If <code>$val</code> is present it is used as the
new value for the member variable. If it is not present the current
value is not touched. In both cases the previous value of the member
variable is returned.</p>
