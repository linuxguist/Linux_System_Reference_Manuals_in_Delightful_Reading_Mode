<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Balloon - pop up help balloons.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk::Balloon; ... $b = $top-&gt;Balloon(-statusbar =&gt;
$status_bar_widget); # Normal Balloon: $b-&gt;attach($widget,
-balloonmsg =&gt; "Balloon help message", -statusmsg =&gt; "Status bar
message"); # Balloon attached to entries in a menu widget:
$b-&gt;attach($menu, -state =&gt; status, -msg =&gt; [first menu entry,
second menu entry, ... ], ); # Balloon attached to individual items in a
canvas widget: $b-&gt;attach($canvas, -balloonposition =&gt; mouse, -msg
=&gt; {item1 =&gt; msg1, tag2 =&gt; msg2, ... }, ); # Balloon attached
to items in a listbox widget: $b-&gt;attach($listbox, -balloonposition
=&gt; mouse, -msg =&gt; [first listbox element, 2nd listbox element, ...
], );</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Balloon</strong> provides the framework to create and attach
help balloons to various widgets so that when the mouse pauses over the
widget for more than a specified amount of time, a help balloon is
popped up.</p>
<h2>Balloons and Menus or Listboxes</h2>
<p>If the balloon is attached to a <strong>Menu</strong> or
<strong>Listbox</strong> widget and the message arguments are array
references, then each element in the array will be the message
corresponding to a menu entry or listbox element. The balloon message
will then be shown for the entry which the mouse pauses over. Otherwise
it is assumed that the balloon is to be attached to the
<strong>Menu</strong> or <strong>Listbox</strong> as a whole. You can
have separate status and balloon messages just like normal balloons.</p>
<h2>Balloons and Canvases</h2>
<p>If the balloon is attached to a <strong>Canvas</strong> widget and
the message arguments are hash references, then each hash key should
correspond to a canvas item ID or tag and the associated value will
correspond to the message for that canvas item. The balloon message will
then be shown for the current item (the one at the position of the
mouse). Otherwise it is assumed that the balloon is to be attached to
the <strong>Canvas</strong> as a whole. You can have separate status and
balloon messages just like normal balloons.</p>
<h2>Balloons and HLists</h2>
<p>If the balloon is attached to a <strong>HList</strong> widget and the
message arguments are hash references, then each hash key should
correspond to a HList path and the associated value will correspond to
the message for that HList item. The balloon message will then be shown
for the current item (the one at the position of the mouse). Otherwise
it is assumed that the balloon is to be attached to the
<strong>HList</strong> as a whole. You can have separate status and
balloon messages just like normal balloons.</p>
<h2>Balloon Position</h2>
<p>By default, the balloon pops up at the lower right side of the
client. If it would extend outside the lower screen border, it's
positioned at the upper right side. If it would extend outside the right
screen border it's shown on the lower left side of the client. If it
would extend outside both the lower and the right screen border, it's
positioned at the upper left side of the client. Thus, the little arrow
always points to the attached client.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>Balloon</strong> accepts all of the options that the
<strong>Frame</strong> widget accepts. In addition, the following
options are also recognized.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-initwait</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the amount of time to wait without activity before popping
up a help balloon. Specified in milliseconds. Defaults to 350
milliseconds. This applies to both the popped up balloon and the status
bar message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-state</dt>
<dd>
<p>Can be one of <strong>'balloon'</strong>, <strong>'status'</strong>,
<strong>'both'</strong> or <strong>'none'</strong> indicating that the
help balloon, status bar help, both or none respectively should be
activated when the mouse pauses over the client widget. Default is
<strong>'both'</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-statusbar</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the widget used to display the status message. This widget
should accept the <strong>-text</strong> option and is typically a
<strong>Label</strong>. If the widget accepts the
<strong>-textvariable</strong> option and that option is defined then it
is used instead of the <strong>-text</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-balloonposition</dt>
<dd>
<p>Can be one of <strong>'widget'</strong> or <strong>'mouse'</strong>.
It controls where the balloon will popup. <strong>'widget'</strong>
makes the balloon appear at the lower right corner of the widget it is
attached to (default), and <strong>'mouse'</strong> makes the balloon
appear below and to the right of the current mouse position.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-postcommand</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option takes a <strong>CODE</strong> reference which will be
executed before the balloon and statusbar messages are displayed and
should return a true or false value to indicate whether you want the
balloon to be displayed or not. This also lets you control where the
balloon is positioned by returning a true value that looks like
<em>X,Y</em> (matches this regular expression:
<code>/^(\d+),(\d+)$/</code>). If the postcommand returns a value that
matches that re then those coordinates will be used as the position to
post the balloon. <em>Warning:</em> this subroutine should return
quickly or the balloon response will appear slow.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-cancelcommand</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option takes a <strong>CODE</strong> reference which will be
executed before the balloon and statusbar messages are canceled and
should return a true or false value to indicate whether you want the
balloon to be canceled or not. <em>Warning:</em> this subroutine should
return quickly or the balloon response will appear slow.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-motioncommand</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option takes a <strong>CODE</strong> reference which will be
executed for any motion event and should return a true or false value to
indicate whether the currently displayed balloon should be canceled
(deactivated). If it returns true then the balloon will definitely be
canceled, if it returns false then it may still be canceled depending
the internal rules. <em>Note:</em> a new balloon may be posted after the
<strong>-initwait</strong> time interval, use the
<strong>-postcommand</strong> option to control that behavior.
<em>Warning:</em> the subroutine should be extremely fast or the balloon
response will appear slow and consume a lot of CPU time (it is executed
every time the mouse moves over the widgets the balloon is attached
to).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-numscreens</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option accepts an integer 1 or greater. This option should be
used to avoid disjointed balloons across multiple screens in single
logical sceen (SLS) mode. This only currently works in the horizontal
direction. Example: If you are running dual screens in SLS mode then you
would set this value to 2. Default value is 1.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Balloon</strong> widget supports only three non-standard
methods:</p>
<h2><strong>attach(</strong><em>widget</em>,
<em>options</em><strong>)</strong></h2>
<p>Attaches the widget indicated by <em>widget</em> to the help system.
The allowed options are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-statusmsg</dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument is the message to be shown on the status bar when the
mouse pauses over this client. If this is not specified, but
<strong>-msg</strong> is specified then the message displayed on the
status bar is the same as the argument for <strong>-msg</strong>. If you
give it a scalar reference then it is dereferenced before being
displayed. Useful if the postcommand is used to change the message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-balloonmsg</dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument is the message to be displayed in the balloon that will
be popped up when the mouse pauses over this client. As with
<strong>-statusmsg</strong> if this is not specified, then it takes its
value from the <strong>-msg</strong> specification if any. If neither
<strong>-balloonmsg</strong> nor <strong>-msg</strong> are specified, or
they are the empty string then no balloon is popped up instead of an
empty balloon. If you give it a scalar reference then it is dereferenced
before being displayed. Useful if the postcommand is used to change the
message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-msg</dt>
<dd>
<p>The catch-all for <strong>-statusmsg</strong> and
<strong>-balloonmsg</strong>. This is a convenient way of specifying the
same message to be displayed in both the balloon and the status bar for
the client.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-initwait</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-state</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-statusbar</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-balloonposition</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-postcommand</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-cancelcommand</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-motioncommand</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>These options allow you to override the balloon's default value for
those option for some of the widgets it is attached to. It accepts the
same values as above and will default to the <strong>Balloon</strong>'s
value.</p>
<h2><strong>detach(</strong><em>widget</em><strong>)</strong></h2>
<p>Detaches the specified <em>widget</em> from the help system.</p>
<h2><strong>destroy</strong></h2>
<p>Destroys the specified balloon.</p>
<h1>ADVERTISED SUBWIDGETS</h1>
<p>The balloon label is advertised as <code>message</code>.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>See the balloon demo included with the widget demo script that came
with the distribution for examples on various ways to use balloons.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Because of the overhead associated with each balloon you create (from
tracking the mouse movement to know when to activate and deactivate
them) you will see the best performance (low CPU consumption) if you
create as few balloons as possible and attach them to as many widgets as
you can. In other words, don't create a balloon for each widget you want
to attach one to.</p>
<h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>Pressing any button will deactivate (cancel) the current balloon, if
one exists. You can usually make the balloon reappear by moving the
mouse a little. Creative use of the 3 command options can help you out
also. If the mouse is over the balloon when a menu is unposted then the
balloon will remain until you move off of it.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>If using balloons attached to listbox entries or canvas items in a
scrolled widget, then the subwidget have to be used:</p>
<p>$balloon-&gt;attach($w-&gt;Subwidget("scrolled"), -msg =&gt;
...);</p>
