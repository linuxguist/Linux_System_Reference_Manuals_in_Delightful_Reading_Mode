<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>IO::AtomicFile - write a file which is updated atomically</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use IO::AtomicFile; ### Write a temp file, and have it install itself
when closed: my $FH = IO::AtomicFile-&gt;open("bar.dat", "w"); print $FH
"Hello!\n"; $FH-&gt;close || die "couldnt install atomic file: $!"; ###
Write a temp file, but delete it before it gets installed: my $FH =
IO::AtomicFile-&gt;open("bar.dat", "w"); print $FH "Hello!\n";
$FH-&gt;delete; ### Write a temp file, but neither install it nor delete
it: my $FH = IO::AtomicFile-&gt;open("bar.dat", "w"); print $FH
"Hello!\n"; $FH-&gt;detach;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module is intended for people who need to update files reliably
in the face of unexpected program termination.</p>
<p>For example, you generally don't want to be halfway in the middle of
writing <em>/etc/passwd</em> and have your program terminate! Even the
act of writing a single scalar to a filehandle is <em>not</em>
atomic.</p>
<p>But this module gives you true atomic updates, via
<strong>rename()</strong>. When you open a file <em>/foo/bar.dat</em>
via this module, you are <em>actually</em> opening a temporary file
<em>/foo/bar.dat..TMP</em>, and writing your output there. The act of
closing this file (either explicitly via <strong>close()</strong>, or
implicitly via the destruction of the object) will cause
<strong>rename()</strong> to be called... therefore, from the point of
view of the outside world, the file's contents are updated in a single
time quantum.</p>
<p>To ensure that problems do not go undetected, the close method done
by the destructor will raise a fatal exception if the
<strong>rename()</strong> fails. The explicit <strong>close()</strong>
just returns undef.</p>
<p>You can also decide at any point to trash the file you've been
building.</p>
