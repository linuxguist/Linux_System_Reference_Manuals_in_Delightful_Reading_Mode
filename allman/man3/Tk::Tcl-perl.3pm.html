<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tcl_vs_perl - very old suspect documentation on porting.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This isn't really a .pod yet, nor is it Tcl vs perl it is a copy of
John's comparison of Malcolm's original perl/Tk port with the current
one. It is also out-of-date in places.</p>
<p>From: john@WPI.EDU (John Stoffel ) Here are some thoughts on the new
Tk extension and how I think the organization of the commands looks.
Mostly, Im happy with it, it makes some things more organized and more
consistent with tcl/tk, but since the overlying language is so
different, I dont think we need to follow exactly the tcl/tk model for
how to call the language. The basic structure of the Tk program is:
require Tk; $top = MainWindow-&gt;new(); # # create widgets #
Tk::MainLoop; sub method1 { } sub methodN { } This is pretty much the
same as tkperl5a5, with some cosmetic naming changes, and some more
useful command name and usage changes. A quick comparison in no
particular order follows: tkperl5a5 Tk -------------------------------
----------------------------------- $top=tkinit(name,display,sync);
$top=MainWindow-&gt;new(); tkpack $w, ... ; $w-&gt;pack(...) $w =
Class::new($top, ...); $w = $top-&gt;Class(...); tkmainloop;
Tk::MainLoop; tkbind($w,"&lt;key&gt;",sub);
$w-&gt;bind("&lt;key&gt;",sub); tkdelete($w, ...); $w-&gt;delete(...);
$w-&gt;scanmark(...); $w-&gt;scan("mark", ...); $w-&gt;scandragto(...);
$w-&gt;scan("dragto", ...); $w-&gt;tkselect(); $w-&gt;Select();
$w-&gt;selectadjust(...); $w-&gt;selection("adjust", ...);
$w-&gt;selectto(...); $w-&gt;selection("to", ...);
$w-&gt;selectfrom(...); $w-&gt;selection("from", ...);
$w-&gt;tkindex(...); $w-&gt;index(...); tclcmd("xxx",...);
&amp;Tk::xxx(...) # all Tk commands, but no Tcl at all tclcmd("winfo",
xxx, $w, ...); $w-&gt;xxx(...); $w-&gt;mark(...); $w-&gt;tag(...);
$w-&gt;grabstatus(); $w-&gt;grab("status"); $w-&gt;grabrelease(...);
$w-&gt;grab("release", ...); focus($w); $w-&gt;focus; update();
Tk-&gt;update(); idletasks(); Tk-&gt;update("idletasks"); wm("cmd",$w,
...); $w-&gt;cmd(...); destroy($w); $w-&gt;destroy(); Tk::option(...);
$w-&gt;OptionGet(name,Class) $w-&gt;place(...) Tk::property(...); $w =
Entry::new($parent,...) is now $w = $parent-&gt;Entry(...) As this
allows new to be inherited from a Window class.
-method=&gt;x,-slave=&gt;y is now -command =&gt; [x,y] 1st element of
list is treated as "method" if y is an object reference. (You can have
-command =&gt; [a,b,c,d,e] too; b..e get passed as args). Object
references are now hashes rather than scalars and there is only ever one
such per window. The Tcl_CmdInfo and PathName are entries in the hash.
(This allows derived classes to re-bless the hash and keep their on
stuff in it too.) Tks "Tcl_Interp" is in fact a ref to "." window. You
can find all the Tk windows descended from it as their object references
get added (by PathName) into this hash. $w-&gt;MainWindow returns this
hash from any window. I think that it should extend to multiple tkinits
/ Tk-&gt;news with different Displays - if Tk code does. Finally "bind"
passes window as "extra" (or only) argument. Thus
Tk::Button-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-Enter&gt;,"Enter"); Binds Enter events to
Tk::Button::Enter by default but gets called as $w-&gt;Enter so derived
class of Button can just define its own Enter method. &amp;EvWref and
associated globals and race conditions are no longer needed. One thing
to beware of : commands bound to events with $widget-&gt;bind follow
same pattern, but get passed extra args :
$widget-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-1&gt;,[sub {print shift}, $one, $two ]); When
sub gets called it has : $widget $one $two passed. 1st extra arg is
reference to the per-widget hash that serves as the perl object for the
widget. Every time an XEvent a reference to a special class is placed in
the widget hash. It can be retrieved by $w-&gt;XEvent method. The
methods of the XEvent class are the Tcl/Tk % special characters. Thus:
$widget-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-KeyPress&gt;, sub { my $w = shift; my $e =
$w-&gt;XEvent; print $w-&gt;PathName," ",$e-&gt;A," pressed
,$e-&gt;xy,"\n"); }); XEvent-&gt;xy is a special case which returns "@"
. $e-&gt;x . "," . $e-&gt;y which is common in Text package. Because of
passing a blessed widget hash to "bound" subs they can be bound to
(possibly inherited) methods of the widgets class:
Class-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-Down&gt;,Down); sub Class::Down { my $w = shift;
# handle down arrow } Also: -command and friends can take a list the 1st
element can be a ref to as sub or a method name. Remaining elements are
passed as args to the sub at "invoke" time. Thus : $b=
$w-&gt;Button(blah blah, -command =&gt; [sub{print shift} , $fred ]);
Should do the trick, provided $fred is defined at time of button
creation. Thus 1st element of list is equivalent to Malcolms -method and
second would be his -slave. Any further elements are a bonus and avoid
having to pass ref to an array/hash as a slave.</p>
