<p>Specifies a Perl/Tk callback to associate with the button. This
command is typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the
button window.</p>

<p>Specifies whether the button should display both an image and text,
and if so, where the image should be placed relative to the text. Valid
values for this option are <strong>bottom</strong>,
<strong>center</strong>, <strong>left</strong>, <strong>none</strong>,
<strong>right</strong> and <strong>top</strong>. The default value is
<strong>none</strong>, meaning that the button will display either an
image or text, depending on the values of the -image and -bitmap
options.</p>

</dl>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the default ring:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>, or
<strong>disabled</strong>. In active state, the button is drawn with the
platform specific appearance for a default button. In normal state, the
button is drawn with the platform specific appearance for a non-default
button, leaving enough space to draw the default button appearance. The
normal and active states will result in buttons of the same size. In
disabled state, the button is drawn with the non-default button
appearance without leaving space for the default appearance. The
disabled state may result in a smaller button than the active state.

<dt>Switch: -height</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a desired height for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units (i.e.
any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for text
it is in lines of text. If this option isn't specified, the button's
desired height is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text
being displayed in it.</p>

</dl>
<p>Specifies an alternative relief for the button, to be used when the
mouse cursor is over the widget. This option can be used to make toolbar
buttons, by configuring <strong>-relief flat -overrelief</strong>
raised. If the value of this option is the empty string, then no
alternative relief is used when the mouse cursor is over the button. The
empty string is the default value.</p>

</dl>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the button:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>, or
<strong>disabled</strong>. In normal state the button is displayed using
the <strong>foreground</strong> and <strong>background</strong> options.
The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the button.
In active state the button is displayed using the
<strong>activeForeground</strong> and <strong>activeBackground</strong>
options. Disabled state means that the button should be insensitive: the
default bindings will refuse to activate the widget and will ignore
mouse button presses. In this state the
<strong>disabledForeground</strong> and <strong>background</strong>
options determine how the button is displayed.</p>

</dl>
<p>Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units (i.e.
any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for text
it is in characters. If this option isn't specified, the button's
desired width is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text
being displayed in it.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Button</strong> method creates a new window (given by the
<code>$widget</code> argument) and makes it into a button widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the button such
as its colors, font, text, and initial relief. The
<strong>button</strong> command returns its <code>$widget</code>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <code>$widget</code>, but <code>$widget</code>'s parent
must exist.</p>
<p>A button is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.
If text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it can occupy
multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping
occurs because of the <strong>-wraplength</strong> option) and one of
the characters may optionally be underlined using the
<strong>-underline</strong> option. It can display itself in either of
three different ways, according to the <strong>-state</strong> option;
it can be made to appear raised, sunken, or flat; and it can be made to
flash. When a user invokes the button (by pressing mouse button 1 with
the cursor over the button), then the perl/Tk callback specified in the
<strong>-command</strong> option is invoked.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Button</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for button
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$button-&gt;flash</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flash the button. This is accomplished by redisplaying the button
several times, alternating between active and normal colors. At the end
of the flash the button is left in the same normal/active state as when
the command was invoked. This command is ignored if the button's state
is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$button-&gt;invoke</dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke the callback associated with the buttons
<strong>-command</strong> option, if there is one. The return value is
the return value from the callback, or the undefined value if there is
no callback associated with the button. This command is ignored if the
button's state is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for buttons that give them
default behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A button activates whenever the mouse passes over it and deactivates
whenever the mouse leaves the button. Under Windows, this binding is
only active when mouse button 1 has been pressed over the button.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A button's relief is changed to sunken whenever mouse button 1 is
pressed over the button, and the relief is restored to its original
value when button 1 is later released.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If mouse button 1 is pressed over a button and later released over
the button, the button is invoked. However, if the mouse is not over the
button when button 1 is released, then no invocation occurs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When a button has the input focus, the space key causes the button to
be invoked. If the button's state is <strong>disabled</strong> then none
of the above actions occur: the button is completely non-responsive. The
behavior of buttons can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
