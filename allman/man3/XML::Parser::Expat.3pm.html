<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module provides an interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
As in expat, a single instance of the parser can only parse one
document. Calls to parsestring after the first for a given instance will
die.</p>
<p>Expat (and XML::Parser::Expat) are event based. As the parser
recognizes parts of the document (say the start or end of an XML
element), then any handlers registered for that type of an event are
called with suitable parameters.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>new</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a class method, the constructor for XML::Parser::Expat.
Options are passed as keyword value pairs. The recognized options
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ProtocolEncoding The protocol encoding name. The default is none.
The expat built-in encodings are: <code>UTF-8</code>,
<code>ISO-8859-1</code>, <code>UTF-16</code>, and <code>US-ASCII</code>.
Other encodings may be used if they have encoding maps in one of the
directories in the <code>@Encoding_Path</code> list. Setting the
protocol encoding overrides any encoding in the XML
declaration.</p></li>
<li><p>Namespaces When this option is given with a true value, then the
parser does namespace processing. By default, namespace processing is
turned off. When it is turned on, the parser consumes <em>xmlns</em>
attributes and strips off prefixes from element and attributes names
where those prefixes have a defined namespace. A name's namespace can be
found using the namespace method and two names can be checked for
absolute equality with the eq_name method.</p></li>
<li><p>NoExpand Normally, the parser will try to expand references to
entities defined in the internal subset. If this option is set to a true
value, and a default handler is also set, then the default handler will
be called when an entity reference is seen in text. This has no effect
if a default handler has not been registered, and it has no effect on
the expansion of entity references inside attribute values.</p></li>
<li><p>Stream_Delimiter This option takes a string value. When this
string is found alone on a line while parsing from a stream, then the
parse is ended as if it saw an end of file. The intended use is with a
stream of xml documents in a MIME multipart format. The string should
not contain a trailing newline.</p></li>
<li><p>ErrorContext When this option is defined, errors are reported in
context. The value of ErrorContext should be the number of lines to show
on either side of the line in which the error occurred.</p></li>
<li><p>ParseParamEnt Unless standalone is set to yes in the XML
declaration, setting this to a true value allows the external DTD to be
read, and parameter entities to be parsed and expanded.</p></li>
<li><p>Base The base to use for relative pathnames or URLs. This can
also be done by using the base method.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>setHandlers(TYPE, HANDLER [, TYPE, HANDLER [...]])</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method registers handlers for the various events. If no handlers
are registered, then a call to parsestring or parsefile will only
determine if the corresponding XML document is well formed (by returning
without error.) This may be called from within a handler, after the
parse has started. Setting a handler to something that evaluates to
false unsets that handler. This method returns a list of type, handler
pairs corresponding to the input. The handlers returned are the ones
that were in effect before the call to setHandlers. The recognized
events and the parameters passed to the corresponding handlers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start (Parser, Element [, Attr, Val [,...]]) This event is
generated when an XML start tag is recognized. Parser is an
XML::Parser::Expat instance. Element is the name of the XML element that
is opened with the start tag. The Attr &amp; Val pairs are generated for
each attribute in the start tag.</p></li>
<li><p>End (Parser, Element) This event is generated when an XML end tag
is recognized. Note that an XML empty tag (&lt;foo/&gt;) generates both
a start and an end event. There is always a lower level start and end
handler installed that wrap the corresponding callbacks. This is to
handle the context mechanism. A consequence of this is that the default
handler (see below) will not see a start tag or end tag unless the
default_current method is called.</p></li>
<li><p>Char (Parser, String) This event is generated when non-markup is
recognized. The non-markup sequence of characters is in String. A single
non-markup sequence of characters may generate multiple calls to this
handler. Whatever the encoding of the string in the original document,
this is given to the handler in UTF-8.</p></li>
<li><p>Proc (Parser, Target, Data) This event is generated when a
processing instruction is recognized.</p></li>
<li><p>Comment (Parser, String) This event is generated when a comment
is recognized.</p></li>
<li><p>CdataStart (Parser) This is called at the start of a CDATA
section.</p></li>
<li><p>CdataEnd (Parser) This is called at the end of a CDATA
section.</p></li>
<li><p>Default (Parser, String) This is called for any characters that
don't have a registered handler. This includes both characters that are
part of markup for which no events are generated (markup declarations)
and characters that could generate events, but for which no handler has
been registered. Whatever the encoding in the original document, the
string is returned to the handler in UTF-8.</p></li>
<li><p>Unparsed (Parser, Entity, Base, Sysid, Pubid, Notation) This is
called for a declaration of an unparsed entity. Entity is the name of
the entity. Base is the base to be used for resolving a relative URI.
Sysid is the system id. Pubid is the public id. Notation is the notation
name. Base and Pubid may be undefined.</p></li>
<li><p>Notation (Parser, Notation, Base, Sysid, Pubid) This is called
for a declaration of notation. Notation is the notation name. Base is
the base to be used for resolving a relative URI. Sysid is the system
id. Pubid is the public id. Base, Sysid, and Pubid may all be
undefined.</p></li>
<li><p>ExternEnt (Parser, Base, Sysid, Pubid) This is called when an
external entity is referenced. Base is the base to be used for resolving
a relative URI. Sysid is the system id. Pubid is the public id. Base,
and Pubid may be undefined. This handler should either return a string,
which represents the contents of the external entity, or return an open
filehandle that can be read to obtain the contents of the external
entity, or return undef, which indicates the external entity couldn't be
found and will generate a parse error. If an open filehandle is
returned, it must be returned as either a glob (*FOO) or as a reference
to a glob (e.g. an instance of IO::Handle).</p></li>
<li><p>ExternEntFin (Parser) This is called after an external entity has
been parsed. It allows applications to perform cleanup on actions
performed in the above ExternEnt handler.</p></li>
<li><p>Entity (Parser, Name, Val, Sysid, Pubid, Ndata, IsParam) This is
called when an entity is declared. For internal entities, the Val
parameter will contain the value and the remaining three parameters will
be undefined. For external entities, the Val parameter will be
undefined, the Sysid parameter will have the system id, the Pubid
parameter will have the public id if it was provided (it will be
undefined otherwise), the Ndata parameter will contain the notation for
unparsed entities. If this is a parameter entity declaration, then the
IsParam parameter is true. Note that this handler and the Unparsed
handler above overlap. If both are set, then this handler will not be
called for unparsed entities.</p></li>
<li><p>Element (Parser, Name, Model) The element handler is called when
an element declaration is found. Name is the element name, and Model is
the content model as an XML::Parser::ContentModel object. See
XML::Parser::ContentModel Methods for methods available for this
class.</p></li>
<li><p>Attlist (Parser, Elname, Attname, Type, Default, Fixed) This
handler is called for each attribute in an ATTLIST declaration. So an
ATTLIST declaration that has multiple attributes will generate multiple
calls to this handler. The Elname parameter is the name of the element
with which the attribute is being associated. The Attname parameter is
the name of the attribute. Type is the attribute type, given as a
string. Default is the default value, which will either be #REQUIRED,
#IMPLIED or a quoted string (i.e. the returned string will begin and end
with a quote character). If Fixed is true, then this is a fixed
attribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Doctype (Parser, Name, Sysid, Pubid, Internal) This handler is
called for DOCTYPE declarations. Name is the document type name. Sysid
is the system id of the document type, if it was provided, otherwise
it's undefined. Pubid is the public id of the document type, which will
be undefined if no public id was given. Internal will be true or false,
indicating whether or not the doctype declaration contains an internal
subset.</p></li>
<li><p>DoctypeFin (Parser) This handler is called after parsing of the
DOCTYPE declaration has finished, including any internal or external DTD
declarations.</p></li>
<li><p>XMLDecl (Parser, Version, Encoding, Standalone) This handler is
called for XML declarations. Version is a string containing the version.
Encoding is either undefined or contains an encoding string. Standalone
is either undefined, or true or false. Undefined indicates that no
standalone parameter was given in the XML declaration. True or false
indicates yes or no respectively.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>namespace(name)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return the URI of the namespace that the name belongs to. If the name
doesn't belong to any namespace, an undef is returned. This is only
valid on names received through the Start or End handlers from a single
document, or through a call to the generate_ns_name method. In other
words, don't use names generated from one instance of XML::Parser::Expat
with other instances.</p>
</dd>
<dt>eq_name(name1, name2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return true if name1 and name2 are identical (i.e. same name and from
the same namespace.) This is only meaningful if both names were obtained
through the Start or End handlers from a single document, or through a
call to the generate_ns_name method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>generate_ns_name(name, namespace)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return a name, associated with a given namespace, good for using with
the above 2 methods. The namespace argument should be the namespace URI,
not a prefix.</p>
</dd>
<dt>new_ns_prefixes</dt>
<dd>
<p>When called from a start tag handler, returns namespace prefixes
declared with this start tag. If called elsewhere (or if there were no
namespace prefixes declared), it returns an empty list. Setting of the
default namespace is indicated with '#default' as a prefix.</p>
</dd>
<dt>expand_ns_prefix(prefix)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return the uri to which the given prefix is currently bound. Returns
undef if the prefix isn't currently bound. Use '#default' to find the
current binding of the default namespace (if any).</p>
</dd>
<dt>current_ns_prefixes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return a list of currently bound namespace prefixes. The order of the
the prefixes in the list has no meaning. If the default namespace is
currently bound, '#default' appears in the list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>recognized_string</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the string from the document that was recognized in order to
call the current handler. For instance, when called from a start
handler, it will give us the start-tag string. The string is encoded in
UTF-8. This method doesn't return a meaningful string inside declaration
handlers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>original_string</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the verbatim string from the document that was recognized in
order to call the current handler. The string is in the original
document encoding. This method doesn't return a meaningful string inside
declaration handlers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>default_current</dt>
<dd>
<p>When called from a handler, causes the sequence of characters that
generated the corresponding event to be sent to the default handler (if
one is registered). Use of this method is deprecated in favor the
recognized_string method, which you can use without installing a default
handler. This method doesn't deliver a meaningful string to the default
handler when called from inside declaration handlers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>xpcroak(message)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Concatenate onto the given message the current line number within the
XML document plus the message implied by ErrorContext. Then croak with
the formed message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>xpcarp(message)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Concatenate onto the given message the current line number within the
XML document plus the message implied by ErrorContext. Then carp with
the formed message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>current_line</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the line number of the current position of the parse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>current_column</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the column number of the current position of the parse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>current_byte</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current position of the parse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>base([NEWBASE]);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the base for resolving relative URIs. If
NEWBASE is supplied, changes the base to that value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>context</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of element names that represent open elements, with
the last one being the innermost. Inside start and end tag handlers,
this will be the tag of the parent element.</p>
</dd>
<dt>current_element</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the innermost currently opened element. Inside
start or end handlers, returns the parent of the element associated with
those tags.</p>
</dd>
<dt>in_element(NAME)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns true if NAME is equal to the name of the innermost currently
opened element. If namespace processing is being used and you want to
check against a name that may be in a namespace, then use the
generate_ns_name method to create the NAME argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>within_element(NAME)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the number of times the given name appears in the context
list. If namespace processing is being used and you want to check
against a name that may be in a namespace, then use the generate_ns_name
method to create the NAME argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>depth</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the size of the context list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>element_index</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns an integer that is the depth-first visit order of the current
element. This will be zero outside of the root element. For example,
this will return 1 when called from the start handler for the root
element start tag.</p>
</dd>
<dt>skip_until(INDEX)</dt>
<dd>
<p>INDEX is an integer that represents an element index. When this
method is called, all handlers are suspended until the start tag for an
element that has an index number equal to INDEX is seen. If a start
handler has been set, then this is the first tag that the start handler
will see after skip_until has been called.</p>
</dd>
<dt>position_in_context(LINES)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a string that shows the current parse position. LINES should
be an integer &gt;= 0 that represents the number of lines on either side
of the current parse line to place into the returned string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>xml_escape(TEXT [, CHAR [, CHAR ...]])</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns TEXT with markup characters turned into character entities.
Any additional characters provided as arguments are also turned into
character references where found in TEXT.</p>
</dd>
<dt>parse (SOURCE)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The SOURCE parameter should either be a string containing the whole
XML document, or it should be an open IO::Handle. Only a single document
may be parsed for a given instance of XML::Parser::Expat, so this will
croak if it's been called previously for this instance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>parsestring(XML_DOC_STRING)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Parses the given string as an XML document. Only a single document
may be parsed for a given instance of XML::Parser::Expat, so this will
die if either parsestring or parsefile has been called for this instance
previously. This method is deprecated in favor of the parse method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>parsefile(FILENAME)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Parses the XML document in the given file. Will die if parsestring or
parsefile has been called previously for this instance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>is_defaulted(ATTNAME)</dt>
<dd>
<p>NO LONGER WORKS. To find out if an attribute is defaulted please use
the specified_attr method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>specified_attr</dt>
<dd>
<p>When the start handler receives lists of attributes and values, the
non-defaulted (i.e. explicitly specified) attributes occur in the list
first. This method returns the number of specified items in the list. So
if this number is equal to the length of the list, there were no
defaulted values. Otherwise the number points to the index of the first
defaulted attribute name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>finish</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unsets all handlers (including internal ones that set context), but
expat continues parsing to the end of the document or until it finds an
error. It should finish up a lot faster than with the handlers set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>release</dt>
<dd>
<p>There are data structures used by XML::Parser::Expat that have
circular references. This means that these structures will never be
garbage collected unless these references are explicitly broken. Calling
this method breaks those references (and makes the instance unusable.)
Normally, higher level calls handle this for you, but if you are using
XML::Parser::Expat directly, then it's your responsibility to call
it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>XML::Parser::ContentModel Methods</h2>
<p>The element declaration handlers are passed objects of this class as
the content model of the element declaration. They also represent
content particles, components of a content model.</p>
<p>When referred to as a string, these objects are automagicly converted
to a string representation of the model (or content particle).</p>
<dl>
<dt>isempty</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns true if the object is EMPTY, false otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>isany</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns true if the object is ANY, false otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ismixed</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns true if the object is (#PCDATA) or
(#PCDATA|...)*, false otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>isname</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns if the object is an element name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ischoice</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns true if the object is a choice of content
particles.</p>
</dd>
<dt>isseq</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns true if the object is a sequence of content
particles.</p>
</dd>
<dt>quant</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns undef or a string representing the quantifier
('?', '*', '+') associated with the model or particle.</p>
</dd>
<dt>children</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns undef or (for mixed, choice, and sequence types)
an array of component content particles. There will always be at least
one component for choices and sequences, but for a mixed content model
of pure PCDATA, (#PCDATA), then an undef is returned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>XML::Parser::ExpatNB Methods</h2>
<p>The class XML::Parser::ExpatNB is a subclass of XML::Parser::Expat
used for non-blocking access to the expat library. It does not support
the parse, parsestring, or parsefile methods, but it does have these
additional methods:</p>
<dl>
<dt>parse_more(DATA)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Feed expat more text to munch on.</p>
</dd>
<dt>parse_done</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tell expat that it's gotten the whole document.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>XML::Parser::Expat::load_encoding(ENCODING)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Load an external encoding. ENCODING is either the name of an encoding
or the name of a file. The basename is converted to lowercase and a
'.enc' extension is appended unless there's one already there. Then,
unless it's an absolute pathname (i.e. begins with '/'), the first file
by that name discovered in the <code>@Encoding_Path</code> path list is
used. The encoding in the file is loaded and kept in the
<code>%Encoding_Table</code> table. Earlier encodings of the same name
are replaced. This function is automatically called by expat when it
encounters an encoding it doesn't know about. Expat shouldn't call this
twice for the same encoding name. The only reason users should use this
function is to explicitly load an encoding not contained in the
<code>@Encoding_Path</code> list.</p>
