<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::clipboard - Manipulate Tk clipboard</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>clipboard</strong><em>Option</em>?(<em>args</em>)?</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command provides an interface to the Tk clipboard, which stores
data for later retrieval using the selection mechanism. In order to copy
data into the clipboard, <strong>clipboardClear</strong> must be called,
followed by a sequence of one or more calls to
<strong>clipboardAppend</strong>. To ensure that the clipboard is
updated atomically, all appends should be completed before returning to
the event loop.</p>
<p>The following methods are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;clipboardClear</dt>
<dd>
<p>Claims ownership of the clipboard on <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s
display and removes any previous contents. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;clipboardAppend(?-format=&gt;format?,?-type=&gt;type?,?--?,data)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Appends <em>data</em> to the clipboard on <code>$widget</code>'s
display in the form given by <em>type</em> with the representation given
by <em>format</em> and claims ownership of the clipboard on
<code>$widget</code>'s display.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Type</em> specifies the form in which the selection is to be
returned (the desired ``target'' for conversion, in ICCCM terminology),
and should be an atom name such as STRING or FILE_NAME; see the
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual for complete details.
<em>Type</em> defaults to STRING. The <em>format</em> argument specifies
the representation that should be used to transmit the selection to the
requester (the second column of Table 2 of the ICCCM), and defaults to
STRING. If <em>format</em> is STRING, the selection is transmitted as
8-bit ASCII characters. See the Tk::Selection documentation for
explanation of what happens if <em>format</em> is not STRING. Note that
arguments passed to <strong>clipboardAppend</strong> are concatenated
before conversion, so the caller must take care to ensure appropriate
spacing across string boundaries. All items appended to the clipboard
with the same <em>type</em> must have the same <em>format</em>. A
<strong>--</strong> argument may be specified to mark the end of
options: the next argument will always be used as <em>data</em>. This
feature may be convenient if, for example, <em>data</em> starts with a
<strong>-</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;clipboardGet( ?-type? );</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieve data from the clipboard on <em>widget</em>'s display.
<em>-type</em> specifies the form in which the data is to be returned
and should be an atom name such as STRING or FILE_NAME. Type defaults to
STRING. This command is equivalent to
<code>SelectionGet( -selection =&gt; CLIPBOARD )</code>.</p>
