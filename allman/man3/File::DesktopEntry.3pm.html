<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>File::DesktopEntry - Object to handle .desktop files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use File::DesktopEntry; my $entry =
File::DesktopEntry-&gt;new(firefox); print "Using ".$entry-&gt;Name." to
open http://perl.org\n"; $entry-&gt;run(http://perl.org);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module is designed to work with <em>.desktop</em> files. The
format of these files is specified by the freedesktop Desktop Entry
specification. This module can parse these files but also knows how to
run the applications defined by these files.</p>
<p>For this module version 1.0 of the specification was used.</p>
<p>This module was written to support File::MimeInfo::Applications.</p>
<p>Please remember: case is significant for the names of Desktop Entry
keys.</p>
<h1>VARIABLES</h1>
<p>You can set the global variable
<code>$File::DesktopEntry::VERBOSE</code>. If set the module prints a
warning every time a command gets executed.</p>
<p>The global variable <code>$File::DesktopEntry::LOCALE</code> tells
you what the default locale being used is. However, changing it will not
change the default locale.</p>
<h1>AUTOLOAD</h1>
<p>All methods that start with a capital are autoloaded as
<code>get(KEY)</code> where key is the autoloaded method name.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>"new(FILE)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>"new(\$TEXT)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>"new(NAME)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Constructor. FILE, NAME or TEXT are optional arguments. When a name
is given (a string without '<code>/</code>', '<code>\</code>' or
'<code>.</code>') a lookup is done using File::BaseDir. If the file
found in this lookup is not writable or if no file was found, the
XDG_DATA_HOME path will be used when writing.</p>
<dl>
<dt>"lookup(NAME)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a filename for a desktop entry with desktop file id NAME.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"wants_uris( )"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns true if the Exec string for this desktop entry specifies that
the application uses URIs instead of paths. This can be used to
determine whether an application uses a VFS library.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"wants_list( )"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns true if the Exec string for this desktop entry specifies that
the application can handle multiple arguments at once.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"run(@FILES)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Forks and runs the application specified in this Desktop Entry with
arguments FILES as a background process. Returns the pid. The child
process fails when this is not a Desktop Entry of type Application or if
the Exec key is missing or invalid. If the desktop entry specifies that
the program needs to be executed in a terminal the
<code>$TERMINAL</code> environment variable is used. If this variable is
not set <code>x-terminal-emulator -e</code> is used as default on Debian
systems. (On Windows this method returns a Win32::Process object.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>"system(@FILES)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like <code>run()</code> but using the <code>system()</code> system
call. It only return after the application has ended.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"exec(@FILES)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like <code>run()</code> but using the <code>exec()</code> system
call. This method is expected not to return but to replace the current
process with the application you try to run. On Windows this method
doesn't always work the way you want it to due to the
<code>fork()</code> emulation on this platform. Try using
<code>run()</code> or <code>system()</code> instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"parse_Exec(@FILES)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Expands the Exec format in this desktop entry with. Returns a
properly quoted string in scalar context or a list of words in list
context. Dies when the Exec key is invalid. It supports the following
fields: %f single file %F multiple files %u single url %U multiple urls
%i Icon field prefixed by --icon %c Name field, possibly translated %k
location of this .desktop file %% literal % If necessary this method
tries to convert between paths and URLs but this is not perfect. Fields
that are deprecated, but (still) supported by this module: %d single
directory %D multiple directories The fields <code>%n</code>,
<code>%N</code>, <code>%v</code> and <code>%m</code> are deprecated and
will cause a warning if <code>$VERBOSE</code> is used. Any other unknown
fields will cause an error. The fields <code>%F</code>, <code>%U</code>,
<code>%D</code> and <code>%i</code> can only occur as separate words
because they expand to multiple arguments. Also see LIMITATIONS.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"get(KEY)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>"get(GROUP, KEY)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Get a value for KEY from GROUP. If GROUP is not specified 'Desktop
Entry' is used. All values are treated as string, so e.g. booleans will
be returned as the literal strings true and false. When KEY does not
contain a language code you get the translation in the current locale if
available or a sensible default. The request a specific language you can
add the language part. E.g. <code>$entry-&gt;get(Name[nl_NL])</code> can
return either the value of the 'Name[nl_NL]', the 'Name[nl]' or the
'Name' key in the Desktop Entry file. Exact language parsing order can
be found in the spec. To force you get the untranslated key use either
'Name[C]' or 'Name[POSIX]'.</p>
<dl>
<dt>"set(KEY =&gt; VALUE, ...)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>"set(GROUP, KEY =&gt; VALUE, ...)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Set values for one or more keys. If GROUP is not given Desktop Entry
is used. All values are treated as strings, backslashes, newlines and
tabs are escaped. To set a boolean key you need to use the literal
strings true and false. Unlike the <code>get()</code> call languages are
not handled automatically for <code>set()</code>. KEY should include the
language part if you want to set a translation. E.g.
<code>$entry-&gt;set("Name[nl_NL]" =&gt; "Tekst Verwerker")</code> will
set a Dutch translation for the Name key. Using either Name[C] or
Name[POSIX] will be equivalent with not giving a language argument. When
setting the Exec key without specifying a group it will be parsed and
quoted correctly as required by the spec. You can use quoted arguments
to include whitespace in a argument, escaping whitespace does not work.
To circumvent this quoting explicitly give the group name 'Desktop
Entry'.</p>
<dl>
<dt>"text()"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the (modified) text of the file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"read(FILE)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>"read(\$SCALAR)"</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Read Desktop Entry data from file or memory buffer. Without argument
defaults to file given at constructor. If you gave a file, text buffer
or name to the constructor this method will be called automatically.</p>
<dl>
<dt>"read_fh(IO)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Read Desktop Entry data from filehandle or IO object.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"write(FILE)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write the Desktop Entry data to FILE. Without arguments it writes to
the filename given to the constructor if any. The keys Name and Type are
required. Type can be either <code>Application</code>, <code>Link</code>
or <code>Directory</code>. For an application set the optional key
<code>Exec</code>. For a link set the <code>URL</code> key.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>Methods supported for backwards compatibility with 0.02.</p>
<dl>
<dt>"new_from_file(FILE)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Alias for <code>new(FILE)</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"new_from_data(TEXT)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Alias for <code>new(\$TEXT)</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"get_value(NAME, GROUP, LANG)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identical to <code>get(GROUP, "NAME[LANG]")</code>. LANG defaults to
'C', GROUP is optional.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NON-UNIX PLATFORMS</h1>
<p>This module has a few bits of code to make it work on Windows. It
handles <code>file://</code> uri a bit different and it uses
Win32::Process. On other platforms your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Please note that the specification is targeting Unix platforms only
and will only have limited relevance on other platforms. Any
platform-dependent behavior in this module should be considered an
extension of the spec.</p>
<h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
<p>If you try to exec a remote file with an application that can only
handle files on the local file system we should -according to the spec-
download the file to a temp location. This is not supported. Use the
<code>wants_uris()</code> method to check if an application supports
urls.</p>
<p>The values of the various Desktop Entry keys are not parsed (except
for the Exec key). This means that booleans will be returned as the
strings true and false and lists will still be ; separated.</p>
<p>If the icon is given as name and not as path it should be resolved
for the <code>%i</code> code in the Exec key. We need a separate module
for the icon spec to deal with this.</p>
<p>According to the spec comments can contain any encoding. However
since this module read files as utf8, invalid UTF-8 characters in a
comment will cause an error.</p>
<p>There is no support for Legacy-Mixed Encoding. Everybody is using
utf8 now ... right ?</p>
