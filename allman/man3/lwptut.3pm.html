<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>lwptut -- An LWP Tutorial</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>LWP (short for Library for WWW in Perl) is a very popular group of
Perl modules for accessing data on the Web. Like most Perl
module-distributions, each of LWP's component modules comes with
documentation that is a complete reference to its interface. However,
there are so many modules in LWP that it's hard to know where to start
looking for information on how to do even the simplest most common
things.</p>
<p>Really introducing you to using LWP would require a whole book Î©- a
book that just happens to exist, called <em>Perl &amp; LWP</em>. But
this article should give you a taste of how you can go about some common
tasks with LWP.</p>
<h2>Getting documents with LWP::Simple</h2>
<p>If you just want to get what's at a particular URL, the simplest way
to do it is LWP::Simple's functions.</p>
<p>In a Perl program, you can call its <code>get($url)</code> function.
It will try getting that URL's content. If it works, then it'll return
the content; but if there's some error, it'll return undef.</p>
<p>my $url = http://www.npr.org/programs/fa/?todayDate=current; # Just
an example: the URL for the most recent /Fresh Air/ show use
LWP::Simple; my $content = get $url; die "Couldnt get $url" unless
defined $content; # Then go do things with $content, like this:
if($content =~ m/jazz/i) { print "Theyre talking about jazz today on
Fresh Air!\n"; } else { print "Fresh Air is apparently jazzless
today.\n"; }</p>
<p>The handiest variant on <code>get</code> is <code>getprint</code>,
which is useful in Perl one-liners. If it can get the page whose URL you
provide, it sends it to STDOUT; otherwise it complains to STDERR.</p>
<p>% perl -MLWP::Simple -e "getprint http://www.cpan.org/RECENT"</p>
<p>That is the URL of a plain text file that lists new files in CPAN in
the past two weeks. You can easily make it part of a tidy little shell
command, like this one that mails you the list of new
<code>Acme::</code> modules:</p>
<p>% perl -MLWP::Simple -e "getprint http://www.cpan.org/RECENT" \ |
grep "/by-module/Acme" | mail -s "New Acme modules! Joy!" $USER</p>
<p>There are other useful functions in LWP::Simple, including one
function for running a HEAD request on a URL (useful for checking links,
or getting the last-revised time of a URL), and two functions for
saving/mirroring a URL to a local file. See the LWP::Simple
documentation for the full details, or chapter 2 of <em>Perl</em> &amp;
LWP for more examples.</p>
<h2>The Basics of the LWP Class Model</h2>
<p>LWP::Simple's functions are handy for simple cases, but its functions
don't support cookies or authorization, don't support setting header
lines in the HTTP request, generally don't support reading header lines
in the HTTP response (notably the full HTTP error message, in case of an
error). To get at all those features, you'll have to use the full LWP
class model.</p>
<p>While LWP consists of dozens of classes, the main two that you have
to understand are LWP::UserAgent and HTTP::Response. LWP::UserAgent is a
class for virtual browsers which you use for performing requests, and
HTTP::Response is a class for the responses (or error messages) that you
get back from those requests.</p>
<p>The basic idiom is <code>$response = $browser-&gt;get($url)</code>,
or more fully illustrated:</p>
<p># Early in your program: use LWP 5.64; # Loads all important LWP
classes, and makes # sure your version is reasonably recent. my $browser
= LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new; ... # Then later, whenever you need to make a
get request: my $url =
http://www.npr.org/programs/fa/?todayDate=current; my $response =
$browser-&gt;get( $url ); die "Cant get $url -- ",
$response-&gt;status_line unless $response-&gt;is_success; die "Hey, I
was expecting HTML, not ", $response-&gt;content_type unless
$response-&gt;content_type eq text/html; # or whatever content-type
youre equipped to deal with # Otherwise, process the content somehow:
if($response-&gt;decoded_content =~ m/jazz/i) { print "Theyre talking
about jazz today on Fresh Air!\n"; } else { print "Fresh Air is
apparently jazzless today.\n"; }</p>
<p>There are two objects involved: <code>$browser</code>, which holds an
object of class LWP::UserAgent, and then the <code>$response</code>
object, which is of class HTTP::Response. You really need only one
browser object per program; but every time you make a request, you get
back a new HTTP::Response object, which will have some interesting
attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A status code indicating success or failure (which you can test
with <code>$response-&gt;is_success</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>An HTTP status line that is hopefully informative if there's
failure (which you can see with <code>$response-&gt;status_line</code>,
returning something like 404 Not Found).</p></li>
<li><p>A MIME content-type like text/html, image/gif, application/xml,
etc., which you can see with
<code>$response-&gt;content_type</code></p></li>
<li><p>The actual content of the response, in
<code>$response-&gt;decoded_content</code>. If the response is HTML,
that's where the HTML source will be; if it's a GIF, then
<code>$response-&gt;decoded_content</code> will be the binary GIF
data.</p></li>
<li><p>And dozens of other convenient and more specific methods that are
documented in the docs for HTTP::Response, and its superclasses
HTTP::Message and HTTP::Headers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Other HTTP Request Headers</h2>
<p>The most commonly used syntax for requests is
<code>$response =</code> $browser-&gt;get($url), but in truth, you can
add extra HTTP header lines to the request by adding a list of key-value
pairs after the URL, like so:</p>
<p>$response = $browser-&gt;get( $url, $key1, $value1, $key2, $value2,
... );</p>
<p>For example, here's how to send some commonly used headers, in case
you're dealing with a site that would otherwise reject your request:</p>
<p>my @ns_headers = ( User-Agent =&gt; Mozilla/4.76 [en] (Win98; U),
Accept =&gt; image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg,
image/png, */*, Accept-Charset =&gt; iso-8859-1,*,utf-8, Accept-Language
=&gt; en-US, ); ... $response = $browser-&gt;get($url, @ns_headers);</p>
<p>If you weren't reusing that array, you could just go ahead and do
this:</p>
<p>$response = $browser-&gt;get($url, User-Agent =&gt; Mozilla/4.76 [en]
(Win98; U), Accept =&gt; image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg,
image/pjpeg, image/png, */*, Accept-Charset =&gt; iso-8859-1,*,utf-8,
Accept-Language =&gt; en-US, );</p>
<p>If you were only ever changing the 'User-Agent' line, you could just
change the <code>$browser</code> object's default line from
libwww-perl/5.65 (or the like) to whatever you like, using the
LWP::UserAgent <code>agent</code> method:</p>
<p>$browser-&gt;agent(Mozilla/4.76 [en] (Win98; U));</p>
<h2>Enabling Cookies</h2>
<p>A default LWP::UserAgent object acts like a browser with its cookies
support turned off. There are various ways of turning it on, by setting
its <code>cookie_jar</code> attribute. A cookie jar is an object
representing a little database of all the HTTP cookies that a browser
knows about. It can correspond to a file on disk or an in-memory object
that starts out empty, and whose collection of cookies will disappear
once the program is finished running.</p>
<p>To give a browser an in-memory empty cookie jar, you set its
<code>cookie_jar</code> attribute like so:</p>
<p>use HTTP::CookieJar::LWP; $browser-&gt;cookie_jar(
HTTP::CookieJar::LWP-&gt;new );</p>
<p>To save a cookie jar to disk, see dump_cookies in HTTP::CookieJar. To
load cookies from disk into a jar, see load_cookies in
HTTP::CookieJar.</p>
<h2>Posting Form Data</h2>
<p>Many HTML forms send data to their server using an HTTP POST request,
which you can send with this syntax:</p>
<p>$response = $browser-&gt;post( $url, [ formkey1 =&gt; value1,
formkey2 =&gt; value2, ... ], );</p>
<p>Or if you need to send HTTP headers:</p>
<p>$response = $browser-&gt;post( $url, [ formkey1 =&gt; value1,
formkey2 =&gt; value2, ... ], headerkey1 =&gt; value1, headerkey2 =&gt;
value2, );</p>
<p>For example, the following program makes a search request to
AltaVista (by sending some form data via an HTTP POST request), and
extracts from the HTML the report of the number of matches:</p>
<p>use strict; use warnings; use LWP 5.64; my $browser =
LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new; my $word = tarragon; my $url =
http://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search; my $response = $browser-&gt;post(
$url, [ q =&gt; $word, # the Altavista query string fr =&gt; altavista,
pg =&gt; q, avkw =&gt; tgz, kl =&gt; XX, ] ); die "$url error: ",
$response-&gt;status_line unless $response-&gt;is_success; die "Weird
content type at $url -- ", $response-&gt;content_type unless
$response-&gt;content_is_html; if( $response-&gt;decoded_content =~
m{([0-9,]+)(?:&lt;.*?&gt;)? results for} ) { # The substring will be
like "996,000&lt;/strong&gt; results for" print "$word: $1\n"; } else {
print "Couldnt find the match-string in the response\n"; }</p>
<h2>Sending GET Form Data</h2>
<p>Some HTML forms convey their form data not by sending the data in an
HTTP POST request, but by making a normal GET request with the data
stuck on the end of the URL. For example, if you went to
<code>www.imdb.com</code> and ran a search on Blade Runner, the URL
you'd see in your browser window would be:</p>
<p>http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=Blade+Runner</p>
<p>To run the same search with LWP, you'd use this idiom, which involves
the URI class:</p>
<p>use URI; my $url = URI-&gt;new( http://www.imdb.com/find ); # makes
an object representing the URL $url-&gt;query_form( # And here the form
data pairs: q =&gt; Blade Runner, s =&gt; all, ); my $response =
$browser-&gt;get($url);</p>
<p>See chapter 5 of <em>Perl &amp; LWP</em> for a longer discussion of
HTML forms and of form data, and chapters 6 through 9 for a longer
discussion of extracting data from HTML.</p>
<h2>Absolutizing URLs</h2>
<p>The URI class that we just mentioned above provides all sorts of
methods for accessing and modifying parts of URLs (such as asking sort
of URL it is with <code>$url-&gt;scheme</code>, and asking what host it
refers to with <code>$url-&gt;host</code>, and so on, as described in
the docs for the URI class. However, the methods of most immediate
interest are the <code>query_form</code> method seen above, and now the
<code>new_abs</code> method for taking a probably-relative URL string
(like ../foo.html) and getting back an absolute URL (like
http://www.perl.com/stuff/foo.html), as shown here:</p>
<p>use URI; $abs = URI-&gt;new_abs($maybe_relative, $base);</p>
<p>For example, consider this program that matches URLs in the HTML list
of new modules in CPAN:</p>
<p>use strict; use warnings; use LWP; my $browser =
LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new; my $url = http://www.cpan.org/RECENT.html; my
$response = $browser-&gt;get($url); die "Cant get $url -- ",
$response-&gt;status_line unless $response-&gt;is_success; my $html =
$response-&gt;decoded_content; while( $html =~ m/&lt;A HREF=\"(.*?)\"/g
) { print "$1\n"; }</p>
<p>When run, it emits output that starts out something like this:</p>
<p>MIRRORING.FROM RECENT RECENT.html authors/00whois.html
authors/01mailrc.txt.gz authors/id/A/AA/AASSAD/CHECKSUMS ...</p>
<p>However, if you actually want to have those be absolute URLs, you can
use the URI module's <code>new_abs</code> method, by changing the
<code>while</code> loop to this:</p>
<p>while( $html =~ m/&lt;A HREF=\"(.*?)\"/g ) { print URI-&gt;new_abs(
$1, $response-&gt;base ) ,"\n"; }</p>
<p>(The <code>$response-&gt;base</code> method from HTTP::Message is for
returning what URL should be used for resolving relative URLs Î©- it's
usually just the same as the URL that you requested.)</p>
<p>That program then emits nicely absolute URLs:</p>
<p>http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORING.FROM http://www.cpan.org/RECENT
http://www.cpan.org/RECENT.html http://www.cpan.org/authors/00whois.html
http://www.cpan.org/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/A/AA/AASSAD/CHECKSUMS ...</p>
<p>See chapter 4 of <em>Perl &amp; LWP</em> for a longer discussion of
URI objects.</p>
<p>Of course, using a regexp to match hrefs is a bit simplistic, and for
more robust programs, you'll probably want to use an HTML-parsing module
like HTML::LinkExtor or HTML::TokeParser or even maybe
HTML::TreeBuilder.</p>
<h2>Other Browser Attributes</h2>
<p>LWP::UserAgent objects have many attributes for controlling how they
work. Here are a few notable ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$browser-&gt;timeout(15);</code> This sets this browser
object to give up on requests that don't answer within 15
seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$browser-&gt;protocols_allowed( [ http, gopher] );</code>
This sets this browser object to not speak any protocols other than HTTP
and gopher. If it tries accessing any other kind of URL (like an ftp: or
mailto: or news: URL), then it won't actually try connecting, but
instead will immediately return an error code 500, with a message like
Access to 'ftp' URIs has been disabled.</p></li>
<li><p><code>use LWP::ConnCache; $browser-&gt;conn_cache(LWP::ConnCache-&gt;new());</code>
This tells the browser object to try using the HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive
feature, which speeds up requests by reusing the same socket connection
for multiple requests to the same server.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$browser-&gt;agent( SomeName/1.23 (more info here maybe) )</code>
This changes how the browser object will identify itself in the default
User-Agent line is its HTTP requests. By default, it'll send
"libwww-perl/<em>versionnumber</em>, like libwww-perl/5.65". You can
change that to something more descriptive like this: $browser-&gt;agent(
SomeName/3.14 (contact@robotplexus.int) ); Or if need be, you can go in
disguise, like this: $browser-&gt;agent( Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE
5.12; Mac_PowerPC) );</p></li>
<li><p><code>push @{ $ua-&gt;requests_redirectable }, POST;</code> This
tells this browser to obey redirection responses to POST requests (like
most modern interactive browsers), even though the HTTP RFC says that
should not normally be done.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For more options and information, see the full documentation for
LWP::UserAgent.</p>
<h2>Writing Polite Robots</h2>
<p>If you want to make sure that your LWP-based program respects
<em>robots.txt</em> files and doesn't make too many requests too fast,
you can use the LWP::RobotUA class instead of the LWP::UserAgent
class.</p>
<p>LWP::RobotUA class is just like LWP::UserAgent, and you can use it
like so:</p>
<p>use LWP::RobotUA; my $browser =
LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new(YourSuperBot/1.34, you@yoursite.com); # Your bots
name and your email address my $response = $browser-&gt;get($url);</p>
<p>But HTTP::RobotUA adds these features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the <em>robots.txt</em> on <code>$url</code>'s server forbids
you from accessing <code>$url</code>, then the <code>$browser</code>
object (assuming it's of class LWP::RobotUA) won't actually request it,
but instead will give you back (in <code>$response</code>) a 403 error
with a message Forbidden by robots.txt. That is, if you have this line:
die "$url -- ", $response-&gt;status_line, "\nAborted" unless
$response-&gt;is_success; then the program would die with an error
message like this: http://whatever.site.int/pith/x.html -- 403 Forbidden
by robots.txt Aborted at whateverprogram.pl line 1234</p></li>
<li><p>If this <code>$browser</code> object sees that the last time it
talked to <code>$url</code>'s server was too recently, then it will
pause (via <code>sleep</code>) to avoid making too many requests too
often. How long it will pause for, is by default one minute Î©- but you
can control it with the
<code>$browser-&gt;delay( </code><em><code>minutes</code></em><code> )</code>
attribute. For example, this code: $browser-&gt;delay( 7/60 ); ...means
that this browser will pause when it needs to avoid talking to any given
server more than once every 7 seconds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For more options and information, see the full documentation for
LWP::RobotUA.</p>
<h2>Using Proxies</h2>
<p>In some cases, you will want to (or will have to) use proxies for
accessing certain sites and/or using certain protocols. This is most
commonly the case when your LWP program is running (or could be running)
on a machine that is behind a firewall.</p>
<p>To make a browser object use proxies that are defined in the usual
environment variables (<code>HTTP_PROXY</code>, etc.), just call the
<code>env_proxy</code> on a user-agent object before you go making any
requests on it. Specifically:</p>
<p>use LWP::UserAgent; my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new; # And
before you go making any requests: $browser-&gt;env_proxy;</p>
<p>For more information on proxy parameters, see the LWP::UserAgent
documentation, specifically the <code>proxy</code>,
<code>env_proxy</code>, and <code>no_proxy</code> methods.</p>
<h2>HTTP Authentication</h2>
<p>Many web sites restrict access to documents by using HTTP
Authentication. This isn't just any form of enter your password
restriction, but is a specific mechanism where the HTTP server sends the
browser an HTTP code that says That document is part of a protected
'realm', and you can access it only if you re-request it and add some
special authorization headers to your request.</p>
<p>For example, the Unicode.org admins stop email-harvesting bots from
harvesting the contents of their mailing list archives, by protecting
them with HTTP Authentication, and then publicly stating the username
and password (at <code>http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/</code>) Î©-
namely username unicode-ml and password unicode.</p>
<p>For example, consider this URL, which is part of the protected area
of the web site:</p>
<p>http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2002-m08/0067.html</p>
<p>If you access that with a browser, you'll get a prompt like Enter
username and password for 'Unicode-MailList-Archives' at server
'www.unicode.org'.</p>
<p>In LWP, if you just request that URL, like this:</p>
<p>use LWP; my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new; my $url =
http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2002-m08/0067.html; my
$response = $browser-&gt;get($url); die "Error: ",
$response-&gt;header(WWW-Authenticate) || Error accessing, #
(WWW-Authenticate is the realm-name) "\n ", $response-&gt;status_line,
"\n at $url\n Aborting" unless $response-&gt;is_success;</p>
<p>Then you'll get this error:</p>
<p>Error: Basic realm="Unicode-MailList-Archives" 401 Authorization
Required at
http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2002-m08/0067.html Aborting
at auth1.pl line 9. [or wherever]</p>
<p>...because the <code>$browser</code> doesn't know any the username
and password for that realm (Unicode-MailList-Archives) at that host
(www.unicode.org). The simplest way to let the browser know about this
is to use the <code>credentials</code> method to let it know about a
username and password that it can try using for that realm at that host.
The syntax is:</p>
<p>$browser-&gt;credentials( servername:portnumber, realm-name, username
=&gt; password );</p>
<p>In most cases, the port number is 80, the default TCP/IP port for
HTTP; and you usually call the <code>credentials</code> method before
you make any requests. For example:</p>
<p>$browser-&gt;credentials( reports.mybazouki.com:80,
web_server_usage_reports, plinky =&gt; banjo123 );</p>
<p>So if we add the following to the program above, right after the
<code>$browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;</code> line...</p>
<p>$browser-&gt;credentials( # add this to our $browser s "key ring"
www.unicode.org:80, Unicode-MailList-Archives, unicode-ml =&gt; unicode
);</p>
<p>...then when we run it, the request succeeds, instead of causing the
<code>die</code> to be called.</p>
<h2>Accessing HTTPS URLs</h2>
<p>When you access an HTTPS URL, it'll work for you just like an HTTP
URL would Î©- if your LWP installation has HTTPS support (via an
appropriate Secure Sockets Layer library). For example:</p>
<p>use LWP; my $url = https://www.paypal.com/; # Yes, HTTPS! my $browser
= LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new; my $response = $browser-&gt;get($url); die
"Error at $url\n ", $response-&gt;status_line, "\n Aborting" unless
$response-&gt;is_success; print "Whee, it worked! I got that ",
$response-&gt;content_type, " document!\n";</p>
<p>If your LWP installation doesn't have HTTPS support set up, then the
response will be unsuccessful, and you'll get this error message:</p>
<p>Error at https://www.paypal.com/ 501 Protocol scheme https is not
supported Aborting at paypal.pl line 7. [or whatever program and
line]</p>
<p>If your LWP installation <em>does</em> have HTTPS support installed,
then the response should be successful, and you should be able to
consult <code>$response</code> just like with any normal HTTP
response.</p>
<p>For information about installing HTTPS support for your LWP
installation, see the helpful <em>README.SSL</em> file that comes in the
libwww-perl distribution.</p>
<h2>Getting Large Documents</h2>
<p>When you're requesting a large (or at least potentially large)
document, a problem with the normal way of using the request methods
(like <code>$response = $browser-&gt;get($url)</code>) is that the
response object in memory will have to hold the whole document Î©- <em>in
memory</em>. If the response is a thirty megabyte file, this is likely
to be quite an imposition on this process's memory usage.</p>
<p>A notable alternative is to have LWP save the content to a file on
disk, instead of saving it up in memory. This is the syntax to use:</p>
<p>$response = $ua-&gt;get($url, :content_file =&gt; $filespec, );</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>$response = $ua-&gt;get(http://search.cpan.org/, :content_file =&gt;
/tmp/sco.html );</p>
<p>When you use this <code>:content_file</code> option, the
<code>$response</code> will have all the normal header lines, but
<code>$response-&gt;content</code> will be empty. Errors writing to the
content file (for example due to permission denied or the filesystem
being full) will be reported via the <code>Client-Aborted</code> or
<code>X-Died</code> response headers, and not the
<code>is_success</code> method:</p>
<p>if ($response-&gt;header(Client-Aborted) eq die) { # handle error
...</p>
<p>Note that this :content_file option isn't supported under older
versions of LWP, so you should consider adding
<code>use LWP 5.66;</code> to check the LWP version, if you think your
program might run on systems with older versions.</p>
<p>If you need to be compatible with older LWP versions, then use this
syntax, which does the same thing:</p>
<p>use HTTP::Request::Common; $response = $ua-&gt;request( GET($url),
$filespec );</p>
