<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>LWP::Protocol - Base class for LWP protocols</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>package LWP::Protocol::foo; use parent qw(LWP::Protocol);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This class is used as the base class for all protocol implementations
supported by the LWP library.</p>
<p>When creating an instance of this class using
<code>LWP::Protocol::create($url)</code>, and you get an initialized
subclass appropriate for that access method. In other words, the create
in LWP::Protocol function calls the constructor for one of its
subclasses.</p>
<p>All derived <code>LWP::Protocol</code> classes need to override the
<code>request()</code> method which is used to service a request. The
overridden method can make use of the <code>collect()</code> method to
collect together chunks of data as it is received.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>The following methods and functions are provided:</p>
<h2>new</h2>
<p>my $prot = LWP::Protocol-&gt;new();</p>
<p>The LWP::Protocol constructor is inherited by subclasses. As this is
a virtual base class this method should <strong>not</strong> be called
directly.</p>
<h2>create</h2>
<p>my $prot = LWP::Protocol::create($scheme)</p>
<p>Create an object of the class implementing the protocol to handle the
given scheme. This is a function, not a method. It is more an object
factory than a constructor. This is the function user agents should use
to access protocols.</p>
<h2>implementor</h2>
<p>my $class = LWP::Protocol::implementor($scheme, [$class])</p>
<p>Get and/or set implementor class for a scheme. Returns if the
specified scheme is not supported.</p>
<h2>request</h2>
<p>$response = $protocol-&gt;request($request, $proxy, undef); $response
= $protocol-&gt;request($request, $proxy, /tmp/sss); $response =
$protocol-&gt;request($request, $proxy, \&amp;callback, 1024); $response
= $protocol-&gt;request($request, $proxy, $fh);</p>
<p>Dispatches a request over the protocol, and returns a response
object. This method needs to be overridden in subclasses. Refer to
LWP::UserAgent for description of the arguments.</p>
<h2>collect</h2>
<p>my $res = $prot-&gt;collect(undef, $response, $collector); # stored
in $response my $res = $prot-&gt;collect($filename, $response,
$collector); my $res = $prot-&gt;collect(sub { ... }, $response,
$collector);</p>
<p>Collect the content of a request, and process it appropriately into a
scalar, file, or by calling a callback. If the first parameter is
undefined, then the content is stored within the <code>$response</code>.
If it's a simple scalar, then it's interpreted as a file name and the
content is written to this file. If it's a code reference, then content
is passed to this routine. If it is a filehandle, or similar, such as a
File::Temp object, content will be written to it.</p>
<p>The collector is a routine that will be called and which is
responsible for returning pieces (as ref to scalar) of the content to
process. The <code>$collector</code> signals <code>EOF</code> by
returning a reference to an empty string.</p>
<p>The return value is the HTTP::Response object reference.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We will only use the callback or file argument
if <code>$response-&gt;is_success()</code>. This avoids sending content
data for redirects and authentication responses to the callback which
would be confusing.</p>
<h2>collect_once</h2>
<p>$prot-&gt;collect_once($arg, $response, $content)</p>
<p>Can be called when the whole response content is available as
content. This will invoke collect in LWP::Protocol with a collector
callback that returns a reference to <code>$content</code> the first
time and an empty string the next.</p>
