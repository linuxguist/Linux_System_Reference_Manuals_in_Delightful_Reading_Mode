<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::Object::Introspection - Dynamically create Perl language
bindings</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Glib::Object::Introspection;
Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;setup( basename =&gt; Gtk, version =&gt;
3.0, package =&gt; Gtk3); # now GtkWindow, to mention just one example,
is available as # Gtk3::Window, and you can call gtk_window_new as
Gtk3::Window-&gt;new</p>
<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Glib::Object::Introspection uses the gobject-introspection and libffi
projects to dynamically create Perl bindings for a wide variety of
libraries. Examples include gtk+, webkit, libsoup and many more.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION FOR LIBRARY USERS</h1>
<p>To allow Glib::Object::Introspection to create bindings for a
library, the library must have installed a typelib file, for example
<code>$prefix/lib/girepository-1.0/Gtk-3.0.typelib</code>. In your code
you then simply call <code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;setup</code>
with the following key-value pairs to set everything up:</p>
<dl>
<dt>basename =&gt; $basename</dt>
<dd>
<p>The basename of the library that should be wrapped. If your typelib
is called <code>Gtk-3.0.typelib</code>, then the basename is 'Gtk'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>version =&gt; $version</dt>
<dd>
<p>The particular version of the library that should be wrapped, in
string form. For <code>Gtk-3.0.typelib</code>, it is '3.0'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>package =&gt; $package</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the Perl package where every class and method of the
library should be rooted. If a library with basename 'Gtk' contains an
class 'GtkWindow', and you pick as the package 'Gtk3', then that class
will be available as 'Gtk3::Window'.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Perl wrappers created by <code>Glib::Object::Introspection</code>
follow the conventions of the Glib module and old hand-written bindings
like Gtk2. You can use the included tool <code>perli11ndoc</code> to
view the documentation of all installed libraries organized and
displayed in accordance with these conventions. The guiding principles
underlying the conventions are described in the following.</p>
<h2>Namespaces and Objects</h2>
<p>The namespaces of the C libraries are mapped to Perl packages
according to the <code>package</code> option specified, for example:</p>
<p>gtk_ =&gt; Gtk3 gdk_ =&gt; Gtk3::Gdk gdk_pixbuf_ =&gt;
Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf pango_ =&gt; Pango</p>
<p>Classes, interfaces and boxed and fundamental types get their own
namespaces, in a way, as the concept of the GType is completely replaced
in the Perl bindings by the Perl package name.</p>
<p>GtkButton =&gt; Gtk3::Button GdkPixbuf =&gt; Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf
GtkScrolledWindow =&gt; Gtk3::ScrolledWindow PangoFontDescription =&gt;
Pango::FontDescription</p>
<p>With this package mapping and Perl's built-in method lookup, the
bindings can do object casting for you. This gives us a rather
comfortably object-oriented syntax, using normal Perl object
semantics:</p>
<p>in C: GtkWidget * b; b = gtk_check_button_new_with_mnemonic
("_Something"); gtk_toggle_button_set_active (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (b),
TRUE); gtk_widget_show (b); in Perl: my $b =
Gtk3::CheckButton-&gt;new_with_mnemonic (_Something); $b-&gt;set_active
(1); $b-&gt;show;</p>
<p>You see from this that cast macros are not necessary and that you
don't need to type namespace prefixes quite so often, so your code is a
lot shorter.</p>
<h2>Flags and Enums</h2>
<p>Flags and enum values are handled as strings, because it's much more
readable than numbers, and because it's automagical thanks to the GType
system. Values are referred to by their nicknames; basically, strip the
common prefix, lower-case it, and optionally convert '_' to '-':</p>
<p>GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL =&gt; toplevel GTK_BUTTONS_OK_CANCEL =&gt;
ok-cancel (or ok_cancel)</p>
<p>Flags are a special case. You can't (sensibly) bitwise-or these
string-constants, so you provide a reference to an array of them
instead. Anonymous arrays are useful here, and an empty anonymous array
is a simple way to say 'no flags'.</p>
<p>FOO_BAR_BAZ | FOO_BAR_QUU | FOO_BAR_QUUX =&gt; [qw/baz quu qux/] 0
=&gt; []</p>
<p>In some cases you need to see if a bit is set in a bitfield; methods
returning flags therefore return an overloaded object. See Glib for more
details on which operations are allowed on these flag objects, but here
is a quick example:</p>
<p>in C: /* event-&gt;state is a bitfield */ if (event-&gt;state &amp;
GDK_CONTROL_MASK) g_printerr ("control was down\n"); in Perl: #
$event-&gt;state is a special object warn "control was down\n" if
$event-&gt;state &amp; "control-mask";</p>
<p>But this also works:</p>
<p>warn "control was down\n" if $event-&gt;state * "control-mask"; warn
"control was down\n" if $event-&gt;state &gt;= "control-mask"; warn
"control and shift were down\n" if $event-&gt;state &gt;=
["control-mask", "shift-mask"];</p>
<h2>Memory Handling</h2>
<p>The functions for ref'ing and unref'ing objects and free'ing boxed
structures are not even mapped to Perl, because it's all handled
automagically by the bindings. Objects will be kept alive so long as you
have a Perl scalar pointing to it or the object is referenced in another
way, e.g. from a container.</p>
<p>The only thing you have to be careful about is the lifespan of non
reference counted structures, which means most things derived from
<code>Glib::Boxed</code>. If it comes from a signal callback it might be
good only until you return, or if it's the insides of another object
then it might be good only while that object lives. If in doubt you can
<code>copy</code>. Structs from <code>copy</code> or <code>new</code>
are yours and live as long as referred to from Perl.</p>
<h2>Callbacks</h2>
<p>Use normal Perl callback/closure tricks with callbacks. The most
common use you'll have for callbacks is with the Glib
<code>signal_connect</code> method:</p>
<p>$widget-&gt;signal_connect (event =&gt; \&amp;event_handler,
$user_data); $button-&gt;signal_connect (clicked =&gt; sub { warn
"hi!\n" });</p>
<p><code>$user_data</code> is optional, and with Perl closures you don't
often need it (see Persistent variables with closures in perlsub).</p>
<p>The userdata is held in a scalar, initialized from what you give in
<code>signal_connect</code> etc. It's passed to the callback in usual
Perl call by reference style which means the callback can modify its
last argument, ie. <code>$_</code>[-1], to modify the held userdata.
This is a little subtle, but you can use it for some state associated
with the connection.</p>
<p>$widget-&gt;signal_connect (activate =&gt; \&amp;my_func, 1); sub
my_func { print "activation count: $_[-1]\n"; $_[-1] ++; }</p>
<p>Because the held userdata is a new scalar there's no change to the
variable (etc.) you originally passed to
<code>signal_connect</code>.</p>
<p>If you have a parent object in the userdata (or closure) you have to
be careful about circular references preventing parent and child being
destroyed. See Two-Phased Garbage Collection in perlobj about this
generally. Toplevel widgets like <code>Gtk3::Window</code> always need
an explicit <code>$widget-&gt;destroy</code> so their
<code>destroy</code> signal is a good place to break circular
references. But for other widgets it's usually friendliest to avoid
circularities in the first place, either by using weak references in the
userdata, or possibly locating a parent dynamically with
<code>$widget-&gt;get_ancestor</code>.</p>
<h2>Exception handling</h2>
<p>Anything that uses GError in C will <code>croak</code> on failure,
setting $@ to a magical exception object, which is overloaded to print
as the returned error message. The ideology here is that GError is to be
used for runtime exceptions, and <code>croak</code> is how you do that
in Perl. You can catch a croak very easily by wrapping the function in
an eval:</p>
<p>eval { my $pixbuf = Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf-&gt;new_from_file ($filename);
$image-&gt;set_from_pixbuf ($pixbuf); }; if ($@) { print "$@\n"; #
prints the possibly-localized error message if (Glib::Error::matches
($@, Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf::Error, unknown-format)) {
change_format_and_try_again (); } elsif (Glib::Error::matches ($@,
Glib::File::Error, noent)) { change_source_dir_and_try_again (); } else
{ # dont know how to handle this die $@; } }</p>
<p>This has the added advantage of letting you bunch things together as
you would with a try/throw/catch block in C++ Î©- you get cleaner code.
By using Glib::Error exception objects, you don't have to rely on string
matching on a possibly localized error message; you can match errors by
explicit and predictable conditions. See Glib::Error for more
information.</p>
<h2>Output arguments, lists, hashes</h2>
<p>In C you can only return one value from a function, and it is a
common practice to modify pointers passed in to simulate returning
multiple values. In Perl, you can return lists; any functions which
modify arguments are changed to return them instead.</p>
<p>Arguments and return values that have the types GList or GSList or
which are C arrays of values will be converted to and from references to
normal Perl arrays. The same holds for GHashTable and references to
normal Perl hashes.</p>
<h2>Object class functions</h2>
<p>Object class functions like
<code>Gtk3::WidgetClass::find_style_propery</code> can be called either
with a package name or with an instance of the package. For example:</p>
<p>Gtk3::WidgetClass::find_style_property (Gtk3::Button, image-spacing)
my $button = Gtk3::Button-&gt;new;
Gtk3::WidgetClass::find_style_property ($button, image-spacing)</p>
<h2>Overriding virtual functions</h2>
<p>When subclassing a gtk+ class or when implementing a gtk+ interface
with Glib::Object::Subclass, you can override any virtual functions that
the class has by simply defining sub routines with names obtained by
capitalizing the original names of the virtual functions. So, for
example, if you implement a custom subclass of
<code>Gtk3::CellRenderer</code> and want to override its virtual
function <code>render</code>, you provide a sub routine with the name
<code>RENDER</code> in your package.</p>
<p>sub RENDER { my ($cell, $cr, $widget, $background_area, $cell_area,
$flags) = @_; # do something }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION FOR LIBRARY BINDING AUTHORS</h1>
<h2>"Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;setup"</h2>
<p><code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;setup</code> takes a few
optional arguments that augment the generated API:</p>
<dl>
<dt>search_path =&gt; $search_path</dt>
<dd>
<p>A path that should be used when looking for typelibs. If you use
typelibs from system directories, or if your environment contains a
properly set <code>GI_TYPELIB_PATH</code> variable, then this should not
be necessary.</p>
</dd>
<dt>name_corrections =&gt; { auto_name =&gt; new_name, ... }</dt>
<dd>
<p>A hash ref that is used to rename functions and methods. Use this if
you don't like the automatically generated mapping for a function or
method. For example, if <code>g_file_hash</code> is automatically
represented as <code>Glib::IO::file_hash</code> but you want
<code>Glib::IO::File::hash</code> then pass name_corrections =&gt; {
Glib::IO::file_hash =&gt; Glib::IO::File::hash }</p>
</dd>
<dt>class_static_methods =&gt; [ function1, ... ]</dt>
<dd>
<p>An array ref of function names that you want to be treated as
class-static methods. That is, if you want be able to call
<code>Gtk3::Window::list_toplevels</code> as
<code>Gtk3::Window-&gt;list_toplevels</code>, then pass
class_static_methods =&gt; [ Gtk3::Window::list_toplevels ] The function
names refer to those after name corrections.</p>
</dd>
<dt>flatten_array_ref_return_for =&gt; [ function1, ... ]</dt>
<dd>
<p>An array ref of function names that return an array ref that you want
to be flattened so that they return plain lists. For example
flatten_array_ref_return_for =&gt; [ Gtk3::Window::list_toplevels ] The
function names refer to those after name corrections. Functions
occurring in <code>flatten_array_ref_return_for</code> may also occur in
<code>class_static_methods</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>handle_sentinel_boolean_for =&gt; [ function1, ... ]</dt>
<dd>
<p>An array ref of function names that return multiple values, the first
of which is to be interpreted as indicating whether the rest of the
returned values are valid. This frequently occurs with functions that
have out arguments; the boolean then indicates whether the out arguments
have been written. With <code>handle_sentinel_boolean_for</code>, the
first return value is taken to be the sentinel boolean. If it is true,
the rest of the original return values will be returned, and otherwise
an empty list will be returned. handle_sentinel_boolean_for =&gt; [
Gtk3::TreeSelection::get_selected ] The function names refer to those
after name corrections. Functions occurring in
<code>handle_sentinel_boolean_for</code> may also occur in
<code>class_static_methods</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>use_generic_signal_marshaller_for =&gt; [ [package1, signal1,
[arg_converter1]], ... ]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use an introspection-based generic signal marshaller for the signal
<code>signal1</code> of type <code>package1</code>. If given, use the
code reference <code>arg_converter1</code> to convert the arguments that
are passed to the signal handler. In contrast to Glib's normal signal
marshaller, the generic signal marshaller supports, among other things,
pointer arrays and out arguments.</p>
</dd>
<dt>reblessers =&gt; { package =&gt; \&amp;reblesser, ... }</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tells G:O:I to invoke <em>reblesser</em> whenever a Perl object is
created for an object of type <em>package</em>. Currently, this only
applies to boxed unions. The reblesser gets passed the pre-created Perl
object and needs to return the modified Perl object. For example: sub
Gtk3::Gdk::Event::_rebless { my ($event) = @_; return bless $event,
lookup_real_package_for ($event); }</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>"Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;invoke"</h2>
<p>To invoke specific functions manually, you can use the low-level
<code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;invoke</code>.</p>
<p>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;invoke( $basename, $namespace,
$function, @args)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$basename</code> is the basename of a library, like
'Gtk'.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$namespace</code> refers to a namespace inside that
library, like 'Window'. Use undef here if you want to call a
library-global function.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$function</code> is the name of the function you want to
invoke. It can also refer to the name of a constant.</p></li>
<li><p><code>@args</code> are the arguments that should be passed to the
function. For a method, this should include the invocant. For a
constructor, this should include the package name.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;invoke</code> returns whatever
the function being invoked returns.</p>
<h2>Overrides</h2>
<p>To override the behavior of a specific function or method, create an
appropriately named sub in the correct package and have it call
<code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;invoke</code>. Say you want to
override <code>Gtk3::Window::list_toplevels</code>, then do this:</p>
<p>sub Gtk3::Window::list_toplevels { # ...do something... my $ref =
Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;invoke ( Gtk, Window, list_toplevels,
@_); # ...do something... return wantarray ? @$ref : $ref-&gt;[$#$ref];
}</p>
<p>The sub's name and package must be those after name corrections.</p>
<h2>Converting a Perl variable to a GValue</h2>
<p>If you need to marshal into a GValue, then
Glib::Object::Introspection cannot do this automatically because the
type information is missing. If you do have this information in your
module, however, you can use Glib::Object::Introspection::GValueWrapper
to do the conversion. In the wrapper for a function that expects a
GValue, do this:</p>
<p>... my $type = ...; # somehow get the package name that # corresponds
to the correct GType my $wrapper =
Glib::Object::Introspection::GValueWrapper-&gt;new ($type, $value); #
now use Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;invoke and # substitute $wrapper
where youd use $value ...</p>
<p>If you need to call a function that expects an already set-up GValue
and modifies it, use <code>get_value</code> on the wrapper afterwards to
obtain the value. For example:</p>
<p>my $wrapper = Glib::Object::Introspection::GValueWrapper-&gt;new
(Glib::Boolean, 0); $box-&gt;child_get_property ($label, expand,
$gvalue); my $value = $gvalue-&gt;get_value</p>
<h2>Handling raw enumerations and flags</h2>
<p>If you need to handle raw enumerations/flags or extendable
enumerations for which more than the pre-defined values might be valid,
then use
<code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_enum_to_sv</code>,
<code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_sv_to_enum</code>,
<code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_flags_to_sv</code> and
<code>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_sv_to_flags</code>. They
will raise an exception on unknown values; catching it then allows you
to implement fallback behavior.</p>
<p>Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_enum_to_sv (package,
enum_value) Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_sv_to_enum (package,
sv) Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_flags_to_sv (package,
flags_value) Glib::Object::Introspection-&gt;convert_sv_to_flags
(package, sv)</p>
