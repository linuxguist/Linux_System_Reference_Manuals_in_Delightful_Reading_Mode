FHs in standard OO interface ERYQ ::WrapTie adpO Tie your handles &amp;
retain full OO interface ERYQ</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both
traditional and object-oriented i/o) on things <em>other</em> than
normal filehandles; in particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and
IO::Lines.</p>
<p>In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have IO::AtomicFile
which may be used to painlessly create files which are updated
atomically.</p>
<p>And in the this-may-prove-useful corner, we have IO::Wrap, whose
exported <strong>wraphandle()</strong> function will clothe anything
that's not a blessed object in an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can
just use OO syntax and stop worrying about whether your function's
caller handed you a string, a globref, or a FileHandle.</p>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p>Perl's TIEHANDLE spec was incomplete prior to 5.005_57; it was
missing support for <code>seek()</code>, <code>tell()</code>, and
<code>eof()</code>. Attempting to use these functions with an
IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, IO::Lines, etc. <strong>will not
work</strong> prior to 5.005_57. None of the relevant methods will be
invoked by Perl; and even worse, this kind of bug can lie dormant for a
while. If you turn warnings on (via <code>$^W</code> or
<code>perl -w</code>), and you see something like this...</p>
<p>seek() on unopened file</p>
<p>...then you are probably trying to use one of these functions on one
of our IO:: classes with an old Perl. The remedy is to simply use the OO
version; e.g.:</p>
<p>$SH-&gt;seek(0,0); ### GOOD: will work on any 5.005 seek($SH,0,0);
### WARNING: will only work on 5.005_57 and beyond</p>
<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>As of version 2.x, this toolkit requires Perl 5.005 for the
IO::Handle subclasses, and 5.005_57 or better is
<strong>strongly</strong> recommended. See WARNINGS for details.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Most of you already know the drill...</p>
<p>perl Makefile.PL make make test make install</p>
<p>For everyone else out there... if you've never installed Perl code
before, or you're trying to use this in an environment where your
sysadmin or ISP won't let you do interesting things,
<strong>relax:</strong> since this module contains no binary extensions,
you can cheat. That means copying the directory tree under my ./lib
directory into someplace where your script can see it. For example,
under Linux:</p>
<p>cp -r IO-stringy-1.234/lib/* /path/to/my/perl/</p>
<p>Now, in your Perl code, do this:</p>
<p>use lib "/path/to/my/perl"; use IO::Scalar; ### or whatever</p>
<p>Ok, now you've been told. At this point, anyone who whines about not
being given enough information gets an unflattering haiku written about
them in the next change log. I'll do it. Don't think I won't.</p>

<h1>TO DO</h1>
<dl>
<dt>(2000/08/02) Finalize $/ support</dt>
<dd>
<p>Graham Barr submitted this patch half a <em>year</em> ago; Like a
moron, I lost his message under a ton of others, and only now have the
experimental implementation done. Will the sudden sensitivity to $/ hose
anyone out there? I'm worried, so you have to enable it explicitly in
1.x. It will be on by default in 2.x, though only IO::Scalar has been
implemented.</p>
</dd>
<dt>(2001/08/08) Remove IO::WrapTie from new IO:: classes</dt>
<dd>
<p>It's not needed. Backwards compatibility could be maintained by
having <strong>new_tie()</strong> be identical to
<strong>new()</strong>. Heck, I'll bet that IO::WrapTie should be
reimplemented so the returned object is just like an IO::Scalar in its
use of globrefs.</p>
</dd>

*.html in lib/ 4369 Improvement: handling of fixed-size reads in
IO::Scalar (Actually, bug 4369 was closed in Version 2.109)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 2.109 (2003/12/21)</dt>
<dd>
<p>IO::Scalar::getline now works with ref to int. <em>Thanks to
Dominique Quatravaux for this patch.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 2.108 (2001/08/20)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The terms-of-use have been placed in the distribution file COPYING.
Also, small documentation tweaks were made.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 2.105 (2001/08/09)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Added support for various <strong>seek()</strong> whences to
IO::ScalarArray. Added support for consulting $/ in IO::Scalar and
IO::ScalarArray. The old <code>use_RS()</code> is not even an option.
Unsupported record separators will cause a <strong>croak()</strong>.
Added a lot of regression tests to supoprt the above. Better on-line
docs (hyperlinks to individual functions).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 2.103 (2001/08/08)</dt>
<dd>
<p>After sober consideration I have reimplemented
<strong>IO::Scalar::print()</strong> so that it once again always seeks
to the end of the string. Benchmarks show the new implementation to be
just as fast as Juergen's contributed patch; until someone can convince
me otherwise, the current, safer implementation stays. I thought more
about giving IO::Scalar two separate handles, one for reading and one
for writing, as suggested by Binkley. His points about what
<strong>tell()</strong> and <strong>eof()</strong> return are, I think,
show-stoppers for this feature. Even the manpages for stdio's
<strong>fseek()</strong> seem to imply a <em>single</em> file position
indicator, not two. So I think I will take this off the TO DO list.
<strong>Remedy:</strong> you can always have two handles open on the
same scalar, one which you only write to, and one which you only read
from. That should give the same effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 2.101 (2001/08/07)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Alpha release.</strong> This is the initial release of the
IO::Scalar and friends are now subclasses of IO::Handle. I'm flinging it
against the wall. Please tell me if the banana sticks. When it does, the
banana will be called 2.2x. First off, <em>many many thanks to Doug
Wilson</em>, who has provided an <em>invaluable</em> service by patching
IO::Scalar and friends so that they (1) inherit from IO::Handle, (2)
automatically tie themselves so that the <code>new()</code> objects can
be used in native i/o constructs, and (3) doing it so that the whole
damn thing passes its regression tests. As Doug knows, my globref
Kung-Fu was not up to the task; he graciously provided the patches. This
has earned him a seat at the Co-Authors table, and the right to have me
address him as <em>sensei</em>. Performance of
<strong>IO::Scalar::print()</strong> has been improved by as much as 2x
for lots of little prints, with the cost of forcing those who
print-then-seek-then-print to explicitly seek to end-of-string before
printing again. <em>Thanks to Juergen Zeller for this patch.</em> Added
the COPYING file, which had been missing from prior versions. <em>Thanks
to Albert Chin-A-Young for pointing this out.</em> IO::Scalar consults
$/ by default (1.x ignored it by default). Yes, I still need to support
IO::ScalarArray.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.221 (2001/08/07)</dt>
<dd>
<p>I threatened in INSTALLATION to write an unflattering haiku about
anyone who whined that I gave them insufficient information... but it
turns out that I left out a crucial direction. D'OH! <em>Thanks to David
Beroff for the patch and the haiku...</em> Enough info there? Heres
unflattering haiku: Forgot the line, "make"! ;-)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.220 (2001/04/03)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Added untested SEEK, TELL, and EOF methods to IO::Scalar and
IO::ScalarArray to support corresponding functions for tied filehandles:
untested, because I'm still running 5.00556 and Perl is complaining
about <strong>tell()</strong> on unopened file. <em>Thanks to Graham
Barr for the suggestion.</em> Removed not-fully-blank lines from
modules; these were causing lots of POD-related warnings. <em>Thanks to
Nicolas Joly for the suggestion.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.219 (2001/02/23)</dt>
<dd>
<p>IO::Scalar objects can now be made sensitive to $/ . Pains were taken
to keep the fast code fast while adding this feature. <em>Cheers to
Graham Barr for submitting his patch;</em> jeers to me for losing his
email for 6 months.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.218 (2001/02/23)</dt>
<dd>
<p>IO::Scalar has a new <strong>sysseek()</strong> method. <em>Thanks
again to Richard Jones.</em> New TO DO section, because people who
submit patches/ideas should at least know that they're in the system...
and that I won't lose their stuff. Please read it. New entries in
AUTHOR. Please read those too.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.216 (2000/09/28)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>IO::Scalar and IO::ScalarArray now inherit from
IO::Handle.</strong> I thought I'd remembered a problem with this ages
ago, related to the fact that these IO:: modules don't have real
filehandles, but the problem apparently isn't surfacing now. If you
suddenly encounter Perl warnings during global destruction (especially
if you're using tied filehandles), then please let me know! <em>Thanks
to B. K. Oxley (binkley) for this.</em> <strong>Nasty bug fixed in
IO::Scalar::write().</strong> Apparently, the offset and the
number-of-bytes arguments were, for all practical purposes,
<em>reversed.</em> You were okay if you did all your writing with
<strong>print()</strong>, but boy was <em>this</em> a stupid bug!
<em>Thanks to Richard Jones for finding this one.</em> For you, Rich, a
double-length haiku: Newspaper headline typeset by dyslexic man loses
urgency BABY EATS FISH is simply not equivalent to FISH EATS BABY
<strong>New sysread and syswrite methods for IO::Scalar.</strong>
<em>Thanks again to Richard Jones for this.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.215 (2000/09/05)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Added 'bool' overload to '""' overload, so object always evaluates to
true. (Whew. Glad I caught this before it went to CPAN.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.214 (2000/09/03)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Evaluating an IO::Scalar in a string context now yields the
underlying string. <em>Thanks to B. K. Oxley (binkley) for
this.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.213 (2000/08/16)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Minor documentation fixes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.212 (2000/06/02)</dt>

many folks for reporting this.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.210 (2000/04/17)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Added <strong>flush()</strong> and other no-op methods. <em>Thanks to
Doru Petrescu for suggesting this.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.209 (2000/03/17)</dt>
