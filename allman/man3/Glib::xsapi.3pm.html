<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::xsapi - internal API reference for GPerl.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;gperl.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This is the binding developer's API reference for GPerl,
automatically generated from the xs source files. This header defines
the public interface for use when creating new Perl language bindings
for GLib-based C libraries.</p>
<p>gperl.h includes for you all the headers needed for writing XSUBs
(EXTERN.h, perl.h, and XSUB.h), as well as all of GLib (via
glib-object.h).</p>
<h1>API</h1>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Various useful utilities defined in Glib.xs.</p>
<dl>
<dt>GPERL_CALL_BOOT(name)</dt>
<dd>
<p>call the boot code of a module by symbol rather than by name. in a
perl extension which uses several xs files but only one pm, you need to
bootstrap the other xs files in order to get their functions exported to
perl. if the file has MODULE = Foo::Bar, the boot symbol would be
boot_Foo_â€†_Bar.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void _gperl_call_XS (pTHX_ void (*subaddr) (pTHX_ CV *), CV * cv, SV
** mark);</dt>
<dd>
<p>never use this function directly. see <code>GPERL_CALL_BOOT</code>.
for the curious, this calls a perl sub by function pointer rather than
by name; call_sv requires that the xsub already be registered, but we
need this to call a function which will register xsubs. this is an evil
hack and should not be used outside of the GPERL_CALL_BOOT macro. it's
implemented as a function to avoid code size bloat, and exported so that
extension modules can pull the same trick.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gpointer gperl_alloc_temp (int nbytes)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Allocate and return a pointer to an <em>nbytes</em>-long,
zero-initialized, temporary buffer that will be reaped at the next
garbage collection sweep. This is handy for allocating things that need
to be alloc'ed before a croak (since croak doesn't return and give you
the chance to free them). The trick is that the memory is allocated in a
mortal perl scalar. See the perl online manual for notes on using this
technique. Do <strong>not</strong> under any circumstances attempt to
call <strong>g_free()</strong>, <strong>free()</strong>, or any other
deallocator on this pointer, or you will crash the interpreter.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gchar *gperl_filename_from_sv (SV *sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return a localized version of the filename in the sv, using
g_filename_from_utf8 (and consequently this function might croak). The
memory is allocated using gperl_alloc_temp.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV *gperl_sv_from_filename (const gchar *filename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Convert the filename into an utf8 string as used by gtk/glib and
perl.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gboolean gperl_str_eq (const char * a, const char * b);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Compare a pair of ascii strings, considering '-' and '_' to be
equivalent. Used for things like enum value nicknames and signal
names.</p>
</dd>
<dt>guint gperl_str_hash (gconstpointer key)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like <strong>g_str_hash()</strong>, but considers '-' and '_' to be
equivalent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPerlArgv * gperl_argv_new ()</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a new Perl argv object whose members can then be passed to
functions that request argc and argv style arguments. If the called
function(s) modified argv, you can call gperl_argv_update to update
Perl's <code>@ARGV</code> in the same way. Remember to call
gperl_argv_free when you're done.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_argv_update (GPerlArgv *pargv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Updates <code>@ARGV</code> to resemble the stored argv array.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_argv_free (GPerlArgv *pargv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Frees any resources associated with <em>pargv</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>char * gperl_format_variable_for_output (SV * sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Formats the variable stored in <em>sv</em> for output in error
messages. Like <strong>SvPV_nolen()</strong>, but ellipsizes real
strings (i.e., not stringified references) at 20 chars to trim things
down for error messages.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gboolean gperl_sv_is_defined (SV *sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks the SV <em>sv</em> for definedness just like Perl's
<em><strong>defined()</strong></em> would do. Most importantly, it
correctly handles magical SVs, unlike bare <em>SvOK</em>. It's also
NULL-safe.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_hv_take_sv (HV *hv, const char *key, size_t key_length,
SV *sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tries to store <em>sv</em> in <em>hv</em>. Decreases <em>sv</em>'s
reference count if something goes wrong.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GError Exception Objects</h2>
<p>GError is a facility for propagating run-time error / exception
information around in C, which is a language without native support for
exceptions. GError uses a simple error code, usually defined as an enum.
Since the enums will overlap, GError includes the GQuark corresponding
to a particular error domain to tell you which error codes will be used.
There's also a string containing a specific error message. The strings
are arbitrary, and may be translated, but the domains and codes are
definite.</p>
<p>Perl has native support for exceptions, using <code>eval</code> as
try, <code>croak</code> or <code>die</code> as throw, and
<code>if ($@)</code> as catch. <code>$@</code> may, in fact, be any
scalar, including blessed objects.</p>
<p>So, GPerl maps GLib's GError to Perl exceptions.</p>
<p>Since, as we described above, error messages are not guaranteed to be
unique everywhere, we need to support the use of the error domains and
codes. The obvious choice here is to use exception objects; however, to
support blessed exception objects, we must perform a little bit of black
magic in the bindings. There is no built-in association between an error
domain quark and the GType of the corresponding error code enumeration,
so the bindings supply both of these when specifying the name of the
package into which to bless exceptions of this domain. All GError-based
exceptions derive from Glib::Error, of course, and this base class
provides all of the functionality, including stringification.</p>
<p>All you'll really ever need to do is register error domains with
<code>gperl_register_error_domain</code>, and throw errors with
<code>gperl_croak_gerror</code>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>void gperl_register_error_domain (GQuark domain, GType error_enum,
const char * package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tell the bindings to bless GErrors with error-&gt;domain ==
<em>domain</em> into <em>package</em>, and use <em>error_enum</em> to
find the nicknames for the error codes. This will call
<code>gperl_set_isa</code> on <em>package</em> to add Glib::Error to
<em>package</em>'s <code>@ISA</code>. <em>domain</em> may not be 0, and
<em>package</em> may not be NULL; what would be the point?
<em>error_enum</em> may be 0, in which case you'll get no fancy
stringified error values.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_sv_from_gerror (GError * error)</dt>
<dd>
<p>You should rarely, if ever, need to call this function. This is what
turns a GError into a Perl object.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gperl_gerror_from_sv (SV * sv, GError ** error)</dt>
<dd>
<p>You should rarely need this function. This parses a perl data
structure into a GError. If <em>sv</em> is undef (or the empty string),
sets *<em>error</em> to NULL, otherwise, allocates a new GError with
<code>g_error_new_literal()</code> and writes through <em>error</em>;
the caller is responsible for calling <code>g_error_free()</code>.
(<strong>gperl_croak_gerror()</strong> does this, for example.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_croak_gerror (const char * ignored, GError * err)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Croak with an exception based on <em>err</em>. <em>err</em> may not
be NULL. <em>ignored</em> exists for backward compatibility, and is,
well, ignored. This function calls <strong>croak()</strong>, which does
not return. Since <strong>croak()</strong> does not return, this
function handles the magic behind not leaking the memory associated with
the #GError. To use this you'd do something like PREINIT: GError * error
= NULL; CODE: if (!funtion_that_can_fail (something, &amp;error))
gperl_croak_gerror (NULL, error); It's just that simple!</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GLog</h2>
<p>GLib has a message logging mechanism which it uses for the
<strong>g_return_if_fail()</strong> assertion macros, etc.; it's really
versatile and allows you to set various levels to be fatal and whatnot.
Libraries use these for various types of message reporting.</p>
<p>These functions let you reroute those messages from Perl. By default,
the warning, critical, and message levels go through perl's
<strong>warn()</strong>, and fatal ones go through
<strong>croak()</strong>. [i'm not sure that these get to
<strong>croak()</strong> before GLib <strong>abort()</strong>s on
them...]</p>
<dl>
<dt>gint gperl_handle_logs_for (const gchar * log_domain)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Route all g_logs for <em>log_domain</em> through gperl's log
handling. You'll have to register domains in each binding submodule,
because there's no way we can know about them down here. And,
technically, this traps all the predefined log levels, not any of the
ones you (or your library) may define for yourself.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GType / GEnum / GFlags</h2>
<dl>
<dt>void gperl_register_fundamental (GType gtype, const char *
package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>register a mapping between <em>gtype</em> and <em>package</em>. this
is for fundamental types which have no other requirements for metadata
storage, such as GEnums, GFlags, or real GLib fundamental types like
G_TYPE_INT, G_TYPE_FLOAT, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_register_fundamental_alias (GType gtype, const char *
package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes <em>package</em> an alias for <em>type</em>. This means that
the package name specified by <em>package</em> will be mapped to
<em>type</em> by <em>gperl_fundamental_type_from_package</em>, but
<em>gperl_fundamental_package_from_type</em> won't map <em>type</em> to
<em>package</em>. This is useful if you want to change the canonical
package name of a type while preserving backwards compatibility with
code which uses <em>package</em> to specify <em>type</em>. In order for
this to make sense, another package name should be registered for
<em>type</em> with <em>gperl_register_fundamental</em> or
<em>gperl_register_fundamental_full</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPerlValueWrapperClass</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the vtable that is to be used to convert fundamental types
to and from Perl variables. typedef struct _GPerlValueWrapperClass
GPerlValueWrapperClass; struct _GPerlValueWrapperClass {
GPerlValueWrapFunc wrap; GPerlValueUnwrapFunc unwrap; }; The members are
function pointers, each of which serves a specific purpose:</p>
<dl>
<dt>GPerlValueWrapFunc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns <em>value</em> into an SV. The caller assumes ownership of the
SV. <em>value</em> is not to be modified. typedef SV*
(*GPerlValueWrapFunc) (const GValue * value);</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPerlValueUnwrapFunc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns <em>sv</em> into its fundamental representation and stores the
result in the pre-configured <em>value</em>. <em>value</em> must not be
overwritten; instead one of the various <code>g_value_set_*()</code>
functions must be used or the <code>value-&gt;data</code> pointer must
be modified directly. typedef void (*GPerlValueUnwrapFunc) (GValue *
value, SV * sv);</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_register_fundamental_full (GType gtype, const char *
package, GPerlValueWrapperClass * wrapper_class)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like gperl_register_fundamental, registers a mapping between
<em>gtype</em> and <em>package</em>. In addition, this also installs the
function pointers in <em>wrapper_class</em> as the handlers for the
type. See GPerlValueWrapperClass.
<em>gperl_register_fundamental_full</em> does not copy the contents of
<em>wrapper_class</em> Î©- it assumes that <em>wrapper_class</em> is
statically allocated and that it will be valid for the whole lifetime of
the program.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GType gperl_fundamental_type_from_package (const char *
package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>look up the GType corresponding to a <em>package</em> registered by
<strong>gperl_register_fundamental()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>const char * gperl_fundamental_package_from_type (GType gtype)</dt>
<dd>
<p>look up the package corresponding to a <em>gtype</em> registered by
<strong>gperl_register_fundamental()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPerlValueWrapperClass * gperl_fundamental_wrapper_class_from_type
(GType gtype)</dt>
<dd>
<p>look up the wrapper class corresponding to a <em>gtype</em> that has
previously been registered with
<strong>gperl_register_fundamental_full()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gboolean gperl_try_convert_enum (GType gtype, SV * sv, gint *
val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>return FALSE if <em>sv</em> can't be mapped to a valid member of the
registered enum type <em>gtype</em>; otherwise, return TRUE write the
new value to the int pointed to by <em>val</em>. you'll need this only
in esoteric cases.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gint gperl_convert_enum (GType type, SV * val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>croak if <em>val</em> is not part of <em>type</em>, otherwise return
corresponding value</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_convert_back_enum_pass_unknown (GType type, gint
val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>return a scalar containing the nickname of the enum value
<em>val</em>, or the integer value of <em>val</em> if <em>val</em> is
not a member of the enum <em>type</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_convert_back_enum (GType type, gint val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>return a scalar which is the nickname of the enum value val, or croak
if val is not a member of the enum.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gboolean gperl_try_convert_flag (GType type, const char * val_p,
gint * val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>like <strong>gperl_try_convert_enum()</strong>, but for GFlags.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gint gperl_convert_flag_one (GType type, const char * val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>croak if <em>val</em> is not part of <em>type</em>, otherwise return
corresponding value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gint gperl_convert_flags (GType type, SV * val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>collapse a list of strings to an integer with all the correct bits
set, croak if anything is invalid.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_convert_back_flags (GType type, gint val)</dt>
<dd>
<p>convert a bitfield to a list of strings.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Inheritance management</h2>
<dl>
<dt>void gperl_set_isa (const char * child_package, const char *
parent_package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>tell perl that <em>child_package</em> inherits
<em>parent_package</em>, after whatever else is already there.
equivalent to
<code>push @{$parent_package}::ISA, $child_package;</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_prepend_isa (const char * child_package, const char *
parent_package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>tell perl that <em>child_package</em> inherits
<em>parent_package</em>, but before whatever else is already there.
equivalent to
<code>unshift @{$parent_package}::ISA, $child_package;</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>GType gperl_type_from_package (const char * package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Look up the GType associated with <em>package</em>, regardless of how
it was registered. Returns 0 if no mapping can be found.</p>
</dd>
<dt>const char * gperl_package_from_type (GType gtype)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Look up the name of the package associated with <em>gtype</em>,
regardless of how it was registered. Returns NULL if no mapping can be
found.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Boxed type support for SV</h2>
<p>In order to allow GValues to hold perl SVs we need a GBoxed
wrapper.</p>
<dl>
<dt>GPERL_TYPE_SV</dt>
<dd>
<p>Evaluates to the GType for SVs. The bindings register a mapping
between GPERL_TYPE_SV and the package 'Glib::Scalar' with
<strong>gperl_register_boxed()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_sv_copy (SV * sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>implemented as <code>newSVsv (sv)</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_sv_free (SV * sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>implemented as <code>SvREFCNT_dec (sv)</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>UTF-8 strings with gchar</h2>
<p>By convention, gchar* is assumed to point to UTF8 string data, and
char* points to ascii string data. Here we define a pair of wrappers for
the boilerplate of upgrading Perl strings. They are implemented as
functions rather than macros, because comma expressions in macros are
not supported by all compilers.</p>
<p>These functions should be used instead of newSVpv and SvPV_nolen in
all cases which deal with gchar* types.</p>
<dl>
<dt>gchar * SvGChar (SV * sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>extract a UTF8 string from <em>sv</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * newSVGChar (const gchar * str)</dt>
<dd>
<p>copy a UTF8 string into a new SV. if str is NULL, returns
&amp;PL_sv_undef.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>64 bit integers</h2>
<p>On 32 bit machines and even on some 64 bit machines, perl's IV/UV
data type can only hold 32 bit values. The following functions therefore
convert 64 bit integers to and from Perl strings if normal IV/UV
conversion does not suffice.</p>
<dl>
<dt>gint64 SvGInt64 (SV *sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Converts the string in <em>sv</em> to a signed 64 bit integer. If
appropriate, uses <code>SvIV</code> instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * newSVGInt64 (gint64 value)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a PV from the signed 64 bit integer in <em>value</em>. If
appropriate, uses <code>newSViv</code> instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt>guint64 SvGUInt64 (SV *sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Converts the string in <em>sv</em> to an unsigned 64 bit integer. If
appropriate, uses <code>SvUV</code> instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * newSVGUInt64 (guint64 value)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a PV from the unsigned 64 bit integer in <em>value</em>. If
appropriate, uses <code>newSVuv</code> instead.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GBoxed</h2>
<dl>
<dt>GPerlBoxedWrapperClass</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the vtable of functions to be used for bringing boxed types
in and out of perl. The structure is defined like this: typedef struct
_GPerlBoxedWrapperClass GPerlBoxedWrapperClass; struct
_GPerlBoxedWrapperClass { GPerlBoxedWrapFunc wrap; GPerlBoxedUnwrapFunc
unwrap; GPerlBoxedDestroyFunc destroy; }; The members are function
pointers, each of which serves a specific purpose:</p>
<dl>
<dt>GPerlBoxedWrapFunc</dt>
<dd>
<p>turn a boxed pointer into an SV. gtype is the type of the boxed
pointer, and package is the package to which that gtype is registered
(the lookup has already been done for you at this point). if own is
true, the wrapper is responsible for freeing the object; if it is false,
some other code owns the object and you must NOT free it. typedef SV*
(*GPerlBoxedWrapFunc) (GType gtype, const char * package, gpointer
boxed, gboolean own);</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPerlBoxedUnwrapFunc</dt>
<dd>
<p>turn an SV into a boxed pointer. like GPerlBoxedWrapFunc, gtype and
package are the registered type pair, already looked up for you (in the
process of finding the proper wrapper class). sv is the sv to unwrap.
typedef gpointer (*GPerlBoxedUnwrapFunc) (GType gtype, const char *
package, SV * sv);</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPerlBoxedDestroyFunc</dt>
<dd>
<p>this will be called by Glib::Boxed::DESTROY, when the wrapper is
destroyed. it is a hook that allows you to destroy an object owned by
the wrapper; note, however, that you will have had to keep track
yourself of whether the object was to be freed. typedef void
(*GPerlBoxedDestroyFunc) (SV * sv);</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_register_boxed (GType gtype, const char * package,
GPerlBoxedWrapperClass * wrapper_class)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Register a mapping between the GBoxed derivative <em>gtype</em> and
<em>package</em>. The specified, <em>wrapper_class</em> will be used to
wrap and unwrap objects of this type; you may pass NULL to use the
default wrapper (the same one returned by
<strong>gperl_default_boxed_wrapper_class()</strong>). In normal usage,
the standard opaque wrapper supplied by the library is sufficient and
correct. In some cases, however, you want a boxed type to map directly
to a native perl type; for example, some struct may be more
appropriately represented as a hash in perl. Since the most necessary
place for this conversion to happen is in
<strong>gperl_value_from_sv()</strong> and
<strong>gperl_sv_from_value()</strong>, the only reliable and robust way
to implement this is a hook into
<strong>gperl_get_boxed_check()</strong> and
<strong>gperl_new_boxed()</strong>; that is exactly the purpose of
<em>wrapper_class</em>. See <code>GPerlBoxedWrapperClass</code>.
<em>gperl_register_boxed</em> does not copy the contents of
<em>wrapper_class</em> Î©- it assumes that <em>wrapper_class</em> is
statically allocated and that it will be valid for the whole lifetime of
the program.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_register_boxed_alias (GType gtype, const char *
package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes <em>package</em> an alias for <em>type</em>. This means that
the package name specified by <em>package</em> will be mapped to
<em>type</em> by <em>gperl_boxed_type_from_package</em>, but
<em>gperl_boxed_package_from_type</em> won't map <em>type</em> to
<em>package</em>. This is useful if you want to change the canonical
package name of a type while preserving backwards compatibility with
code which uses <em>package</em> to specify <em>type</em>. In order for
this to make sense, another package name should be registered for
<em>type</em> with <em>gperl_register_boxed</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_register_boxed_synonym (GType registered_gtype, GType
synonym_gtype)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Registers <em>synonym_gtype</em> as a synonym for
<em>registered_gtype</em>. All boxed objects of type
<em>synonym_gtype</em> will then be treated as if they were of type
<em>registered_gtype</em>, and <em>gperl_boxed_package_from_type</em>
will return the package associated with <em>registered_gtype</em>.
<em>registered_gtype</em> must have been registered with
<em>gperl_register_boxed</em> already.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GType gperl_boxed_type_from_package (const char * package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Look up the GType associated with package <em>package</em>. Returns 0
if <em>type</em> is not registered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>const char * gperl_boxed_package_from_type (GType type)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Look up the package associated with GBoxed derivative <em>type</em>.
Returns NULL if <em>type</em> is not registered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPerlBoxedWrapperClass * gperl_default_boxed_wrapper_class
(void)</dt>
<dd>
<p>get a pointer to the default wrapper class; handy if you want to use
the normal wrapper, with minor modifications. note that you can just
pass NULL to <strong>gperl_register_boxed()</strong>, so you really only
need this in fringe cases.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_new_boxed (gpointer boxed, GType gtype, gboolean
own)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Export a GBoxed derivative to perl, according to whatever
GPerlBoxedWrapperClass is registered for <em>gtype</em>. In the default
implementation, this means wrapping an opaque perl object around the
pointer to a small wrapper structure which stores some metadata, such as
whether the boxed structure should be destroyed when the wrapper is
destroyed (controlled by <em>own</em>; if the wrapper owns the object,
the wrapper is in charge of destroying it's data). This function might
end up calling other Perl code, so if you use it in XS code for a
generic GType, make sure the stack pointer is set up correctly before
the call, and restore it after the call.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_new_boxed_copy (gpointer boxed, GType gtype)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a new copy of <em>boxed</em> and return an owner wrapper for
it. <em>boxed</em> may not be NULL. See
<code>gperl_new_boxed</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gpointer gperl_get_boxed_check (SV * sv, GType gtype)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Extract the boxed pointer from a wrapper; croaks if the wrapper
<em>sv</em> is not blessed into a derivative of the expected
<em>gtype</em>. Does not allow undef.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GObject</h2>
<p>To deal with the intricate interaction of the different
reference-counting semantics of Perl objects versus GObjects, the
bindings create a combined PerlObject+GObject, with the GObject's
pointer in magic attached to the Perl object, and the Perl object's
pointer in the GObject's user data. Thus it's not really a wrapper, but
we refer to it as one, because combined Perl object + GObject is a
cumbersome and confusing mouthful.</p>
<p>GObjects are represented as blessed hash references. The GObject user
data mechanism is not typesafe, and thus is used only for unsigned
integer values; the Perl-level hash is available for any type of user
data. The combined nature of the wrapper means that data stored in the
hash will stick around as long as the object is alive.</p>
<p>Since the C pointer is stored in attached magic, the C pointer is not
available to the Perl developer via the hash object, so there's no need
to worry about breaking it from perl.</p>
<p>Propers go to Marc Lehmann for dreaming most of this up.</p>
<dl>
<dt>void gperl_register_object (GType gtype, const char * package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>tell the GPerl type subsystem what Perl package corresponds with a
given GObject by GType. automagically sets up @<em>package</em>::ISA for
you. note that <code>@ISA</code> will not be created for gtype until
gtype's parent has been registered. if you are experiencing strange
problems with a class' <code>@ISA</code> not being set up, change the
order in which you register them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_register_object_alias (GType gtype, const char *
package)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes <em>package</em> an alias for <em>type</em>. This means that
the package name specified by <em>package</em> will be mapped to
<em>type</em> by <em>gperl_object_type_from_package</em>, but
<em>gperl_object_package_from_type</em> won't map <em>type</em> to
<em>package</em>. This is useful if you want to change the canonical
package name of a type while preserving backwards compatibility with
code which uses <em>package</em> to specify <em>type</em>. In order for
this to make sense, another package name should be registered for
<em>type</em> with <em>gperl_register_object</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_register_sink_func (GType gtype, GPerlObjectSinkFunc
func)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tell <strong>gperl_new_object()</strong> to use <em>func</em> to
claim ownership of objects derived from <em>gtype</em>.
<strong>gperl_new_object()</strong> always refs a GObject when wrapping
it for the first time. To have the Perl wrapper claim ownership of a
GObject as part of <strong>gperl_new_object()</strong>, you unref the
object after ref'ing it. however, different GObject subclasses have
different ways to claim ownership; for example, GtkObject simply
requires you to call <strong>gtk_object_sink()</strong>. To make this
concept generic, this function allows you to register a function to be
called when then wrapper should claim ownership of the object. The
<em>func</em> registered for a given <em>type</em> will be called on any
object for which <code>g_type_isa</code> (G_TYPE_OBJECT (object), type)
succeeds. If no sinkfunc is found for an object,
<strong>g_object_unref()</strong> will be used. Even though GObjects
don't need sink funcs, we need to have them in Glib as a hook for
upstream objects. If we create a GtkObject (or any other type of object
which uses a different way to claim ownership) via Glib::Object-&gt;new,
any upstream wrappers, such as <strong>gtk2perl_new_object()</strong>,
will <strong>not</strong> be called. Having a sink func facility down
here enables us always to do the right thing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_object_set_no_warn_unreg_subclass (GType gtype, gboolean
nowarn)</dt>
<dd>
<p>In versions 1.00 through 1.10x of Glib, the bindings required all
types to be registered ahead of time. Upon encountering an unknown type,
the bindings would emit a warning to the effect of unknown type 'Foo';
representing as first known parent type 'Bar'. However, for some types,
such as GtkStyle or GdkGC, the actual object returned is an instance of
a child type of a private implementation (e.g., a theme engine
(BlueCurveStyle) or gdk backend (GdkGCX11)); we neither can nor should
have registered names for these types. Therefore, it is possible to tell
the bindings not to warn about these unregistered subclasses, and simply
represent them as the parent type. With 1.12x, the bindings will
automatically register unknown classes into the namespace
Glib::Object::_Unregistered to avoid possible breakage resulting from
unknown ancestors of known children. To preserve the old
registered-as-unregistered behavior, the value installed by this
function is used to prevent the _Unregistered mapping for such private
backend classes. Note: this assumes <em>gtype</em> has already been
registered with <strong>gperl_register_object()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>const char * gperl_object_package_from_type (GType gtype)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Get the package corresponding to <em>gtype</em>. If <em>gtype</em> is
not a GObject or GInterface, returns NULL. If <em>gtype</em> is not
registered to a package name, a new name of the form
<code>Glib::Object::_Unregistered::$c_type_name</code> will be created,
used to register the class, and then returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HV * gperl_object_stash_from_type (GType gtype)</dt>

</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_new_object (GObject * object, gboolean own)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this function to get the perl part of a GObject. If
<em>object</em> has never been seen by perl before, a new, empty perl
object will be created and added to a private key under
<em>object</em>'s qdata. If <em>object</em> already has a perl part, a
new reference to it will be created. The gobject + perl object together
form a combined object that is properly refcounted, i.e. both parts will
stay alive as long as at least one of them is alive, and only when both
perl object and gobject are no longer referenced will both be freed. The
perl object will be blessed into the package corresponding to the GType
returned by calling <strong>G_OBJECT_TYPE()</strong> on <em>object</em>;
if that class has not been registered via
<strong>gperl_register_object()</strong>, this function will emit a
warning to that effect (with <strong>warn()</strong>), and attempt to
bless it into the first known class in the object's ancestry. Since
Glib::Object is already registered, you'll get a Glib::Object if you are
lazy, and thus this function can fail only if <em>object</em> isn't
descended from GObject, in which case it croaks. (In reality, if you
pass a non-GObject to this function, you'll be lucky if you don't get a
segfault, as there's not really a way to trap that.) In practice these
warnings can be unavoidable, so you can use
<strong>gperl_object_set_no_warn_unreg_subclass()</strong> to quell them
on a class-by-class basis. However, when perl code is calling a GObject
constructor (any function which returns a new GObject), call
<strong>gperl_new_object()</strong> with <em>own</em> set to
<code>%TRUE</code>; this will cause the first matching sink function to
be called on the GObject to claim ownership of that object, so that it
will be destroyed when the perl object goes out of scope. The default
sink func is <strong>g_object_unref()</strong>; other types should
supply the proper function; e.g., GtkObject should use
<strong>gtk_object_sink()</strong> here. Returns the blessed perl
object, or #&amp;PL_sv_undef if object was #NULL.</p>

<dt>GObject * gperl_get_object (SV * sv)</dt>

<dt>GObject * gperl_get_object_check (SV * sv, GType gtype);</dt>

<h2>GValue</h2>
<p>GValue is GLib's generic value container, and it is because of GValue
that the run time type handling of GObject parameters and GClosure
marshaling can function, and most usages of these functions will be from
those two points.</p>
<p>Client code will run into uses for
<strong>gperl_sv_from_value()</strong> and
<strong>gperl_value_from_sv()</strong> when trying to convert lists of
parameters into GValue arrays and the like.</p>
<dl>
<dt>gboolean gperl_value_from_sv (GValue * value, SV * sv)</dt>
<dd>
<p>set a <em>value</em> from a whatever is in <em>sv</em>.
<em>value</em> must be initialized so the code knows what kind of value
to coerce out of <em>sv</em>. Return value is always TRUE; if the code
knows how to perform the conversion, it croaks. (The return value is for
backward compatibility.) In reality, this really ought to always
succeed; a failed conversion should be considered a bug or unimplemented
code!</p>
</dd>
<dt>SV * gperl_sv_from_value (const GValue * value)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Coerce whatever is in <em>value</em> into a perl scalar and return
it. Croaks if the code doesn't know how to perform the conversion. Might
end up calling other Perl code. So if you use this function in XS code
for a generic GType, make sure the stack pointer is set up correctly
before the call, and restore it after the call.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GClosure / GPerlClosure</h2>
<p>GPerlClosure is a wrapper around the gobject library's GClosure with
special handling for marshalling perl subroutines as callbacks. This is
specially tuned for use with GSignal and stuff like io watch, timeout,
and idle handlers.</p>
<p>For generic callback functions, which need parameters but do not get
registered with the type system, this is sometimes overkill. See
GPerlCallback, below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>GClosure * gperl_closure_new (SV * callback, SV * data, gboolean
swap)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create and return a new GPerlClosure. <em>callback</em> and
<em>data</em> will be copied for storage; <em>callback</em> must not be
NULL. If <em>swap</em> is TRUE, <em>data</em> will be swapped with the
instance during invocation (this is used to implement
<strong>g_signal_connect_swapped()</strong>). If compiled under a
thread-enabled perl, the closure will be created and marshaled in such a
way as to ensure that the same interpreter which created the closure
will be used to invoke it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GClosure * gperl_closure_new_with_marshaller (SV * callback, SV *
data, gboolean swap, GClosureMarshal marshaller)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like <code>gperl_closure_new</code>, but uses a caller-supplied
marshaller. This is provided for use in those sticky circumstances when
you just can't do it any other way; in general, you want to use the
default marshaller, which you get if you provide NULL for
<em>marshaller</em>. If you use you own marshaller, you need to take
care of everything yourself, including swapping the instance and data if
<code>GPERL_CLOSURE_SWAP_DATA</code> (closure) is true, calling
<code>gperl_run_exception_handlers</code> if ERRSV is true after
invoking the perl sub, and ensuring that you properly use the
<code>marshal_data</code> parameter as the perl interpreter when
PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT is defined. See the implementation of the default
marshaller, <code>gperl_closure_marshal</code>, in Glib/GClosure.xs for
inspiration.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GPerlCallback</h2>
<p>generic callback functions usually get invoked directly, and are not
passed parameter lists as GValues. we could very easily wrap up such
generic callbacks with something that converts the parameters to GValues
and then channels everything through GClosure, but this has two
problems: 1) the above implementation of GClosure is tuned to
marshalling signal handlers, which always have an instance object, and
2) it's more work than is strictly necessary.</p>
<p>additionally, generic callbacks aren't always kind to the GClosure
paradigm.</p>
<p>so, here's GPerlCallback, which is designed specifically to run
generic callback functions. it reads parameters off the C stack and
converts them into parameters on the perl stack. (it uses the GValue
to/from SV mechanism to do so, but doesn't allocate any temps on the
heap.) the callback object itself stores the parameter type list.</p>
<p>unfortunately, since the data element is always last, but the number
of arguments is not known until we have the callback object, we can't
pass gperl_callback_invoke directly to functions requiring a callback;
you'll have to write a proxy callback which calls
gperl_callback_invoke.</p>
<dl>
<dt>GPerlCallback * gperl_callback_new (SV * func, SV * data, gint
n_params, GType param_types[], GType return_type)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create and return a new GPerlCallback; use gperl_callback_destroy
when you are finished with it. <em>func</em>: perl subroutine to call.
this SV will be copied, so don't worry about reference counts. must
<strong>not</strong> be #NULL. <em>data</em>: scalar to pass to
<em>func</em> in addition to all other arguments. the SV will be copied,
so don't worry about reference counts. may be #NULL. <em>n_params</em>:
the number of elements in <em>param_types</em>. <em>param_types</em>:
the #GType of each argument that should be passed from the invocation to
<em>func</em>. may be #NULL if <em>n_params</em> is zero, otherwise it
must be <em>n_params</em> elements long or nasty things will happen.
this array will be copied; see <strong>gperl_callback_invoke()</strong>
for how it is used. <em>return_type</em>: the #GType of the return
value, or 0 if the function has void return.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_callback_destroy (GPerlCallback * callback)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dispose of <em>callback</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_callback_invoke (GPerlCallback * callback, GValue *
return_value, ...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Marshall the variadic parameters according to <em>callback</em>'s
param_types, and then invoke <em>callback</em>'s subroutine in scalar
context, or void context if the return type is G_TYPE_VOID. If
<em>return_value</em> is not NULL, then value returned (if any) will be
copied into <em>return_value</em>. A typical callback handler would look
like this: static gint real_c_callback (Foo * f, Bar * b, int a,
gpointer data) { GPerlCallback * callback = (GPerlCallback*)data; GValue
return_value = {0,}; gint retval; g_value_init (&amp;return_value,
callback-&gt;return_type); gperl_callback_invoke (callback,
&amp;return_value, f, b, a); retval = g_value_get_int
(&amp;return_value); g_value_unset (&amp;return_value); return retval;
}</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
<p>Like Event, Tk, and most other callback-using, event-based perl
modules, Glib traps exceptions that happen in callbacks. To enable your
code to do something about these exceptions, Glib stores a list of
exception handlers which will be called on the trapped exceptions. This
is completely distinct from the <code>$SIG</code>{_â€†_DIE_â€†_} mechanism
provided by Perl itself, for various reasons (not the least of which is
that the Perl docs and source code say that <code>$SIG</code>{_â€†_DIE_â€†_}
is intended for running as the program is about to exit, and other
behaviors may be removed in the future (apparently a source of much
debate on p5p)).</p>
<dl>
<dt>int gperl_install_exception_handler (GClosure * closure)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Install a GClosure to be executed when
<strong>gperl_closure_invoke()</strong> traps an exception. The closure
should return boolean (TRUE if the handler should remain installed) and
expect to receive a perl scalar. This scalar will be a private copy of
ERRSV ($@) which the handler can mangle to its heart's content. The
return value is an integer id tag that may be passed to
<strong>gperl_removed_exception_handler()</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_remove_exception_handler (guint tag)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove the exception handler identified by <em>tag</em>, as returned
by <strong>gperl_install_exception_handler()</strong>. If <em>tag</em>
cannot be found, this does nothing. WARNING: this function locks a
global data structure, so do NOT call it recursively. also, calling this
from within an exception handler will result in a deadlock situation. if
you want to remove your handler just have it return FALSE.</p>
</dd>
<dt>void gperl_run_exception_handlers (void)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke whatever exception handlers are installed. You will need this
if you have written a custom marshaler. Uses the value of the global
ERRSV.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>GSignal</h2>
<dl>
<dt>void gperl_signal_set_marshaller_for (GType instance_type, char *
detailed_signal, GClosureMarshal marshaller)</dt>
<dd>
<p>You need this function only in rare cases, usually as workarounds for
bad signal parameter types or to implement writable arguments. Use the
given <em>marshaller</em> to marshal all handlers for
<em>detailed_signal</em> on <em>instance_type</em>.
<code>gperl_signal_connect</code> will look for marshallers registered
here, and apply them to the GPerlClosure it creates for the given
callback being connected. A canonical form of <em>detailed_signal</em>
will be used so that <em>marshaller</em> is applied for all possible
spellings of the signal name. Use the helper macros in gperl_marshal.h
to help write your marshaller function. That header, which is installed
with the Glib module but not #included through gperl.h, includes
commentary and examples which you should follow closely to avoid nasty
bugs. Use the Source, Luke. WARNING: Bend over backwards and turn your
head around 720 degrees before attempting to write a GPerlClosure
marshaller without using the macros in gperl_marshal.h. If you
absolutely cannot use those macros, be certain to understand what those
macros do so you can get the semantics correct, and keep your code
synchronized with them, or you may miss very important bugfixes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gulong gperl_signal_connect (SV * instance, char * detailed_signal,
SV * callback, SV * data, GConnectFlags flags)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The actual workhorse behind GObject::signal_connect, the binding for
g_signal_connect, for use from within XS. This creates a
<code>GPerlClosure</code> wrapper for the given <em>callback</em> and
<em>data</em>, and connects that closure to the signal named
<em>detailed_signal</em> on the given GObject <em>instance</em>. This is
only good for named signals. <em>flags</em> is the same as for
<strong>g_signal_connect()</strong>. <em>data</em> may be NULL, but
<em>callback</em> must not be. Returns the id of the installed
callback.</p>
