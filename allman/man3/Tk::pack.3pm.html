<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::pack - Geometry manager that packs around edges of cavity</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>    <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>pack</strong>?(<em>args</em>)?</p>
<p>    <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>pack</strong><em>Option</em>?(<em>args</em>)?</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>pack</strong> method is used to communicate with the
packer, a geometry manager that arranges the children of a parent by
packing them in order around the edges of the parent.</p>
<p>In this <strong>perl</strong> port of Tk it is normal to pack widgets
one-at-a-time using the widget object to be packed to invoke a method
call. This is a slight distortion of underlying Tk interface (which can
handle lists of windows to one pack method call) but has proven
effective in practice.</p>
<p>The <strong>pack</strong> method can have any of several forms,
depending on <em>Option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$slave-&gt;pack?(options)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The options consist of pairs of arguments that specify how to manage
the slave. See THE PACKER ALGORITHM below for details on how the options
are used by the packer. The following options are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-after =&gt; $other</dt>
<dd>
<p><em><code>$other</code></em> must be another window. Use its master
as the master for the slave, and insert the slave just after
<em><code>$other</code></em> in the packing order.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-anchor =&gt; anchor</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Anchor</em> must be a valid anchor position such as
<strong>n</strong> or <strong>sw</strong>; it specifies where to
position each slave in its parcel. Defaults to
<strong>center</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-before =&gt; $other</dt>
<dd>
<p><em><code>$other</code></em> must be another window. Use its master
as the master for the slave, and insert the slave just before
<em><code>$other</code></em> in the packing order.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-expand =&gt; boolean</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether the slave should be expanded to consume extra space
in their master. <em>Boolean</em> may have any proper boolean value,
such as <strong>1</strong> or <strong>no</strong>. Defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-fill =&gt; style</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a slave's parcel is larger than its requested dimensions, this
option may be used to stretch the slave. <em>Style</em> must have one of
the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>
<p>Give the slave its requested dimensions plus any internal padding
requested with <strong>-ipadx</strong> or <strong>-ipady</strong>. This
is the default.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol start="24" type="a">
<li><p>Stretch the slave horizontally to fill the entire width of its
parcel (except leave external padding as specified by
<strong>-padx</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch the slave vertically to fill the entire height of its
parcel (except leave external padding as specified by
<strong>-pady</strong>).</p></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>both</dt>
<dd>
<p>Stretch the slave both horizontally and vertically.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>-in =&gt; $master</dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the slave(s) at the end of the packing order for the master
window given by <em><code>$master</code></em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-ipadx =&gt; amount</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much horizontal internal padding to
leave on each side of the slave(s). <em>Amount</em> must be a valid
screen distance, such as <strong>2</strong> or <strong>.5c</strong>. It
defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-ipady =&gt; amount</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave
on each side of the slave(s). <em>Amount</em> defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-padx =&gt; amount</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much horizontal external padding to
leave on each side of the slave(s). <em>Amount</em> defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-pady =&gt; amount</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much vertical external padding to leave
on each side of the slave(s). <em>Amount</em> defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-side =&gt; side</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies which side of the master the slave(s) will be packed
against. Must be <strong>left</strong>, <strong>right</strong>,
<strong>top</strong>, or <strong>bottom</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>top</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If no <strong>-in</strong>, <strong>-after</strong> or
<strong>-before</strong> option is specified then slave will be inserted
at the end of the packing list for its parent unless it is already
managed by the packer (in which case it will be left where it is). If
one of these options is specified then slave will be inserted at the
specified point. If the slave are already managed by the geometry
manager then any unspecified options for them retain their previous
values rather than receiving default values.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$slave-&gt;packConfigure?(options)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as <strong>pack</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$slave-&gt;packForget</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes <em>slave</em> from the packing order for its master and
unmaps its window. The slave will no longer be managed by the
packer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$slave-&gt;packInfo</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of
the slave given by <em><code>$slave</code></em> in the same option-value
form that might be specified to <strong>packConfigure</strong>. The
first two elements of the list are
``<strong>-in</strong>=&gt;<em><code>$master</code></em>'' where
<em><code>$master</code></em> is the slave's master.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$master-&gt;packPropagate?(boolean)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>boolean</em> has a true boolean value such as
<strong>1</strong> or <strong>on</strong> then propagation is enabled
for <em><code>$master</code></em>, (see GEOMETRY PROPAGATION below). If
<em>boolean</em> has a false boolean value then propagation is disabled
for <em><code>$master</code></em>. In either of these cases an empty
string is returned. If <em>boolean</em> is omitted then the method
returns <strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong> to indicate whether
propagation is currently enabled for <em><code>$master</code></em>.
Propagation is enabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$master-&gt;packSlaves</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of all of the slaves in the packing order for
<em><code>$master</code></em>. The order of the slaves in the list is
the same as their order in the packing order. If
<em><code>$master</code></em> has no slaves then an empty list/string is
returned in array/scalar context, respectively</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>THE PACKER ALGORITHM</h1>
<p>For each master the packer maintains an ordered list of slaves called
the <em>packing list</em>. The <strong>-in</strong>,
<strong>-after</strong>, and <strong>-before</strong> configuration
options are used to specify the master for each slave and the slave's
position in the packing list. If none of these options is given for a
slave then the slave is added to the end of the packing list for its
parent.</p>
<p>The packer arranges the slaves for a master by scanning the packing
list in order. At the time it processes each slave, a rectangular area
within the master is still unallocated. This area is called the
<em>cavity</em>; for the first slave it is the entire area of the
master.</p>
<p>For each slave the packer carries out the following steps:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The packer allocates a rectangular <em>parcel</em> for the slave
along the side of the cavity given by the slave's <strong>-side</strong>
option. If the side is top or bottom then the width of the parcel is the
width of the cavity and its height is the requested height of the slave
plus the <strong>-ipady</strong> and <strong>-pady</strong> options. For
the left or right side the height of the parcel is the height of the
cavity and the width is the requested width of the slave plus the
<strong>-ipadx</strong> and <strong>-padx</strong> options. The parcel
may be enlarged further because of the <strong>-expand</strong> option
(see EXPANSION below)</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The packer chooses the dimensions of the slave. The width will
normally be the slave's requested width plus twice its
<strong>-ipadx</strong> option and the height will normally be the
slave's requested height plus twice its <strong>-ipady</strong> option.
However, if the <strong>-fill</strong> option is <strong>x</strong> or
<strong>both</strong> then the width of the slave is expanded to fill
the width of the parcel, minus twice the <strong>-padx</strong> option.
If the <strong>-fill</strong> option is <strong>y</strong> or
<strong>both</strong> then the height of the slave is expanded to fill
the width of the parcel, minus twice the <strong>-pady</strong>
option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The packer positions the slave over its parcel. If the slave is
smaller than the parcel then the <strong>-anchor</strong> option
determines where in the parcel the slave will be placed. If
<strong>-padx</strong> or <strong>-pady</strong> is non-zero, then the
given amount of external padding will always be left between the slave
and the edges of the parcel. Once a given slave has been packed, the
area of its parcel is subtracted from the cavity, leaving a smaller
rectangular cavity for the next slave. If a slave doesn't use all of its
parcel, the unused space in the parcel will not be used by subsequent
slaves. If the cavity should become too small to meet the needs of a
slave then the slave will be given whatever space is left in the cavity.
If the cavity shrinks to zero size, then all remaining slaves on the
packing list will be unmapped from the screen until the master window
becomes large enough to hold them again.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXPANSION</h1>
<p>If a master window is so large that there will be extra space left
over after all of its slaves have been packed, then the extra space is
distributed uniformly among all of the slaves for which the
<strong>-expand</strong> option is set. Extra horizontal space is
distributed among the expandable slaves whose <strong>-side</strong> is
<strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong>, and extra vertical
space is distributed among the expandable slaves whose
<strong>-side</strong> is <strong>top</strong> or
<strong>bottom</strong>.</p>
<h1>GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</h1>
<p>The packer normally computes how large a master must be to just
exactly meet the needs of its slaves, and it sets the requested width
and height of the master to these dimensions. This causes geometry
information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a top-level
window so that the entire sub-tree sizes itself to fit the needs of the
leaf windows. However, the <strong>packPropagate</strong> method may be
used to turn off propagation for one or more masters. If propagation is
disabled then the packer will not set the requested width and height of
the packer. This may be useful if, for example, you wish for a master
window to have a fixed size that you specify.</p>
<h1>RESTRICTIONS ON MASTER WINDOWS</h1>
<p>The master for each slave must either be the slave's parent (the
default) or a descendant of the slave's parent. This restriction is
necessary to guarantee that the slave can be placed over any part of its
master that is visible without danger of the slave being clipped by its
parent.</p>
<h1>PACKING ORDER</h1>
<p>If the master for a slave is not its parent then you must make sure
that the slave is higher in the stacking order than the master.
Otherwise the master will obscure the slave and it will appear as if the
slave hasn't been packed correctly. The easiest way to make sure the
slave is higher than the master is to create the master window first:
the most recently created window will be highest in the stacking order.
Or, you can use the <strong>raise</strong> and <strong>lower</strong>
methods to change the stacking order of either the master or the
slave.</p>
