<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Pane - A window panner</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk::Pane; $pane = $mw-&gt;Scrolled("Pane", Name =&gt; fred,
-scrollbars =&gt; soe, -sticky =&gt; we, -gridded =&gt; y );
$pane-&gt;Frame; $pane-&gt;pack;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk::Pane</strong> provides a scrollable frame widget. Once
created it can be treated as a frame, except it is scrollable.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-gridded =&gt; direction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies if the top and left edges of the pane should snap to a grid
column. This option is only useful if the widgets in the pane are
managed by the <em>grid</em> geometry manager. Possible values are
<strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong> and <strong>xy</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-sticky =&gt; style</dt>
<dd>
<p>If Pane is larger than its requested dimensions, this option may be
used to position (or stretch) the slave within its cavity.
<em>Style</em> is a string that contains zero or more of the characters
n, s, e or w. The string can optionally contains spaces or commas, but
they are ignored. Each letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or
west) that the slave will stick to. If both n and s (or e and w) are
specified, the slave will be stretched to fill the entire height (or
width) of its cavity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>$pane-&gt;see($widget ?,options?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view so that <em><code>$widget</code></em> is visable.
Additional parameters in <em>options-value</em> pairs can be passed,
each <em>option-value</em> pair must be one of the following</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor =&gt; anchor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how to make the widget visable. If not given then as much
of the widget as possible is made visable. Possible values are
<strong>n</strong>, <strong>s</strong>, <strong>w</strong>,
<strong>e</strong>, <strong>nw</strong>, <strong>ne</strong>,
<strong>sw</strong> and <strong>se</strong>. This will cause an edge on
the widget to be aligned with the corresponding edge on the pane. for
example <strong>nw</strong> will cause the top left of the widget to be
placed at the top left of the pane. <strong>s</strong> will cause the
bottom of the widget to be placed at the bottom of the pane, and as much
of the widget as possible made visable in the x direction.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;xview</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real
fractions between 0 and 1. The first element gives the position of the
left of the window, relative to the Pane as a whole (0.5 means it is
halfway through the Pane, for example). The second element gives the
position of the right of the window, relative to the Pane as a
whole.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;xview($widget)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>widget</em> is displayed
at the left of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;xview(moveto =&gt; fraction)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>fraction</em> of the total
width of the Pane is off-screen to the left. fraction must be a fraction
between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;xview(scroll =&gt; number, what)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right
by <em>number</em>*10 screen units on the display; if it is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by number screenfuls. If
number is negative then widgets farther to the left become visible; if
it is positive then widgets farther to the right become visible.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;yview</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real
fractions between 0 and 1. The first element gives the position of the
top of the window, relative to the Pane as a whole (0.5 means it is
halfway through the Pane, for example). The second element gives the
position of the bottom of the window, relative to the Pane as a
whole.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;yview($widget)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>widget</em> is displayed
at the top of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;yview(moveto =&gt; fraction)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>fraction</em> of the total
width of the Pane is off-screen to the top. fraction must be a fraction
between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pane-&gt;yview(scroll =&gt; number, what)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shifts the view in the window up or down according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts up or down by
<em>number</em>*10 screen units on the display; if it is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by number screenfuls. If
number is negative then widgets farther up become visible; if it is
positive then widgets farther down become visible.</p>
