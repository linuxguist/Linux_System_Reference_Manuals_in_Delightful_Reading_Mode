<p>Modifies the default state of the canvas where <em>state</em> may be
set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden. Individual canvas objects
all have their own state option, which overrides the default state. Many
options can take separate specifications such that the appearance of the

greater than zero, the horizontal view in the window will be constrained
so that the canvas x coordinate at the left edge of the window is always
an even multiple of <strong>xScrollIncrement</strong>; furthermore, the
units for scrolling (e.g., the change in view when the left and right
arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be
<strong>xScrollIncrement</strong>. If the value of this option is less
than or equal to zero, then horizontal scrolling is unconstrained.</p>

</dl>
<p>Specifies an increment for vertical scrolling, in any of the usual
forms permitted for screen distances. If the value of this option is
greater than zero, the vertical view in the window will be constrained
so that the canvas y coordinate at the top edge of the window is always
an even multiple of <strong>yScrollIncrement</strong>; furthermore, the
units for scrolling (e.g., the change in view when the top and bottom
arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Canvas</strong> method creates a new window (given by the
<code>$canvas</code> argument) and makes it into a canvas widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the canvas such
as its colors and 3-D relief. The <strong>canvas</strong> command
returns its <code>$canvas</code> argument. At the time this command is
invoked, there must not exist a window named <code>$canvas</code>, but
<code>$canvas</code>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>Canvas widgets implement structured graphics. A canvas displays any
number of <em>items</em>, which may be things like rectangles, circles,
lines, and text. Items may be manipulated (e.g. moved or re-colored) and
callbacks may be associated with items in much the same way that the
bind method allows callbacks to be bound to widgets. For example, a
particular callback may be associated with the
<strong>&lt;Button-1&gt;</strong> event so that the callback is invoked
whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse cursor over an item. This
means that items in a canvas can have behaviors defined by the Callbacks
bound to them.</p>
<h1>DISPLAY LIST</h1>
<p>The items in a canvas are ordered for purposes of display, with the
first item in the display list being displayed first, followed by the
next item in the list, and so on. Items later in the display list
obscure those that are earlier in the display list and are sometimes
referred to as being <em>``on top''</em> of earlier items. When a new
item is created it is placed at the end of the display list, on top of
everything else. Widget methods may be used to re-arrange the order of
the display list.</p>
<p>Window items are an exception to the above rules. The underlying
window systems require them always to be drawn on top of other items. In
addition, the stacking order of window items is not affected by any of
the canvas methods; you must use the raise and lower Tk widget methods
instead.</p>
<h1>ITEM IDS AND TAGS</h1>
<p>Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or
by tag. Each item has a unique identifying number which is assigned to
that item when it is created. The id of an item never changes and id
numbers are never re-used within the lifetime of a canvas widget.</p>
<p>Each item may also have any number of <em>tags</em> associated with
it. A tag is just a string of characters, and it may take any form
except that of an integer. For example, ``x123'' is OK but ``123''
isn't. The same tag may be associated with many different items. This is
commonly done to group items in various interesting ways; for example,
all selected items might be given the tag ``selected''.</p>
<p>The tag <strong>all</strong> is implicitly associated with every item
in the canvas; it may be used to invoke operations on all the items in
the canvas.</p>
<p>The tag <strong>current</strong> is managed automatically by Tk; it
applies to the <em>current item</em>, which is the topmost item whose
drawn area covers the position of the mouse cursor. If the mouse is not
in the canvas widget or is not over an item, then no item has the
<strong>current</strong> tag.</p>
<p>When specifying items in canvas methods, if the specifier is an
integer then it is assumed to refer to the single item with that id. If
the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to refer to all of
the items in the canvas that have a tag matching the specifier. The
symbol <em>tagOrId</em> is used below to indicate that an argument
specifies either an id that selects a single item or a tag that selects
zero or more items.</p>
<p><em>tagOrId</em> may contain a logical expressions of tags by using
operators: '&amp;&amp;', '||', '^' '!', and parenthezised
subexpressions. For example:</p>
<p><code>$c</code>-&gt;find('withtag',
'(a&amp;&amp;!b)|(!a&amp;&amp;b)');</p>
<p>or equivalently:</p>
<p><code>$c</code>-&gt;find('withtag', 'a^b');</p>
<p>will find only those items with either a or b tags, but not both.</p>
<p>Some methods only operate on a single item at a time; if
<em>tagOrId</em> is specified in a way that names multiple items, then
the normal behavior is for the methods is to use the first (lowest) of
these items in the display list that is suitable for the method.
Exceptions are noted in the method descriptions below.</p>
<h1>COORDINATES</h1>
<p>All coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point
numbers. Coordinates and distances are specified in screen units, which
are floating-point numbers optionally followed by one of several
letters. If no letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels. If the
letter is <strong>m</strong> then the distance is in millimeters on the
screen; if it is <strong>c</strong> then the distance is in centimeters;
<strong>i</strong> means inches, and <strong>p</strong> means printers
points (1/72 inch). Larger y-coordinates refer to points lower on the
screen; larger x-coordinates refer to points farther to the right.</p>
<h1>TRANSFORMATIONS</h1>
<p>Normally the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at the
upper-left corner of the window containing the canvas. It is possible to
adjust the origin of the canvas coordinate system relative to the origin
of the window using the <strong>xview</strong> and
<strong>yview</strong> methods; this is typically used for scrolling.
Canvases do not support scaling or rotation of the canvas coordinate
system relative to the window coordinate system.</p>
<p>Individual items may be moved or scaled using methods described
below, but they may not be rotated.</p>
<h1>INDICES</h1>
<p>Text items support the notion of an <em>index</em> for identifying
particular positions within the item.</p>
<p>Indices are used for methods such as inserting text, deleting a range
of characters, and setting the insertion cursor position. An index may
be specified in any of a number of ways, and different types of items
may support different forms for specifying indices.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, line and polygon items support <em>index</em>
for identifying, inserting and deleting subsets of their coordinates.
Indices are used for commands such as inserting or deleting a range of
characters or coordinates, and setting the insertion cursor position. An
index may be specified in any of a number of ways, and different types
of items may support different forms for specifying indices.</p>
<p>Text items support the following forms for an index; if you define
new types of text-like items, it would be advisable to support as many
of these forms as practical. Note that it is possible to refer to the
character just after the last one in the text item; this is necessary
for such tasks as inserting new text at the end of the item. Lines and
Polygons don't support the insertion cursor and the selection. Their
indices are supposed to be even always, because coordinates always
appear in pairs.</p>
<dl>
<dt>number</dt>
<dd>
<p>A decimal number giving the position of the desired character within
the text item. 0 refers to the first character, 1 to the next character,
and so on. If indexes are odd for lines and polygons, they will be
automatically decremented by one. A number less than 0 is treated as if
it were zero, and a number greater than the length of the text item is
treated as if it were equal to the length of the text item. For
polygons, numbers less than 0 or greater then the length of the
coordinate list will be adjusted by adding or substracting the length
until the result is between zero and the length, inclusive.</p>
</dd>
<dt>end</dt>
<dd>
<p>Refers to the character or coordinate just after the last one in the
item (same as the number of characters or coordinates in the item).</p>
</dd>
<dt>insert</dt>
<dd>
<p>Refers to the character just before which the insertion cursor is
drawn in this item. Not valid for lines and polygons.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sel.first</dt>
<dd>
<p>Refers to the first selected character in the item. If the selection
isn't in this item then this form is illegal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sel.last</dt>
<dd>
<p>Refers to the last selected character in the item. If the selection
isn't in this item then this form is illegal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[x,y]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Refers to the character or coordinate at the point given by
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are specified
in the coordinate system of the canvas. If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> lie
outside the coordinates covered by the text item, then they refer to the
first or last character in the line that is closest to the given point.
The Tcl string form @x,y is also allowed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DASH PATTERNS</h1>
<p>Many items support the notion of an dash pattern for outlines.</p>
<p>The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element
represents the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd segments
are drawn using the outline color. The other segments are drawn
transparent.</p>
<p>The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5
possible characters <strong>[.,-_ ]</strong>, with the first 4
characters producing a segment of length 1 to 4, respectively, followed
by a transparent segment of length 2. The space can be used repeatedly
to enlarge the space between other line elements by 1, and can not occur
as the first position in the string. The main difference of this syntax
with the previous one is that it it shape-conserving. This means that
all values in the dash list will be multiplied by the line width before
display. This assures that . will always be displayed as a dot and -
always as a dash regardless of the line width.</p>
<p>Some examples, for a line width of 2:</p>
<p>-dash . = -dash [2,4] -dash - = -dash [6,4] -dash -. = -dash
[6,4,2,4] -dash -.. = -dash [6,4,2,4,2,4] -dash . = -dash [2,8] -dash ,
= -dash [4,4]</p>
<p>On systems where only a limited set of dash patterns is available,
the dash pattern will be displayed as the closest available dash
pattern. For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the above examples
are available. The last 2 examples will be displayed identically as the
first one.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Canvas</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for canvas
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;addtag(tag, searchSpec, ?arg, arg, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>For each item that meets the constraints specified by
<em>searchSpec</em> and the <em>arg</em>s, add <em>tag</em> to the list
of tags associated with the item if it isn't already present on that
list. It is possible that no items will satisfy the constraints given by
<em>searchSpec</em> and <em>arg</em>s, in which case the method has no
effect. This command returns an empty string as result.
<em>SearchSpec</em> and <em>arg</em>'s may take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>above tagOrId</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects the item just after (above) the one given by <em>tagOrId</em>
in the display list. If <em>tagOrId</em> denotes more than one item,
then the last (topmost) of these items in the display list is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>all</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects all the items in the canvas.</p>
</dd>
<dt>below tagOrId</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects the item just before (below) the one given by
<em>tagOrId</em> in the display list. If <em>tagOrId</em> denotes more
than one item, then the first (lowest) of these items in the display
list is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>closest x y ?halo? ?start?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects the item closest to the point given by <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em>. If more than one item is at the same closest distance (e.g.
two items overlap the point), then the top-most of these items (the last
one in the display list) is used. If <em>halo</em> is specified, then it
must be a non-negative value. Any item closer than <em>halo</em> to the
point is considered to overlap it. The <em>start</em> argument may be
used to step circularly through all the closest items. If <em>start</em>
is specified, it names an item using a tag or id (if by tag, it selects
the first item in the display list with the given tag). Instead of
selecting the topmost closest item, this form will select the topmost
closest item that is below <em>start</em> in the display list; if no
such item exists, then the selection behaves as if the <em>start</em>
argument had not been specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>enclosed x1 y1 x2 y2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects all the items completely enclosed within the rectangular
region given by <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em>.
<em>X1</em> must be no greater then <em>x2</em> and <em>y1</em> must be
no greater than <em>y2</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>overlapping x1 y1 x2 y2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects all the items that overlap or are enclosed within the
rectangular region given by <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and
<em>y2</em>. <em>X1</em> must be no greater then <em>x2</em> and
<em>y1</em> must be no greater than <em>y2</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>withtag tagOrId</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects all the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;bbox(tagOrId, ?tagOrId, tagOrId, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list with four elements giving an approximate bounding box
for all the items named by the <em>tagOrId</em> arguments. The list has
the form ``<em>x1 y1 x2 y2</em>'' such that the drawn areas of all the
named elements are within the region bounded by <em>x1</em> on the left,
<em>x2</em> on the right, <em>y1</em> on the top, and <em>y2</em> on the
bottom. The return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by a
few pixels. If no items match any of the <em>tagOrId</em> arguments or
if the matching items have empty bounding boxes (i.e. they have nothing
to display) then an empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;bind(tagOrId?, sequence? ?,callback?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method associates <em>callback</em> with all the items given by
<em>tagOrId</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by
<em>sequence</em> occurs for one of the items the callback will be
invoked. This method is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> method
except that it operates on items in a canvas rather than entire widgets.
See Tk::bind for complete details on the syntax of <em>sequence</em> and
the substitutions performed on <em>callback</em> before invoking it. If
all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any
existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagOrId</em> (if
the first character of <em>command</em> is ``+'' then <em>command</em>
augments an existing binding rather than replacing it). In this case the
return value is an empty string. If <em>callback</em> is omitted then
the method returns the <em>callback</em> associated with
<em>tagOrId</em> and <em>sequence</em> (an error occurs if there is no
such binding). If both <em>callback</em> and <em>sequence</em> are
omitted then the method returns a list of all the sequences for which
bindings have been defined for <em>tagOrId</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only events for which bindings may be specified are those related
to the mouse and keyboard (such as <strong>Enter</strong>,
<strong>Leave</strong>, <strong>ButtonPress</strong>,
<strong>Motion</strong>, and <strong>KeyPress</strong>) or virtual
events. The handling of events in canvases uses the current item defined
in ITEM IDS AND TAGS above. <strong>Enter</strong> and
<strong>Leave</strong> events trigger for an item when it becomes the
current item or ceases to be the current item; note that these events
are different than <strong>Enter</strong> and <strong>Leave</strong>
events for windows. Mouse-related events are directed to the current
item, if any. Keyboard-related events are directed to the focus item, if
any (see the focus method below for more on this). If a virtual event is
used in a binding, that binding can trigger only if the virtual event is
defined by an underlying mouse-related or keyboard-related event. It is
possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event. This could
occur, for example, if one binding is associated with the item's id and
another is associated with one of the item's tags. When this occurs, all
of the matching bindings are invoked. A binding associated with the
<strong>all</strong> tag is invoked first, followed by one binding for
each of the item's tags (in order), followed by a binding associated
with the item's id. If there are multiple matching bindings for a single
tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked. A
<strong>continue</strong> in a callback terminates that subroutine, and
a <strong>break</strong> method terminates that subroutine and skips any
remaining callbacks for the event, just as for the <strong>bind</strong>
method. If bindings have been created for a canvas window using the
<strong>CanvasBind</strong> method, then they are invoked in addition to
bindings created for the canvas's items using the <strong>bind</strong>
method. The bindings for items will be invoked before any of the
bindings for the window as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;canvasx(screenx?, gridspacing?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given a window x-coordinate in the canvas <em>screenx</em>, this
method returns the canvas x-coordinate that is displayed at that
location. If <em>gridspacing</em> is specified, then the canvas
coordinate is rounded to the nearest multiple of <em>gridspacing</em>
units.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;canvasy(screeny, ?gridspacing?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given a window y-coordinate in the canvas <em>screeny</em> this
method returns the canvas y-coordinate that is displayed at that
location. If <em>gridspacing</em> is specified, then the canvas
coordinate is rounded to the nearest multiple of <em>gridspacing</em>
units.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;coords(tagOrId ?x0,y0 ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the coordinates that define an item. If no
coordinates are specified, this method returns a list whose elements are
the coordinates of the item named by <em>tagOrId</em>. If coordinates
are specified, then they replace the current coordinates for the named
item. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to multiple items, then the first one
in the display list is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;create(type, x, y, ?x, y, ...?, ?option, value,
...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a new item in <em><code>$canvas</code></em> of type
<em>type</em>. The exact format of the arguments after
<strong>type</strong> depends on <strong>type</strong>, but usually they
consist of the coordinates for one or more points, followed by
specifications for zero or more item options. See the subsections on
individual item types below for more on the syntax of this method. This
method returns the id for the new item.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;dchars(tagOrId, first, ?last?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>For each item given by <em>tagOrId</em>, delete the characters, or
coordinates, in the range given by <em>first</em> and <em>last</em>,
inclusive. If some of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> don't support
Text items interpret <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> as indices to a
character, line and polygon items interpret them indices to a coordinate
(an x,y pair). within the item(s) as described in INDICES above. If
<em>last</em> is omitted, it defaults to <em>first</em>. This method
returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;delete(?tagOrId, tagOrId, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delete each of the items given by each <em>tagOrId</em>, and return
an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;dtag(tagOrId, ?tagToDelete?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>For each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>, delete the tag given
by <em>tagToDelete</em> from the list of those associated with the item.
If an item doesn't have the tag <em>tagToDelete</em> then the item is
unaffected by the method. If <em>tagToDelete</em> is omitted then it
defaults to <em>tagOrId</em>. This method returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;find(searchCommand, ?arg, arg, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns a list consisting of all the items that meet the
constraints specified by <em>searchCommand</em> and <em>arg</em>'s.
<em>SearchCommand</em> and <em>args</em> have any of the forms accepted
by the <strong>addtag</strong> method. The items are returned in
stacking order, with the lowest item first.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focus</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;focus(?tagOrId?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Set the keyboard focus for the canvas widget to the item given by
<em>tagOrId</em>. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to several items, then the
focus is set to the first such item in the display list that supports
the insertion cursor. If <em>tagOrId</em> doesn't refer to any items, or
if none of them support the insertion cursor, then the focus isn't
changed. If <em>tagOrId</em> is an empty string, then the focus item is
reset so that no item has the focus. If <em>tagOrId</em> is not
specified then the method returns the id for the item that currently has
the focus, or an empty string if no item has the focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the focus has been set to an item, the item will display the
insertion cursor and all keyboard events will be directed to that item.
The focus item within a canvas and the focus window on the screen (set
with the <strong>focus</strong> method) are totally independent: a given
item doesn't actually have the input focus unless (a) its canvas is the
focus window and (b) the item is the focus item within the canvas. In
most cases it is advisable to follow the <strong>focus</strong> widget
method with the <strong>CanvasFocus</strong> method to set the focus
window to the canvas (if it wasn't there already).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;gettags(tagOrId)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return a list whose elements are the tags associated with the item
given by <em>tagOrId</em>. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to more than one
item, then the tags are returned from the first such item in the display
list. If <em>tagOrId</em> doesn't refer to any items, or if the item
contains no tags, then an empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;icursor(tagOrId, index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the position of the insertion cursor for the item(s) given by
<em>tagOrId</em> to just before the character whose position is given by
<em>index</em>. If some or all of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>
don't support an insertion cursor then this method has no effect on
them. See INDICES above for a description of the legal forms for
<em>index</em>. Note: the insertion cursor is only displayed in an item
if that item currently has the keyboard focus (see the widget method
<strong>focus</strong>, below), but the cursor position may be set even
when the item doesn't have the focus. This method returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;index(tagOrId, index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns a decimal string giving the numerical index
within <em>tagOrId</em> corresponding to <em>index</em>. <em>Index</em>
gives a textual description of the desired position as described in
INDICES above. Text items interpret <em>index</em> as an index to a
character, line and polygon items interpret it as an index to a
coordinate (an x,y pair). The return value is guaranteed to lie between
0 and the number of characters, or coordinates, within the item,
inclusive. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to multiple items, then the index
is processed in the first of these items that supports indexing
operations (in display list order).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;insert(tagOrId, beforeThis, string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>For each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>, if the item supports
text or coordinate, insertion then <em>string</em> is inserted into the
item's text just before the character, or coordinate, whose index is
<em>beforeThis</em>. Text items interpret <em>beforethis</em> as an
index to a character, line and polygon items interpret it as an index to
a coordinate (an x,y pair). For lines and polygons the <em>string</em>
must be a valid coordinate sequence. See INDICES above for information
about the forms allowed for <em>beforeThis</em>. This method returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;itemcget(tagOrId, option)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option for the item
given by <em>tagOrId</em> whose name is <em>option</em>. This method is
similar to the cget method except that it applies to a particular item
rather than the widget as a whole. <em>Option</em> may have any of the
values accepted by the <strong>create</strong> method when the item was
created. If <em>tagOrId</em> is a tag that refers to more than one item,
the first (lowest) such item is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;itemconfigure(tagOrId, ?option?, ?value?, ?option,
value, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is similar to the configure method except that it
modifies item-specific options for the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>
instead of modifying options for the overall canvas widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for the first item given by <em>tagOrId</em> (see
Tk::options for information on the format of this list). If
<em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the method
returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be
identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the method modifies the given widget option(s)
to have the given value(s) in each of the items given by
<em>tagOrId</em>; in this case the method returns an empty string. The
<em>option</em>s and <em>value</em>s are the same as those permissible
in the <strong>create</strong> method when the item(s) were created; see
the sections describing individual item types below for details on the
legal options.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;lower(tagOrId, ?belowThis?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Move all of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> to a new position in
the display list just before the item given by <em>belowThis</em>. If
<em>tagOrId</em> refers to more than one item then all are moved but the
relative order of the moved items will not be changed.
<em>BelowThis</em> is a tag or id; if it refers to more than one item
then the first (lowest) of these items in the display list is used as
the destination location for the moved items. Note: this method has no
effect on window items. Window items always obscure other item types,
and the stacking order of window items is determined by the
<strong>raise</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> methods of the widget,
not the <strong>raise</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> methods for
canvases. This method returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;move(tagOrId, xAmount, yAmount)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Move each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> in the canvas
coordinate space by adding <em>xAmount</em> to the x-coordinate of each
point associated with the item and <em>yAmount</em> to the y-coordinate
of each point associated with the item. This method returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;postscript(?option, value, option, value, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate a Postscript representation for part or all of the canvas.
If the <strong>-file</strong> option is specified then the Postscript is
written to a file and an empty string is returned; otherwise the
Postscript is returned as the result of the method. If the interpreter
that owns the canvas is marked as safe, the operation will fail because
safe interpreters are not allowed to write files. If the
<strong>-channel</strong> option is specified, the argument denotes the
name of a channel already opened for writing. The Postscript is written
to that channel, and the channel is left open for further writing at the
end of the operation. The Postscript is created in Encapsulated
Postscript form using version 3.0 of the Document Structuring
Conventions. Note: by default Postscript is only generated for
information that appears in the canvas's window on the screen. If the
canvas is freshly created it may still have its initial size of 1x1
pixel so nothing will appear in the Postscript. To get around this
problem either invoke the <strong>update</strong> method to wait for the
canvas window to reach its final size, or else use the
<strong>-width</strong> and <strong>-height</strong> options to specify
the area of the canvas to print. The <em>option</em>-<em>value</em>
argument pairs provide additional information to control the generation
of Postscript. The following options are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-colormap =&gt; hashRef</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>HashRef</em> must be a reference to a hash variable or an
anonymous hash that specifies a color mapping to use in the Postscript.
Each value of the hash must consist of Postscript code to set a
particular color value (e.g. ``<strong>1.0 1.0 0.0
setrgbcolor</strong>''). When outputting color information in the
Postscript, Tk checks to see if there is a key in the hash with the same
name as the color. If so, Tk uses the value of the element as the
Postscript method to set the color. If this option hasn't been
specified, or if there isn't a key in <em>hashRef</em> for a given
color, then Tk uses the red, green, and blue intensities from the X
color.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-colormode =&gt; mode</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how to output color information. <em>Mode</em> must be
either <strong>color</strong> (for full color output),
<strong>gray</strong> (convert all colors to their gray-scale
equivalents) or <strong>mono</strong> (convert all colors to black or
white).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-file =&gt; fileName</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the file in which to write the Postscript. If
this option isn't specified then the Postscript is returned as the
result of the method instead of being written to a file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-fontmap =&gt; hashRef</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>HashRef</em> must be a reference to a hash variable or an
anonymous hash that specifies a font mapping to use in the Postscript.
Each value of the hash must consist of an array reference with two
elements, which are the name and point size of a Postscript font. When
outputting Postscript commands for a particular font, Tk checks to see
if <em>hashRef</em> contains a value with the same name as the font. If
there is such an element, then the font information contained in that
element is used in the Postscript. Otherwise Tk attempts to guess what
Postscript font to use. Tk's guesses generally only work for well-known
fonts such as Times and Helvetica and Courier, and only if the X font
name does not omit any dashes up through the point size. For example,
<strong>-*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--*-120-*</strong> will work but
<strong>*Courier-Bold-R-Normal*120*</strong> will not; Tk needs the
dashes to parse the font name).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-height =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the height of the area of the canvas to print. Defaults to
the height of the canvas window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-pageanchor =&gt; anchor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies which point of the printed area of the canvas should appear
over the positioning point on the page (which is given by the
<strong>-pagex</strong> and <strong>-pagey</strong> options). For
example, <strong>-pageanchor</strong>=&gt;<strong>n</strong> means that
the top center of the area of the canvas being printed (as it appears in
the canvas window) should be over the positioning point. Defaults to
<strong>center</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-pageheight =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so
that the printed area is <em>size</em> high on the Postscript page.
<em>Size</em> consists of a floating-point number followed by
<strong>c</strong> for centimeters, <strong>i</strong> for inches,
<strong>m</strong> for millimeters, or <strong>p</strong> or nothing for
printer's points (1/72 inch). Defaults to the height of the printed area
on the screen. If both <strong>-pageheight</strong> and
<strong>-pagewidth</strong> are specified then the scale factor from
<strong>-pagewidth</strong> is used (non-uniform scaling is not
implemented).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-pagewidth =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so
that the printed area is <em>size</em> wide on the Postscript page.
<em>Size</em> has the same form as for <strong>-pageheight</strong>.
Defaults to the width of the printed area on the screen. If both
<strong>-pageheight</strong> and <strong>-pagewidth</strong> are
specified then the scale factor from <strong>-pagewidth</strong> is used
(non-uniform scaling is not implemented).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-pagex =&gt; position</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Position</em> gives the x-coordinate of the positioning point on
the Postscript page, using any of the forms allowed for
<strong>-pageheight</strong>. Used in conjunction with the
<strong>-pagey</strong> and <strong>-pageanchor</strong> options to
determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript page.
Defaults to the center of the page.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-pagey =&gt; position</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Position</em> gives the y-coordinate of the positioning point on
the Postscript page, using any of the forms allowed for
<strong>-pageheight</strong>. Used in conjunction with the
<strong>-pagex</strong> and <strong>-pageanchor</strong> options to
determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript page.
Defaults to the center of the page.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-rotate =&gt; boolean</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Boolean</em> specifies whether the printed area is to be rotated
90 degrees. In non-rotated output the x-axis of the printed area runs
along the short dimension of the page (``portrait'' orientation); in
rotated output the x-axis runs along the long dimension of the page
(``landscape'' orientation). Defaults to non-rotated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-width =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the width of the area of the canvas to print. Defaults to
the width of the canvas window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-x =&gt; position</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the x-coordinate of the left edge of the area of the canvas
that is to be printed, in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.
Defaults to the coordinate of the left edge of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-y =&gt; position</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the y-coordinate of the top edge of the area of the canvas
that is to be printed, in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.
Defaults to the coordinate of the top edge of the window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;raise(tagOrId, ?aboveThis?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Move all of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> to a new position in
the display list just after the item given by <em>aboveThis</em>. If
<em>tagOrId</em> refers to more than one item then all are moved but the
relative order of the moved items will not be changed.
<em>AboveThis</em> is a tag or id; if it refers to more than one item
then the last (topmost) of these items in the display list is used as
the destination location for the moved items. Note: this method has no
effect on window items. Window items always obscure other item types,
and the stacking order of window items is determined by the
<strong>raise</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> widget commands, not
the <strong>raise</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> methods for
canvases. This method returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;scale(tagOrId, xOrigin, yOrigin, xScale, yScale)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Rescale all of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> in canvas
coordinate space. <em>XOrigin</em> and <em>yOrigin</em> identify the
origin for the scaling operation and <em>xScale</em> and <em>yScale</em>
identify the scale factors for x- and y-coordinates, respectively (a
scale factor of 1.0 implies no change to that coordinate). For each of
the points defining each item, the x-coordinate is adjusted to change
the distance from <em>xOrigin</em> by a factor of <em>xScale</em>.
Similarly, each y-coordinate is adjusted to change the distance from
<em>yOrigin</em> by a factor of <em>yScale</em>. This method returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;scan(option, args)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is used to implement scanning on canvases. It has two
forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;scanMark(x, y)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Records <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> and the canvas's current view; used
in conjunction with later <strong>scanDragto</strong> method. Typically
this method is associated with a mouse button press in the widget and
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are the coordinates of the mouse. It returns
an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;scanDragto(x, y, ?gain?.)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method computes the difference between its <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> arguments (which are typically mouse coordinates) and the
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> arguments to the last
<strong>scanMark</strong> method for the widget. It then adjusts the
view by 10 times the difference in coordinates. This method is typically
associated It then adjusts the view by <em>gain</em> times the
difference in coordinates, where <em>gain</em> defaults to 10. This
command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget,
to produce the effect of dragging the canvas at high speed through its
window. The return value is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;select(option, ?tagOrId, arg?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Manipulates the selection in one of several ways, depending on
<em>option</em>. The method may take any of the forms described below.
In all of the descriptions below, <em>tagOrId</em> must refer to an item
that supports indexing and selection; if it refers to multiple items
then the first of these that supports indexing and the selection is
used. <em>Index</em> gives a textual description of a position within
<em>tagOrId</em>, as described in INDICES above.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;selectAdjust(tagOrId, index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Locate the end of the selection in <em>tagOrId</em> nearest to the
character given by <em>index</em>, and adjust that end of the selection
to be at <em>index</em> (i.e. including but not going beyond
<em>index</em>). The other end of the selection is made the anchor point
for future <strong>selectTo</strong> method calls. If the selection
isn't currently in <em>tagOrId</em> then this method behaves the same as
the <strong>selectTo</strong> widget method. Returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;selectClear</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clear the selection if it is in this widget. If the selection isn't
in this widget then the method has no effect. Returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;selectFrom(tagOrId, index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the selection anchor point for the widget to be just before the
character given by <em>index</em> in the item given by <em>tagOrId</em>.
This method doesn't change the selection; it just sets the fixed end of
the selection for future <strong>selectTo</strong> method calls. Returns
an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;selectItem</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the id of the selected item, if the selection is in an item
in this canvas. If the selection is not in this canvas then an empty
string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;selectTo(tagOrId, index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the selection to consist of those characters of <em>tagOrId</em>
between the selection anchor point and <em>index</em>. The new selection
will include the character given by <em>index</em>; it will include the
character given by the anchor point only if <em>index</em> is greater
than or equal to the anchor point. The anchor point is determined by the
most recent <strong>selectAdjust</strong> or <strong>selectFrom</strong>
method calls for this widget. If the selection anchor point for the
widget isn't currently in <em>tagOrId</em>, then it is set to the same
character given by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;type(tagOrId)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the type of the item given by <em>tagOrId</em>, such as
<strong>rectangle</strong> or <strong>text</strong>. If <em>tagOrId</em>
refers to more than one item, then the type of the first item in the
display list is returned. If <em>tagOrId</em> doesn't refer to any items
at all then an empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;xview(?args?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is used to query and change the horizontal position of
the information displayed in the canvas's window. It can take any of the
following forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;xview</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal span
that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2
and the second element is .6, 20% of the canvas's area (as defined by
the <strong>-scrollregion</strong> option) is off-screen to the left,
the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the canvas is
off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to scrollbars
via the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;xviewMoveto(fraction)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>fraction</em> of the total
width of the canvas is off-screen to the left. <em>Fraction</em> must be
a fraction between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;xviewScroll(number, what)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method shifts the view in the window left or right according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right
in units of the <strong>xScrollIncrement</strong> option, if it is
greater than zero, or in units of one-tenth the window's width
otherwise. If <em>what is</em> <strong>pages</strong> then the view
adjusts in units of nine-tenths the window's width. If <em>number</em>
is negative then information farther to the left becomes visible; if it
is positive then information farther to the right becomes visible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;yview(?args?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is used to query and change the vertical position of the
information displayed in the canvas's window. It can take any of the
following forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;yview</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the vertical span that
is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .6 and
the second element is 1.0, the lowest 40% of the canvas's area (as
defined by the <strong>-scrollregion</strong> option) is visible in the
window. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
<strong>-yscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;yviewMoveto(fraction)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>fraction</em> of the
canvas's area is off-screen to the top. <em>Fraction</em> is a fraction
between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;yviewScroll(number, what)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method adjusts the view in the window up or down according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong>. If <em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the
view adjusts up or down in units of the
<strong>yScrollIncrement</strong> option, if it is greater than zero, or
in units of one-tenth the window's height otherwise. If <em>what</em> is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts in units of nine-tenths the
window's height. If <em>number</em> is negative then higher information
becomes visible; if it is positive then lower information becomes
visible.</p>
</dd>

<h1>OVERVIEW OF ITEM TYPES</h1>
<p>The sections below describe the various types of items supported by
canvas widgets. Each item type is characterized by two things: first,
the form of the <strong>create</strong> method used to create instances
of the type; and second, a set of configuration options for items of
that type, which may be used in the <strong>create</strong> and
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods. Most items don't support
indexing or selection or the methods related to them, such as
<strong>index</strong> and <strong>insert</strong>. Where items do
support these facilities, it is noted explicitly in the descriptions
below. At present, text, line and polygon items provide this support.
For lines and polygons the indexing facility is used to manipulate the
coordinates of the item.</p>
<h1>ARC ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>arc</strong> appear on the display as
arc-shaped regions. An arc is a section of an oval delimited by two
angles (specified by the <strong>-start</strong> and
<strong>-extent</strong> options) and displayed in one of several ways
(specified by the <strong>-style</strong> option). Arcs are created with
methods of the following form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createArc(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value,
...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em>
give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular
region enclosing the oval that defines the arc. After the coordinates
there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of
which sets one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration. The following options are supported for arcs:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-dash =&gt; pattern</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-activedash =&gt; pattern</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-disableddash =&gt; pattern</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, the active
state, and the disabled state of an arc item. <em>pattern</em> may have
any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetDash</strong>. If the dash
options are omitted then the default is a solid outline.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-dashoffset =&gt; offset</dt>
<dd>
<p>The starting <em>offset</em> into the pattern provided by the
<strong>-dash</strong> option. <strong>-dashoffset</strong> is ignored
if there is no <strong>-dash</strong> pattern.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-extent =&gt; degrees</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the size of the angular range occupied by the arc. The
arc's range extends for <em>degrees</em> degrees counter-clockwise from
the starting angle given by the <strong>-start</strong> option.
<em>Degrees</em> may be negative. If it is greater than 360 or less than
-360, then <em>degrees</em> modulo 360 is used as the extent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-fill =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-activefill =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-disabledfill =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies the color to be used to fill the arc region in its normal,
active, and disabled states, <em>Color</em> may have any of the forms
accepted by <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>. If <em>color</em> is an empty
string (the default), then then the arc will not be filled.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-outline =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-activeoutline =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-disabledoutline =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option specifies the color that should be used to draw the
outline of the arc in its normal, active and disabled states.
<em>Color</em> may have any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>. This option defaults to
<strong>black</strong>. If <em>color</em> is specified as undef then no
outline is drawn for the arc.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-outlinestipple =&gt; bitmap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-activeoutlinestipple =&gt; bitmap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-disabledoutlinestipple =&gt; bitmap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw
the outline of the arc in its normal, active and disabled states.
Indicates that the outline for the arc should be drawn with a stipple
pattern; <em>bitmap</em> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of
the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. If the
<strong>-outline</strong> option hasn't been specified then this option
has no effect. If <em>bitmap</em> is an empty string (the default), then
the outline is drawn in a solid fashion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-start =&gt; degrees</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the beginning of the angular range occupied by the arc.
<em>Degrees</em> is given in units of degrees measured counter-clockwise
from the 3-o'clock position; it may be either positive or negative.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-state =&gt; state</dt>
<dd>
<p>Modifies the state of the arc item where <em>state</em> may be set to
one of: normal, disabled, hidden or ". If set to empty, the state of the
canvas itself is used. An arc item may also be in the active" state if
the mouse is currently over it. Many options can take separate
specifications in normal, active and disabled states such that the
appearance of the item can be different in each state.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-stipple =&gt; bitmap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-activestipple =&gt; bitmap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-disabledstipple =&gt; bitmap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill
the the arc in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>bitmap</em>
specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. If the <strong>-fill</strong> option
hasn't been specified then this option has no effect. If <em>bitmap</em>
is an empty string (the default), then filling is done in a solid
fashion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-style =&gt; type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how to draw the arc. If <em>type</em> is
<strong>pieslice</strong> (the default) then the arc's region is defined
by a section of the oval's perimeter plus two line segments, one between
the center of the oval and each end of the perimeter section. If
<em>type</em> is <strong>chord</strong> then the arc's region is defined
by a section of the oval's perimeter plus a single line segment
connecting the two end points of the perimeter section. If <em>type</em>
is <strong>arc</strong> then the arc's region consists of a section of
the perimeter alone. In this last case the <strong>-fill</strong> option
is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-tags =&gt; tagList</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item. <em>TagList</em>
consists of a list of tag names, which replace any existing tags for the
item. <em>TagList</em> may be an empty list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-updatecommand =&gt; command</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the arc item
is updated on the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-width =&gt; outlineWidth</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-activewidth =&gt; outlineWidth</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-disabledwidth =&gt; outlineWidth</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around the arc's
region, in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>outlineWidth</em>
may be in any of the forms described in the COORDINATES section above.
If the <strong>-outline</strong> option has been specified as undef then
this option has no effect. Wide outlines will be drawn centered on the
edges of the arc's region. This option defaults to 1.0.</p>
<h1>BITMAP ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>bitmap</strong> appear on the display as images
with two colors, foreground and background. Bitmaps are created with
methods of the following form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createBitmap(x, y, ?option, value, option, value,
...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> specify the coordinates of a
point used to position the bitmap on the display (see the
<strong>-anchor</strong> option below for more information on how
bitmaps are displayed). After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the
configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration. The following options are supported for bitmaps:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor =&gt; anchorPos</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>AnchorPos</em> tells how to position the bitmap relative to the
positioning point for the item; it may have any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetAnchor</strong>. For example, if <em>anchorPos</em> is
<strong>center</strong> then the bitmap is centered on the point; if
<em>anchorPos</em> is <strong>n</strong> then the bitmap will be drawn
so that its top center point is at the positioning point. This option
defaults to <strong>center</strong>.</p>

<h1>GRID ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>grid</strong> are intended for producing a
visual reference for interpreting other items. They can be drawn as
either lines (with dash style) or as rectangular dots at each grid
point.</p>
<p>Items of type <strong>grid</strong> are unlike other items they
always cover the whole of the canvas, but are never enclosed by nor
overlap any area and are not near any point. That is they are intended
to be always visible but not pickable, as such they do support the
active state. They are like other items in that: multiple grids are
permitted, they can be raised and lowered relative to other items, they
can be moved and scaled. As yet grids do not appear in PostScript
output.</p>
<p>Grids have outline like configure options. Grids are created with
methods of the following form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createGrid(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value,
...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em> give the origin of the grid.
<em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em> give the coordinates of the next grid point
in their respective directions. After the coordinates there may be any
number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one
of the configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration.</p>
<p>The following options are supported for grids:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-lines =&gt; boolean</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>-lines</strong> is set to a true value then lines are
drawn for both X and Y grids in the style determined by

<h1>IMAGE ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>image</strong> are used to display images on a
canvas. Images are created with methods of the following form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createImage(x, y, ?option, value, option, value,
...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> specify the coordinates of a
point used to position the image on the display (see the
<strong>-anchor</strong> option below for more information). After the
coordinates there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em>
pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options for the item.
These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration. The following options are supported for images:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor =&gt; anchorPos</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>AnchorPos</em> tells how to position the image relative to the
positioning point for the item; it may have any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetAnchor</strong>. For example, if <em>anchorPos</em> is
<strong>center</strong> then the image is centered on the point; if
<em>anchorPos</em> is <strong>n</strong> then the image will be drawn so
that its top center point is at the positioning point. This option
defaults to <strong>center</strong>.</p>

<h1>LINE ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>line</strong> appear on the display as one or
more connected line segments or curves. Line items support coordinate
indexing operations using the canvas methods: <strong>dchars, index,
insert.</strong> Lines are created with methods of the following
form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createLine(x1, y1..., xn, yn, ?option, value, option,
value, ...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em> through <em>yn</em> give the coordinates
for a series of two or more points that describe a series of connected
line segments. After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the
configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration. The following options are supported for lines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-arrow =&gt; where</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates whether or not arrowheads are to be drawn at one or both
ends of the line. <em>Where</em> must have one of the values
<strong>none</strong> (for no arrowheads), <strong>first</strong> (for

<dd>
<p>This option indicates how to draw arrowheads. The <em>shape</em>
argument must be a list with three elements, each specifying a distance
in any of the forms described in the COORDINATES section above. The
first element of the list gives the distance along the line from the
neck of the arrowhead to its tip. The second element gives the distance
along the line from the trailing points of the arrowhead to the tip, and
the third element gives the distance from the outside edge of the line
to the trailing points. If this option isn't specified then Tk picks a
``reasonable'' shape.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-capstyle =&gt; style</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the ways in which caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of
the line. <em>Style</em> may have any of the forms accepted by

specified then it defaults to <strong>miter</strong>. If the line only
contains two points then this option is irrelevant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-smooth =&gt; boolean</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Boolean</em> must have one of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetBoolean</strong>. It indicates whether or not the line
should be drawn as a curve. If so, the line is rendered as a set of
parabolic splines: one spline is drawn for the first and second line
segments, one for the second and third, and so on. Straight-line
segments can be generated within a curve by duplicating the end-points
of the desired line segment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-splinesteps =&gt; number</dt>

<h1>OVAL ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>oval</strong> appear as circular or oval
regions on the display. Each oval may have an outline, a fill, or both.
Ovals are created with methods of the following form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createOval(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value,
...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em>
give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular
region enclosing the oval. The oval will include the top and left edges
of the rectangle not the lower or right edges. If the region is square
then the resulting oval is circular; otherwise it is elongated in shape.
After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the

Straight-line segments can be generated in a smoothed polygon by
duplicating the end-points of the desired line segment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-splinesteps =&gt; number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the degree of smoothness desired for curves: each spline
will be approximated with <em>number</em> line segments. This option is
ignored unless the <strong>-smooth</strong> option is true.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-state =&gt; state</dt>
<dd>
<p>Modifies the state of the polygon item where <em>state</em> may be
set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden. A polygon item may also be
in the active state if the mouse is currently over it. Many options can
take separate specifications in normal, active and disabled states such
that the appearance of the item can be different in each state.</p>

<p>This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill
the the polygon in its normal, active and disabled states.
<em>bitmap</em> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the
forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. If <em>bitmap</em> is
an empty string (the default), then filling is done in a solid
fashion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-tags =&gt; tagList</dt>

consists of a list of tag names, which replace any existing tags for the
item. <em>TagList</em> may be an empty list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-updatecommand =&gt; command</dt>

<p>the polygon, in its normal, active and disabled states.
<em>outlineWidth</em> may be in any of the forms described in the
COORDINATES section above. <em>OutlineWidth</em> specifies the width of
the outline to be drawn around the polygon, in any of the forms
described in the COORDINATES section above. If the
<strong>-outline</strong> option hasn't been specified then this option
has no effect. This option defaults to 1.0. Polygon items are different
from other items such as rectangles, ovals and arcs in that interior
points are considered to be ``inside'' a polygon (e.g. for purposes of
the <strong>find closest</strong> and <strong>find overlapping</strong>
methods) even if it is not filled. For most other item types, an
interior point is considered to be inside the item only if the item is
filled or if it has neither a fill nor an outline. If you would like an
unfilled polygon whose interior points are not considered to be inside
the polygon, use a line item instead.</p>
<h1>RECTANGLE ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>rectangle</strong> appear as rectangular
regions on the display. Each rectangle may have an outline, a fill, or
both. Rectangles are created with methods of the following form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createRectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option,
value, ...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em>
give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle
(the rectangle will include its upper and left edges but not its lower
or right edges). After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the
configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration. The following options are supported for rectangles:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-dash =&gt; pattern</dt>

</dl>
<p>This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, the active
state, and the disabled state of a rectangle item. <em>pattern</em> may
have any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetDash</strong>. If the
dash options are omitted then the default is a solid outline.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-dashoffset =&gt; offset</dt>

has no effect. If <em>bitmap</em> is an empty string (the default), then
the outline is drawn in a solid fashion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-state =&gt; state</dt>
<dd>
<p>Modifies the state of the rectangle item where <em>state</em> may be
set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden. A rectangle item may also be

in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>OutlineWidth</em>
specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around the rectangle, in
any of the forms described in the COORDINATES section above. If the
<strong>-outline</strong> option hasn't been specified then this option
has no effect. Wide outlines are drawn centered on the rectangular path
defined by <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em>. This
option defaults to 1.0.</p>
<h1>TEXT ITEMS</h1>
<p>A text item displays a string of characters on the screen in one or
more lines. Text items support indexing and selection, along with the
following text-related canvas methods: <strong>dchars</strong>,
<strong>focus</strong>, <strong>icursor</strong>,
<strong>index</strong>, <strong>insert</strong>,
<strong>select</strong>. Text items are created with methods of the
following form:</p>
<p>$canvas-&gt;createText(x, y, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> specify the coordinates of a
point used to position the text on the display (see the options below
for more information on how text is displayed). After the coordinates
there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of
which sets one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration. The following options are supported for text items:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor =&gt; anchorPos</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>AnchorPos</em> tells how to position the text relative to the
positioning point for the text; it may have any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetAnchor</strong>. For example, if <em>anchorPos</em> is
<strong>center</strong> then the text is centered on the point; if
<em>anchorPos</em> is <strong>n</strong> then the text will be drawn
such that the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the
text will be at the positioning point. This option defaults to
<strong>center</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-fill =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-activefill =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>-disabledfill =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies the color to be used to fill the text in its normal,
active, and disabled states. <em>Color</em> may have any of the forms
accepted by <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>. If <em>color</em> is undef
then the text will be transparent. If this option isn't specified then
it defaults to <strong>black</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-font =&gt; fontName</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the font to use for the text item. <em>FontName</em> may be
any string acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetFontStruct</strong>. If this
option isn't specified, it defaults to a system-dependent font.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-justify =&gt; how</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how to justify the text within its bounding region.
<em>How</em> must be one of the values <strong>left</strong>,
<strong>right</strong>, or <strong>center</strong>. This option will
only matter if the text is displayed as multiple lines. If the option is
omitted, it defaults to <strong>left</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-state =&gt; state</dt>
<dd>
<p>Modifies the state of the text item where <em>state</em> may be set
to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden. A text item may also be in the
active state if the mouse is currently over it. Many options can take
separate specifications in normal, active and disabled states such that
the appearance of the item can be different in each state.</p>

<dt>-disabledstipple =&gt; bitmap</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill
the the text in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>bitmap</em>
specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. If <em>bitmap</em> is an empty string
(the default) then the text is drawn in a solid fashion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-tags =&gt; tagList</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item. <em>TagList</em>
consists of a list of tag names, which replace any existing tags for the
item. <em>TagList</em> may be an empty list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-text =&gt; string</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>String</em> specifies the characters to be displayed in the text
item. Newline characters cause line breaks. The characters in the item
may also be changed with the <strong>insert</strong> and
<strong>delete</strong> methods. This option defaults to an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-updatecommand =&gt; command</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the text item
is updated on the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-width =&gt; lineLength</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a maximum line length for the text, in any of the forms
described in the COORDINATES section above. If this option is zero (the
default) the text is broken into lines only at newline characters.
However, if this option is non-zero then any line that would be longer
than <em>lineLength</em> is broken just before a space character to make
the line shorter than <em>lineLength</em>; the space character is
treated as if it were a newline character.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>WINDOW ITEMS</h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>window</strong> cause a particular window to be
displayed at a given position on the canvas. Window items are created
with methods of the following form:</p>
<p>    <em><code>$canvas</code></em>-&gt;<strong>createWindow</strong>(<em>x,
y</em>?, <em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>,
<em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>, ...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> specify the coordinates of a
point used to position the window on the display (see the
<strong>-anchor</strong> option below for more information on how
bitmaps are displayed). After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option-value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration
options for the item. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs
may be used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> method to change the
item's configuration. The following options are supported for window
items:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor =&gt; anchorPos</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>AnchorPos</em> tells how to position the window relative to the
positioning point for the item; it may have any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetAnchor</strong>. For example, if <em>anchorPos</em> is
<strong>center</strong> then the window is centered on the point; if
<em>anchorPos</em> is <strong>n</strong> then the window will be drawn
so that its top center point is at the positioning point. This option
defaults to <strong>center</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-height =&gt; pixels</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the height to assign to the item's window. <em>Pixels</em>
may have any of the forms described in the COORDINATES section above. If
this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as an empty string,
then the window is given whatever height it requests internally.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-state =&gt; state</dt>
<dd>
<p>Modifies the state of the window item where <em>state</em> may be set
to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-tags =&gt; tagList</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item. <em>TagList</em>
consists of a list of tag names, which replace any existing tags for the
item. <em>TagList</em> may be an empty list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-updatecommand =&gt; command</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the window
item is updated on the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-width =&gt; pixels</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the width to assign to the item's window. <em>Pixels</em>
may have any of the forms described in the COORDINATES section above. If
this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as an empty string,
then the window is given whatever width it requests internally.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-window =&gt; $widget</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the window to associate with this item. The window
specified by <code>$widget</code> must either be a child of the canvas
widget or a child of some ancestor of the canvas widget.
<em>PathName</em> may not refer to a top-level window. Note: due to
restrictions in the ways that windows are managed, it is not possible to
draw other graphical items (such as lines and images) on top of window
items. A window item always obscures any graphics that overlap it,
regardless of their order in the display list.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>APPLICATION-DEFINED ITEM TYPES</h1>
<p>It is possible for individual applications to define new item types
for canvas widgets using C code. See the documentation for
<strong>Tk_CreateItemType</strong>.</p>
<h1>BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Canvas has default bindings to allow scrolling if necessary:
&lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, &lt;Left&gt; and &lt;Right&gt; (and their
&lt;Control-*&gt; counter parts). Further &lt;Proir&gt;, &lt;Next&gt;,
&lt;Home&gt; and &lt;End&gt;. These bindings allow you to navigate the
same way as in other widgets that can scroll.</p>
<h1>Perl/Tk Methods</h1>
<p>The following methods are added as perl code:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$canvas-&gt;get_corners</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the bounding box in Canvas coordinates of the visible portion
of the Canvas. (Written by Slaven Rezic.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CREDITS</h1>
<p>Tk's canvas widget is a blatant ripoff of ideas from Joel Bartlett's
<em>ezd</em> program. <em>Ezd</em> provides structured graphics in a
Scheme environment and preceded canvases by a year or two. Its simple
mechanisms for placing and animating graphical objects inspired the
functions of canvases.</p>
