<h1>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Name: command</dt>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Command</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -command</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a perl/Tk callback to associate with the button. This
command is typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the
button window. The button's global variable (<strong>-variable</strong>
option) will be updated before the command is invoked.</p>
<dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Height</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -height</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a desired height for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units (i.e.
any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for text
it is in lines of text. If this option isn't specified, the button's
desired height is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text
being displayed in it.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: indicatorOn</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: IndicatorOn</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -indicatoron</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies whether or not the indicator should be drawn. Must be a
proper boolean value. If false, the <strong>relief</strong> option is
ignored and the widget's relief is always sunken if the widget is
selected and raised otherwise.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Command-Line Name: -offrelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Database Name: offRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Database Class: OffRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies the relief for the checkbutton when the indicator is not
drawn and the checkbutton is off. The default value is
<strong>raised</strong>. By setting this option to <strong>flat</strong>
and setting <strong>-indicatoron false -overrelief raised</strong>, the
effect is achieved of having a flat button that raises on mouse-over and
which is depressed when activated. This is the behavior typically
exhibited by the Bold, Italic, and Underline checkbuttons on the toolbar
of a word-processor, for example.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Command-Line Name: -overrelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Database Name: overRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Database Class: OverRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies an alternative relief for the button, to be used when the
mouse cursor is over the widget. This option can be used to make toolbar
buttons, by configuring <strong>-relief flat -overrelief</strong>
raised. If the value of this option is the empty string, then no
alternative relief is used when the mouse cursor is over the button. The
empty string is the default value.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: selectColor</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Background</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -selectcolor</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a background color to use when the button is selected. If
<strong>indicatorOn</strong> is true then the color applies to the
indicator. Under Windows, this color is used as the background for the
indicator regardless of the select state. If
<strong>indicatorOn</strong> is false, this color is used as the
background for the entire widget, in place of
<strong>background</strong> or <strong>activeBackground</strong>,
whenever the widget is selected. If specified as an empty string then no
special color is used for displaying when the widget is selected.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: selectImage</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: SelectImage</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -selectimage</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies an image to display (in place of the <strong>image</strong>
option) when the radiobutton is selected. This option is ignored unless
the <strong>image</strong> option has been specified.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: state</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: State</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -state</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the radiobutton:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>, or
<strong>disabled</strong>. In normal state the radiobutton is displayed
using the <strong>foreground</strong> and <strong>background</strong>
options. The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the
radiobutton. In active state the radiobutton is displayed using the
<strong>activeForeground</strong> and <strong>activeBackground</strong>
options. Disabled state means that the radiobutton should be
insensitive: the default bindings will refuse to activate the widget and
will ignore mouse button presses. In this state the
<strong>disabledForeground</strong> and <strong>background</strong>
options determine how the radiobutton is displayed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: value</dt>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Value</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -value</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies value to store in the button's associated variable whenever
this button is selected.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: variable</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Variable</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -variable</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies reference to a variable to set whenever this button is
selected. Changes in this variable also cause the button to select or
deselect itself. Defaults to the value
<code>\$Tk::selectedButton</code>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button, the value is in screen units (i.e. any of
the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for text it is
in characters. If this option isn't specified, the button's desired
width is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text being
displayed in it.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Radiobutton</strong> method creates a new window (given
by the <code>$widget</code> argument) and makes it into a radiobutton
widget. Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the
radiobutton such as its colors, font, text, and initial relief. The
<strong>radiobutton</strong> command returns its <code>$widget</code>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <code>$widget</code>, but <code>$widget</code>'s parent
must exist.</p>
<p>A radiobutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or
image and a diamond or circle called an <em>indicator</em>. If text is
displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it can occupy multiple
lines on the screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs
because of the <strong>wrapLength</strong> option) and one of the
characters may optionally be underlined using the
<strong>underline</strong> option. A radiobutton has all of the behavior
of a simple button: it can display itself in either of three different
ways, according to the <strong>state</strong> option; it can be made to
appear raised, sunken, or flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes
a perl/Tk callback whenever mouse button 1 is clicked over the check
button.</p>
<p>In addition, radiobuttons can be <em>selected</em>. If a radiobutton
is selected, the indicator is normally drawn with a selected appearance,
and a Tcl variable associated with the radiobutton is set to a
particular value (normally 1). Under Unix, the indicator is drawn with a
sunken relief and a special color. Under Windows, the indicator is drawn
with a round mark inside. If the radiobutton is not selected, then the
indicator is drawn with a deselected appearance, and the associated
variable is set to a different value (typically 0). Under Unix, the
indicator is drawn with a raised relief and no special color. Under
Windows, the indicator is drawn without a round mark inside. Typically,
several radiobuttons share a single variable and the value of the
variable indicates which radiobutton is to be selected. When a
radiobutton is selected it sets the value of the variable to indicate
that fact; each radiobutton also monitors the value of the variable and
automatically selects and deselects itself when the variable's value
changes. By default the variable <strong>selectedButton</strong> is
used; its contents give the name of the button that is selected, or the
empty string if no button associated with that variable is selected. The
name of the variable for a radiobutton, plus the variable to be stored
into it, may be modified with options on the command line or in the
option database. Configuration options may also be used to modify the
way the indicator is displayed (or whether it is displayed at all). By
default a radiobutton is configured to select itself on button
clicks.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Radiobutton</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for radiobutton
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$radiobutton-&gt;deselect</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deselects the radiobutton and sets the associated variable to an
empty string. If this radiobutton was not currently selected, the
command has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$radiobutton-&gt;flash</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flashes the radiobutton. This is accomplished by redisplaying the
radiobutton several times, alternating between active and normal colors.
At the end of the flash the radiobutton is left in the same
normal/active state as when the command was invoked. This command is
ignored if the radiobutton's state is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$radiobutton-&gt;invoke</dt>
<dd>
<p>Does just what would have happened if the user invoked the
radiobutton with the mouse: selects the button and invokes its
associated Tcl command, if there is one. The return value is the return
value from the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is no command
associated with the radiobutton. This command is ignored if the
radiobutton's state is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$radiobutton-&gt;select</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects the radiobutton and sets the associated variable to the value
corresponding to this widget.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for radiobuttons that give
them the following default behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>On Unix systems, a radiobutton activates whenever the mouse passes
over it and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the radiobutton. On
Mac and Windows systems, when mouse button 1 is pressed over a
radiobutton, the button activates whenever the mouse pointer is inside
the button, and deactivates whenever the mouse pointer leaves the
button.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When mouse button 1 is pressed over a radiobutton it is invoked (it
becomes selected and the command associated with the button is invoked,
if there is one).</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When a radiobutton has the input focus, the space key causes the
radiobutton to be invoked. If the radiobutton's state is
<strong>disabled</strong> then none of the above actions occur: the
radiobutton is completely non-responsive. The behavior of radiobuttons
can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by
redefining the class bindings.</p>
