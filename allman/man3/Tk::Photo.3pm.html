<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Photo - Full-color images</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>    <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Photo</strong>(?<em>name</em>??,
<em>options</em>?)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A photo is an image whose pixels can display any color or be
transparent. A photo image is stored internally in full color (32 bits
per pixel), and is displayed using dithering if necessary. Image data
for a photo image can be obtained from a file or a string, or it can be
supplied from C code through a procedural interface. At present, only
GIF, XBM, XPM, BMP, JPEG, PNG and PPM/PGM formats are supported, but an
interface exists to allow additional image file formats to be added
easily. A photo image is transparent in regions where no image data has
been supplied or where it has been set transparent by the
<strong>transparencySet</strong> subcommand.</p>
<h1>CREATING PHOTOS</h1>
<p>Photos are created using the <strong>Photo</strong> method.
<strong>Photo</strong> supports the following <em>options</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-data =&gt; string</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the contents of the image as a string. The string can
contain base64 encoded data or binary data. The format of the string
must be one of those for which there is an image file format handler
that will accept string data. If both the <strong>-data</strong> and
<strong>-file</strong> options are specified, the <strong>-file</strong>
option takes precedence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-format =&gt; format-name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the file format for the data specified with the
<strong>-data</strong> or <strong>-file</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-file =&gt; name</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>name</em> gives the name of a file that is to be read to supply
data for the photo image. The file format must be one of those for which
there is an image file format handler that can read data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-gamma =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the colors allocated for displaying this image in a
window should be corrected for a non-linear display with the specified
gamma exponent value. (The intensity produced by most CRT displays is a
power function of the input value, to a good approximation; gamma is the
exponent and is typically around 2). The value specified must be greater
than zero. The default value is one (no correction). In general, values
greater than one will make the image lighter, and values less than one
will make it darker.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-height =&gt; number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the height of the image, in pixels. This option is useful
primarily in situations where the user wishes to build up the contents
of the image piece by piece. A value of zero (the default) allows the
image to expand or shrink vertically to fit the data stored in it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-palette =&gt; palette-spec</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the resolution of the color cube to be allocated for
displaying this image, and thus the number of colors used from the
colormaps of the windows where it is displayed. The
<em>palette-spec</em> string may be either a single decimal number,
specifying the number of shades of gray to use, or three decimal numbers
separated by slashes (/), specifying the number of shades of red, green
and blue to use, respectively. If the first form (a single number) is
used, the image will be displayed in monochrome (i.e., grayscale).</p>
</dd>
<dt>-width =&gt; number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the width of the image, in pixels. This option is useful
primarily in situations where the user wishes to build up the contents
of the image piece by piece. A value of zero (the default) allows the
image to expand or shrink horizontally to fit the data stored in it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>IMAGE METHODS</h1>
<p>When a photo image is created, Tk also creates a new object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above.</p>
<p>Those options that write data to the image generally expand the size
of the image, if necessary, to accommodate the data written to the
image, unless the user has specified non-zero values for the
<strong>-width</strong> and/or <strong>-height</strong> configuration
options, in which case the width and/or height, respectively, of the
image will not be changed.</p>
<p>The following addition methods are available for photo images:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$image-&gt;blank</dt>
<dd>
<p>Blank the image; that is, set the entire image to have no data, so it
will be displayed as transparent, and the background of whatever window
it is displayed in will show through.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;copy(sourceImage ?,option value(s) ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Copies a region from the image called
<em><code>$sourceImage</code></em> (which must be a photo image) to the
image called <em><code>$image</code></em>, possibly with pixel zooming
and/or subsampling. If no options are specified, this method copies the
whole of <em><code>$sourceImage</code></em> into
<em><code>$image</code></em>, starting at coordinates (0,0) in
<em><code>$image</code></em>. The following options may be
specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-from =&gt; x1, y1, ? ,x2, y2?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the source image to be copied.
(<em>x1,y1</em>) and (<em>x2,y2</em>) specify diagonally opposite
corners of the rectangle. If <em>x2</em> and <em>y2</em> are not
specified, the default value is the bottom-right corner of the source
image. The pixels copied will include the left and top edges of the
specified rectangle but not the bottom or right edges. If the
<strong>-from</strong> option is not given, the default is the whole
source image.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-to =&gt; x1, y1, ?, x2, y2?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the destination image to be
affected. (<em>x1,y1</em>) and (<em>x2,y2</em>) specify diagonally
opposite corners of the rectangle. If <em>x2</em> and <em>y2</em> are
not specified, the default value is (<em>x1,y1</em>) plus the size of
the source region (after subsampling and zooming, if specified). If
<em>x2</em> and <em>y2</em> are specified, the source region will be
replicated if necessary to fill the destination region in a tiled
fashion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-shrink</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the size of the destination image should be reduced,
if necessary, so that the region being copied into is at the
bottom-right corner of the image. This option will not affect the width
or height of the image if the user has specified a non-zero value for
the <strong>-width</strong> or <strong>-height</strong> configuration
option, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-zoom =&gt; x, y</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the source region should be magnified by a factor of
<em>x</em> in the X direction and <em>y</em> in the Y direction. If
<em>y</em> is not given, the default value is the same as <em>x</em>.
With this option, each pixel in the source image will be expanded into a
block of <em>x</em> x <em>y</em> pixels in the destination image, all
the same color. <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> must be greater than 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-subsample =&gt; x, y</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the source image should be reduced in size by using
only every <em>x</em>th pixel in the X direction and <em>y</em>th pixel
in the Y direction. Negative values will cause the image to be flipped
about the Y or X axes, respectively. If <em>y</em> is not given, the
default value is the same as <em>x</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-compositingrule =&gt; rule</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how transparent pixels in the source image are combined
with the destination image. When a compositing rule of <em>overlay</em>
is set, the old contents of the destination image are visible, as if the
source image were printed on a piece of transparent film and placed over
the top of the destination. When a compositing rule of <em>set</em> is
set, the old contents of the destination image are discarded and the
source image is used as-is. The default compositing rule is
<em>overlay</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;data(?option value(s), ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns image data in the form of a string. The following options may
be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-background =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the color is specified, the data will not contain any transparency
information. In all transparent pixels the color will be replaced by the
specified color.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-format =&gt; format-name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the image file format handler to be used.
Specifically, this method searches for the first handler whose name
matches a initial substring of <em>format-name</em> and which has the
capability to read this image data. If this option is not given, this
method uses the first handler that has the capability to read the image
data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-from =&gt; x1, y1, ?, x2, y2?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular region of <em><code>$image</code></em> to be
returned. If only <em>x1</em> and <em>y1</em> are specified, the region
extends from <em>(x1,y1)</em> to the bottom-right corner of
<em><code>$image</code></em>. If all four coordinates are given, they
specify diagonally opposite corners of the rectangular region, including
x1,y1 and excluding x2,y2. The default, if this option is not given, is
the whole image.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-grayscale</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this options is specified, the data will not contain color
information. All pixel data will be transformed into grayscale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;get(x, y)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the color of the pixel at coordinates (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)
in the image as a list of three integers between 0 and 255, representing
the red, green and blue components respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;put(data ?,-format=&gt;format-name? ?,-to=&gt; x1 y1 ?x2
y2??)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets pixels in <em><code>$image</code></em> to the data specified in
<em>data</em>. This command first searches the list of image file format
handlers for a handler that can interpret the data in <em>data</em>, and
then reads the image encoded within into <em><code>$image</code></em>
(the destination image). If <em>data</em> does not match any known
format, an attempt to interpret it as a (top-to-bottom) list of
scan-lines is made, with each scan-line being a (left-to-right) list of
pixel colors (see <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong> for a description of
valid colors.) Every scan-line must be of the same length. Note that
when <em>data</em> is a single color name, you are instructing Tk to
fill a rectangular region with that color. The following options may be
specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-format =&gt;format-name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the format of the image data in <em>data</em>.
Specifically, only image file format handlers whose names begin with
<em>format-name</em> will be used while searching for an image data
format handler to read the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-to =&gt;x, y ?, x2, y2?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the coordinates of the top-left corner
(<em>x1</em>,<em>y1</em>) of the region of <em><code>$image</code></em>
into which data from <em>filename</em> are to be read. The default is
(0,0). If <em>x2</em>,<em>y2</em> is given and <em>data</em> is not
large enough to cover the rectangle specified by this option, the image
data extracted will be tiled so it covers the entire destination
rectangle. Note that if <em>data</em> specifies a single color value,
then a region extending to the bottom-right corner represented by
(<em>x2</em>,<em>y2</em>) will be filled with that color.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;read(filename ?,option value(s), ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Reads image data from the file named <em>filename</em> into the
image. This method first searches the list of image file format handlers
for a handler that can interpret the data in <em>filename</em>, and then
reads the image in <em>filename</em> into <em><code>$image</code></em>
(the destination image). The following options may be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-format =&gt; format-name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the format of the image data in <em>filename</em>.
Specifically, only image file format handlers whose names begin with
<em>format-name</em> will be used while searching for an image data
format handler to read the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-from =&gt; x1, y1, x2, y2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the image file data to be
copied to the destination image. If only <em>x1</em> and <em>y1</em> are
specified, the region extends from (<em>x1,y1</em>) to the bottom-right
corner of the image in the image file. If all four coordinates are
specified, they specify diagonally opposite corners or the region. The
default, if this option is not specified, is the whole of the image in
the image file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-shrink</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is specified, the size of <em><code>$image</code></em>
will be reduced, if necessary, so that the region into which the image
file data are read is at the bottom-right corner of the
<em><code>$image</code></em>. This option will not affect the width or
height of the image if the user has specified a non-zero value for the
<strong>-width</strong> or <strong>-height</strong> configuration
option, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-to =&gt; x, y</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the coordinates of the top-left corner of the region of
<em><code>$image</code></em> into which data from <em>filename</em> are
to be read. The default is (0,0).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;redither</dt>
<dd>
<p>The dithering algorithm used in displaying photo images propagates
quantization errors from one pixel to its neighbors. If the image data
for <em><code>$image</code></em> is supplied in pieces, the dithered
image may not be exactly correct. Normally the difference is not
noticeable, but if it is a problem, this method can be used to
recalculate the dithered image in each window where the image is
displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;transparency(subcommand, ?arg, arg ...?);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows examination and manipulation of the transparency information
in the photo image. Several subcommands are available:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$image-&gt;transparencyGet(x, y);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a boolean indicating if the pixel at (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)
is transparent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;transparencySet(x, y, boolean);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes the pixel at (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) transparent if
<em>boolean</em> is true, and makes that pixel opaque otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$image-&gt;write(filename ?,option value(s), ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Writes image data from <em><code>$image</code></em> to a file named
<em>filename</em>. The following options may be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-background =&gt; color</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the color is specified, the data will not contain any transparency
information. In all transparent pixels the color will be replaced by the
specified color.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-format =&gt; format-name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the image file format handler to be used to
write the data to the file. Specifically, this subcommand searches for
the first handler whose name matches a initial substring of
<em>format-name</em> and which has the capability to write an image
file. If this option is not given, this subcommand uses the first
handler that has the capability to write an image file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-from =&gt; x1, y1, ?, x2, y2?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular region of <em><code>$image</code></em> to be
written to the image file. If only <em>x1</em> and <em>y1</em> are
specified, the region extends from <em>(x1,y1)</em> to the bottom-right
corner of <em><code>$image</code></em>. If all four coordinates are
given, they specify diagonally opposite corners of the rectangular
region. The default, if this option is not given, is the whole
image.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-grayscale</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this options is specified, the data will not contain color
information. All pixel data will be transformed into grayscale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>IMAGE FORMATS</h1>
<p>The photo image code is structured to allow handlers for additional
image file formats to be added easily. The photo image code maintains a
list of these handlers. Handlers are added to the list by registering
them with a call to <strong>Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat</strong>. The
standard Tk distribution comes with handlers for XBM, XPM, BMP, JPEG,
PNG and PPM/PGM formats, which are automatically registered on
initialization.</p>
<p>When reading an image file or processing string data specified with
the <strong>-data</strong> configuration option, the photo image code
invokes each handler in turn until one is found that claims to be able
to read the data in the file or string. Usually this will find the
correct handler, but if it doesn't, the user may give a format name with
the <strong>-format</strong> option to specify which handler to use. In
fact the photo image code will try those handlers whose names begin with
the string specified for the <strong>-format</strong> option (the
comparison is case-insensitive). For example, if the user specifies
<strong>-format</strong> <strong>=&gt;</strong> <strong>gif</strong>,
then a handler named GIF87 or GIF89 may be invoked, but a handler named
JPEG may not (assuming that such handlers had been registered).</p>
<p>When writing image data to a file, the processing of the
<strong>-format</strong> option is slightly different: the string value
given for the <strong>-format</strong> option must begin with the
complete name of the requested handler, and may contain additional
information following that, which the handler can use, for example, to
specify which variant to use of the formats supported by the handler.
Note that not all image handlers may support writing transparency data
to a file, even where the target image format does.</p>
<h1>COLOR ALLOCATION</h1>
<p>When a photo image is displayed in a window, the photo image code
allocates colors to use to display the image and dithers the image, if
necessary, to display a reasonable approximation to the image using the
colors that are available. The colors are allocated as a color cube,
that is, the number of colors allocated is the product of the number of
shades of red, green and blue.</p>
<p>Normally, the number of colors allocated is chosen based on the depth
of the window. For example, in an 8-bit PseudoColor window, the photo
image code will attempt to allocate seven shades of red, seven shades of
green and four shades of blue, for a total of 198 colors. In a 1-bit
StaticGray (monochrome) window, it will allocate two colors, black and
white. In a 24-bit DirectColor or TrueColor window, it will allocate 256
shades each of red, green and blue. Fortunately, because of the way that
pixel values can be combined in DirectColor and TrueColor windows, this
only requires 256 colors to be allocated. If not all of the colors can
be allocated, the photo image code reduces the number of shades of each
primary color and tries again.</p>
<p>The user can exercise some control over the number of colors that a
photo image uses with the <strong>-palette</strong> configuration
option. If this option is used, it specifies the maximum number of
shades of each primary color to try to allocate. It can also be used to
force the image to be displayed in shades of gray, even on a color
display, by giving a single number rather than three numbers separated
by slashes.</p>
<h1>CREDITS</h1>
<p>The photo image type was designed and implemented by Paul Mackerras,
based on his earlier photo widget and some suggestions from John
Ousterhout.</p>
