<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::WinPhoto - Load a Photo image from a window</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk; use Tk::WinPhoto; my $image = $mw-&gt;Photo(-format =&gt;
Window, -data =&gt; oct($mw-&gt;id)); $image-&gt;write($path_name,
-format =&gt; BMP|PPM|XPM);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This is an extension for Tk800.* which will load a Photo image from a
snapshot of an X window specified by the -data option.</p>
<p>The window must exist and be visible. Because the code allows you to
capture windows not owned by Tk it does not attempt to enforce this. If
you are capturing one of Tk's windows then use
<code>$w-&gt;update</code>.</p>
<p>If window is mapped, but obscured by other windows then what is
captured is the rectangle the window would occupy. This can be
considered a feature. For Tk-owned windows <code>$w-&gt;raise</code> can
used to bring window forward.</p>
<p>Once the Photo is loaded it can be saved using
<code>$image-&gt;write(-format =&gt; ...)</code> using any of formats
which support writing.</p>
