<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>IO::WrapTie - wrap tieable objects in IO::Handle interface</p>
<p>This is currently Alpha code, released for comments. Please give me
your feedback!</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>First of all, you'll need <strong>tie()</strong>, so:</p>
<p>require 5.004;</p>
<p><em>Function interface (experimental).</em> Use this with any
existing class...</p>
<p>use IO::WrapTie; use FooHandle; ### implements TIEHANDLE interface
### Suppose we want a "FooHandle-&gt;new(&amp;FOO_RDWR, 2)". ### We can
instead say... $FH = wraptie(FooHandle, &amp;FOO_RDWR, 2); ### Now we
can use... print $FH "Hello, "; ### traditional operator syntax...
$FH-&gt;print("world!\n"); ### ...and OO syntax as well!</p>
<p><em>OO interface (preferred).</em> You can inherit from the
IO::WrapTie::Slave mixin to get a nifty <code>new_tie()</code>
constructor...</p>
<p>#------------------------------ package FooHandle; ### a class which
can TIEHANDLE use IO::WrapTie; @ISA = qw(IO::WrapTie::Slave); ###
inherit new_tie() ... #------------------------------ package main; $FH
= FooHandle-&gt;new_tie(&amp;FOO_RDWR, 2); ### $FH is an
IO::WrapTie::Master print $FH "Hello, "; ### traditional operator syntax
$FH-&gt;print("world!\n"); ### OO syntax</p>
<p>See IO::Scalar as an example. It also shows you how to create classes
which work both with and without 5.004.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Suppose you have a class <code>FooHandle</code>, where...</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>FooHandle does not inherit from IO::Handle;</strong> that
is, it performs filehandle-like I/O, but to something other than an
underlying file descriptor. Good examples are IO::Scalar (for printing
to a string) and IO::Lines (for printing to an array of lines).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FooHandle implements the TIEHANDLE interface</strong>
(see perltie); that is, it provides methods TIEHANDLE, GETC, PRINT,
PRINTF, READ, and READLINE.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FooHandle implements the traditional OO
interface</strong> of FileHandle and IO::Handle; i.e., it contains
methods like <strong>getline()</strong>, <strong>read()</strong>,
<strong>print()</strong>, <strong>seek()</strong>,
<strong>tell()</strong>, <strong>eof()</strong>, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, users of your class would have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use only OO syntax,</strong> and forsake named I/O
operators like 'print'.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use with tie,</strong> and forsake treating it as a
first-class object (i.e., class-specific methods can only be invoked
through the underlying object via <strong>tied()</strong>... giving the
object a split personality).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But now with IO::WrapTie, you can say:</p>
<p>$WT = wraptie(FooHandle, &amp;FOO_RDWR, 2); $WT-&gt;print("Hello,
world\n"); ### OO syntax print $WT "Yes!\n"; ### Named operator syntax
too! $WT-&gt;weird_stuff; ### Other methods!</p>
<p>And if you're authoring a class like FooHandle, just have it inherit
from <code>IO::WrapTie::Slave</code> and that first line becomes even
prettier:</p>
<p>$WT = FooHandle-&gt;new_tie(&amp;FOO_RDWR, 2);</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> now, almost any class can look and
work exactly like an IO::Handle... and be used both with OO and non-OO
filehandle syntax.</p>
<h1>HOW IT ALL WORKS</h1>
<h2>The data structures</h2>
<p>Consider this example code, using classes in this distribution:</p>
<p>use IO::Scalar; use IO::WrapTie; $WT = wraptie(IO::Scalar,\$s); print
$WT "Hello, "; $WT-&gt;print("world!\n");</p>
<p>In it, the <strong>wraptie()</strong> function creates a data
structure as follows:</p>
<p>* $WT is a blessed reference to a tied filehandle $WT glob; that glob
is tied to the "Slave" object. | * You would do all your i/o with $WT
directly. | | | ,---isa--&gt; IO::WrapTie::Master &gt;--isa--&gt;
IO::Handle V / .-------------. | | | | * Perl i/o operators work on the
tied object, | "Master" | invoking the TIEHANDLE methods. | | * Method
invocations are delegated to the tied | | slave. `------------- |
tied(*$WT) | .---isa--&gt; IO::WrapTie::Slave V / .-------------. | | |
"Slave" | * Instance of FileHandle-like class which doesnt | | actually
use file descriptors, like IO::Scalar. | IO::Scalar | * The slave can be
any kind of object. | | * Must implement the TIEHANDLE interface.
`-------------</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> just as an IO::Handle is really just a blessed
reference to a <em>traditional</em> filehandle glob... so also, an
IO::WrapTie::Master is really just a blessed reference to a filehandle
glob <em>which has been tied to some slave class.</em></p>
<h2>How <strong>wraptie()</strong> works</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The call to function <code>wraptie(SLAVECLASS, TIEARGS...)</code>
is passed onto <code>IO::WrapTie::Master::new()</code>. Note that class
IO::WrapTie::Master is a subclass of IO::Handle.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>IO::WrapTie::Master::new</code> method creates a new
IO::Handle object, reblessed into class IO::WrapTie::Master. This object
is the <em>master</em>, which will be returned from the constructor. At
the same time...</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>new</code> method also creates the <em>slave</em>: this
is an instance of SLAVECLASS which is created by tying the master's
IO::Handle to SLAVECLASS via
<code>tie(HANDLE, SLAVECLASS, TIEARGS...)</code>. This call to
<code>tie()</code> creates the slave in the following manner:</p></li>
<li><p>Class SLAVECLASS is sent the message
<code>TIEHANDLE(TIEARGS...)</code>; it will usually delegate this to
<code>SLAVECLASS::new(TIEARGS...)</code>, resulting in a new instance of
SLAVECLASS being created and returned.</p></li>
<li><p>Once both master and slave have been created, the master is
returned to the caller.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>How I/O operators work (on the master)</h2>
<p>Consider using an i/o operator on the master:</p>
<p>print $WT "Hello, world!\n";</p>
<p>Since the master ($WT) is really a [blessed] reference to a glob, the
normal Perl i/o operators like <code>print</code> may be used on it.
They will just operate on the symbol part of the glob.</p>
<p>Since the glob is tied to the slave, the slave's PRINT method (part
of the TIEHANDLE interface) will be automatically invoked.</p>
<p>If the slave is an IO::Scalar, that means IO::Scalar::PRINT will be
invoked, and that method happens to delegate to the <code>print()</code>
method of the same class. So the <em>real</em> work is ultimately done
by <strong>IO::Scalar::print()</strong>.</p>
<h2>How methods work (on the master)</h2>
<p>Consider using a method on the master:</p>
<p>$WT-&gt;print("Hello, world!\n");</p>
<p>Since the master ($WT) is blessed into the class IO::WrapTie::Master,
Perl first attempts to find a <code>print()</code> method there. Failing
that, Perl next attempts to find a <code>print()</code> method in the
superclass, IO::Handle. It just so happens that there <em>is</em> such a
method; that method merely invokes the <code>print</code> i/o operator
on the self object... and for that, see above!</p>
<p>But let's suppose we're dealing with a method which <em>isn't</em>
part of IO::Handle... for example:</p>
<p>my $sref = $WT-&gt;sref;</p>
<p>In this case, the intuitive behavior is to have the master delegate
the method invocation to the slave (now do you see where the
designations come from?). This is indeed what happens:
IO::WrapTie::Master contains an AUTOLOAD method which performs the
delegation.</p>
<p>So: when <code>sref()</code> can't be found in IO::Handle, the
AUTOLOAD method of IO::WrapTie::Master is invoked, and the standard
behavior of delegating the method to the underlying slave (here, an
IO::Scalar) is done.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to get this to work properly, you may need to create a
subclass of IO::WrapTie::Master which is an effective master for
<em>your</em> class, and do the delegation there.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p><strong>Why not simply use the object's OO interface?</strong>
Because that means forsaking the use of named operators like
<strong>print()</strong>, and you may need to pass the object to a
subroutine which will attempt to use those operators:</p>
<p>$O = FooHandle-&gt;new(&amp;FOO_RDWR, 2); $O-&gt;print("Hello,
world\n"); ### OO syntax is okay, BUT.... sub nope { print $_[0]
"Nope!\n" } X nope($O); ### ERROR!!! (not a glob ref)</p>
<p><strong>Why not simply use tie()?</strong> Because (1) you have to
use <strong>tied()</strong> to invoke methods in the object's public
interface (yuck), and (2) you may need to pass the tied symbol to
another subroutine which will attempt to treat it in an OO-way... and
that will break it:</p>
<p>tie *T, FooHandle, &amp;FOO_RDWR, 2; print T "Hello, world\n"; ###
Operator is okay, BUT... tied(*T)-&gt;other_stuff; ### yuck! AND... sub
nope { shift-&gt;print("Nope!\n") } X nope(\*T); ### ERROR!!! (method
"print" on unblessed ref)</p>
<p><strong>Why a master and slave?</strong> Why not simply write
FooHandle to inherit from IO::Handle? I tried this, with an
implementation similar to that of IO::Socket. The problem is that
<em>the whole point is to use this with objects</em> that don't have an
underlying file/socket descriptor.. Subclassing IO::Handle will work
fine for the OO stuff, and fine with named operators <em>if</em> you
<strong>tie()</strong>... but if you just attempt to say:</p>
<p>$IO = FooHandle-&gt;new(&amp;FOO_RDWR, 2); print $IO "Hello!\n";</p>
<p>you get a warning from Perl like:</p>
<p>Filehandle GEN001 never opened</p>
<p>because it's trying to do system-level i/o on an (unopened) file
descriptor. To avoid this, you apparently have to <strong>tie()</strong>
the handle... which brings us right back to where we started! At least
the IO::WrapTie mixin lets us say:</p>
<p>$IO = FooHandle-&gt;new_tie(&amp;FOO_RDWR, 2); print $IO
"Hello!\n";</p>
<p>and so is not <em>too</em> bad. <code>:-)</code></p>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p>Remember: this stuff is for doing FileHandle-like i/o on things
<em>without underlying file descriptors</em>. If you have an underlying
file descriptor, you're better off just inheriting from IO::Handle.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware that new_tie() always returns an instance of
a</strong> kind of IO::WrapTie::Master... it does <strong>not</strong>
return an instance of the i/o class you're tying to!</p>
<p>Invoking some methods on the master object causes AUTOLOAD to
delegate them to the slave object... so it <em>looks</em> like you're
manipulating a FooHandle object directly, but you're not.</p>
<p>I have not explored all the ramifications of this use of
<strong>tie()</strong>. <em>Here there be dragons</em>.</p>
