<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Central to this interface is a simple `result' structure reflecting
an `item' plus its value (in a union with standard C language types as
members). All `result' structures are automatically allocated and
provided by the library.</p>
<p>By specifying an array of `items', these structures can be organized
as a `stack', potentially yielding many results with a single function
call. Thus, a `stack' can be viewed as a variable length record whose
content and order is determined solely by the user.</p>
<p>As part of this interface there are two unique enumerators. The
`noop' and `extra' items exist to hold user values. They are never set
by the library, but the `extra' result will be zeroed with each library
interaction.</p>
<p>The pids.h file will be an essential document during user program
development. There you will find available items, their return type (the
`result' struct member name) and the source for such values. Additional
enumerators and structures are also documented there.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The following would be a typical sequence of calls to this
interface.</p>
<pre><code>1. fatal_proc_unmounted()
2. procps_pids_new()
3. procps_pids_get(), procps_pids_reap() or procps_pids_select()
4. procps_pids_unref()</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>get</strong> function is an iterator for successive
PIDs/TIDs, returning those `items' previously identified via
<strong>new</strong> or <strong>reset</strong>.</p>
<p>Two functions support unpredictable variable outcomes. The
<strong>reap</strong> function gathers data for all processes while the
<strong>select</strong> function deals with specific PIDs or UIDs. Both
can return multiple `stacks' each containing multiple `result'
structures. Optionally, a user may choose to <strong>sort</strong> such
results</p>
<p>To exploit any `stack', and access individual `result' structures, a
<em>relative_enum</em> is required as shown in the <strong>VAL</strong>
macro defined in the header file. Such values could be hard coded as: 0
through numitems-1. However, this need is typically satisfied by
creating your own enumerators corresponding to the order of the `items'
array.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>The &lt;pids&gt; API differs from others in that those items of
interest must be provided at <strong>new</strong> or
<strong>reset</strong> time, the latter being unique to this API. If
either the <em>items</em> or <em>numitems</em> parameter is zero at
<strong>new</strong> time, then <strong>reset</strong> becomes mandatory
before issuing any other call.</p>
<p>For the <strong>new</strong> and <strong>unref</strong> functions,
the address of an <em>info</em> struct pointer must be supplied. With
<strong>new</strong> it must have been initialized to NULL. With
<strong>unref</strong> it will be reset to NULL if the reference count
reaches zero.</p>
<p>The <strong>get</strong> and <strong>reap</strong> functions use the
<em>which</em> parameter to specify whether just tasks or both tasks and
threads are to be fetched.</p>
<p>The <strong>select</strong> function requires an array of PIDs or
UIDs as <em>these</em> along with <em>numthese</em> to identify which
processes are to be fetched. This function then operates as a subset of
<strong>reap</strong>.</p>
<p>When using the <strong>sort</strong> function, the parameters
<em>stacks</em> and <em>numstacked</em> would normally be those returned
in the `pids_fetch' structure.</p>
<p>Lastly, a <strong>fatal_proc_unmounted</strong> function may be
called before any other function to ensure that the /proc/ directory is
mounted. As such, the <em>info</em> parameter would be NULL and the
<em>return_self</em> parameter zero. If, however, some items are desired
for the issuing program (a <em>return_self</em> other than zero) then
the <strong>new</strong> call must precede it to identify the
<em>items</em> and obtain the required <em>info</em> pointer.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<h2>Functions Returning an `int'</h2>
<p>An error will be indicated by a negative number that is always the
inverse of some well known errno.h value.</p>
<p>Success is indicated by a zero return value. However, the
<strong>ref</strong> and <strong>unref</strong> functions return the
current <em>info</em> structure reference count.</p>
<h2>Functions Returning an `address'</h2>
<p>An error will be indicated by a NULL return pointer with the reason
found in the formal errno value.</p>
<p>Success is indicated by a pointer to the named structure. However, if
one survives the <strong>fatal_proc_unmounted</strong> call, NULL is
always returned when <em>return_self</em> is zero.</p>
<h1>DEBUGGING</h1>
<p>To aid in program development, there are two procps-ng provisions
that can be exploited.</p>
<p>The first is a supplied file named `libproc.supp' which may be useful
when developing a <em>multi-threaded</em> application. When used with
the valgrind `--suppressions=' option, warnings associated with the
procps library itself are avoided.</p>
<p>Such warnings arise because the library handles heap based
allocations in a thread-safe manner. A <em>single-threaded</em>
application will not receive those warnings.</p>
<p>The second provision can help ensure `result' member references agree
with library expectations. It assumes that a supplied macro in the
header file is used to access the `result' value.</p>
<p>This feature can be activated through either of the following methods
and any discrepancies will be written to <strong>stderr</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Add CFLAGS='-DXTRA_PROCPS_DEBUG' to any other ./configure options
your project may employ.</p></li>
<li><p>Add #include &lt;procps/xtra-procps-debug.h&gt; to any program
<em>after</em> the #include &lt;procps/pids.h&gt;.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This verification feature incurs substantial overhead. Therefore, it
is important that it <em>not</em> be activated for a production/release
build.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE(S)</h1>
<p>The value set for the following is unimportant, just its
presence.</p>
<dl>
<dt>LIBPROC_HIDE_KERNEL</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will hide kernel threads which would otherwise be returned with
a <strong>procps_pids_get</strong>, <strong>procps_pids_select</strong>
or <strong>procps_pids_reap</strong> call.</p>
</dd>
