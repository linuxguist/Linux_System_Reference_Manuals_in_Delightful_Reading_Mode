<p>HTML::Tree::Scanning -- article: "Scanning HTML"</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p># This an article, not a module.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The following article by Sean M. Burke first appeared in <em>The
Perl</em> Journal #19 and is copyright 2000 The Perl Journal. It appears
courtesy of Jon Orwant and The Perl Journal. This document may be
distributed under the same terms as Perl itself.</p>
<p>(Note that this is discussed in chapters 6 through 10 of the book

<h1>Scanning HTML</h1>
<p>-- Sean M. Burke</p>
<p>In <em>The Perl Journal</em> issue 17, Ken MacFarlane's article
Parsing HTML with HTML::Parser describes how the HTML::Parser module
scans HTML source as a stream of start-tags, end-tags, text, comments,
etc. In TPJ #18, my Trees article kicked around the idea of tree-shaped
data structures. Now I'll try to tie it together, in a discussion of
HTML trees.</p>
<p>The CPAN module HTML::TreeBuilder takes the tags that HTML::Parser
picks out, and builds a parse tree Ω- a tree-shaped network of
objects...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Footnote: And if you need a quick explanation of objects, see my
TPJ17 article A User's View of Object-Oriented Modules; or go whole hog
and get Damian Conway's excellent book <em>Object-Oriented Perl</em>,
from Manning Publications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...representing the structured content of the HTML document. And once
the document is parsed as a tree, you'll find the common tasks of
extracting data from that HTML document/tree to be quite
straightforward.</p>
<h2>HTML::Parser, HTML::TreeBuilder, and HTML::Element</h2>
<p>You use HTML::TreeBuilder to make a parse tree out of an HTML source
file, by simply saying:</p>
<p>use HTML::TreeBuilder; my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new();
$tree-&gt;parse_file(foo.html);</p>
<p>and then <code>$tree</code> contains a parse tree built from the HTML
source from the file foo.html. The way this parse tree is represented is
with a network of objects Ω- <code>$tree</code> is the root, an element
with tag-name html, and its children typically include a head and body
element, and so on. Elements in the tree are objects of the class
HTML::Element.</p>
<p>So, if you take this source:</p>
<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Doc 1&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt; Stuff &lt;hr&gt; 2000-08-17 &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>and feed it to HTML::TreeBuilder, it'll return a tree of objects that
looks like this:</p>
<p>html / \ head body / / | \ title "Stuff" hr "2000-08-17" | "Doc
1"</p>
<p>This is a pretty simple document, but if it were any more complex,
it'd be a bit hard to draw in that style, since it's sprawl left and
right. The same tree can be represented a bit more easily sideways, with
indenting:</p>
<p>. html . head . title . "Doc 1" . body . "Stuff" . hr .
"2000-08-17"</p>
<p>Either way expresses the same structure. In that structure, the root
node is an object of the class HTML::Element</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Footnote: Well actually, the root is of the class HTML::TreeBuilder,
but that's just a subclass of HTML::Element, plus the few extra methods
like <code>parse_file</code> that elaborate the tree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>, with the tag name html, and with two children: an HTML::Element
object whose tag names are head and body. And each of those elements
have children, and so on down. Not all elements (as we'll call the
objects of class HTML::Element) have children Ω- the hr element doesn't.
And note all nodes in the tree are elements Ω- the text nodes (Doc 1,
Stuff, and 2000-08-17) are just strings.</p>
<p>Objects of the class HTML::Element each have three noteworthy
attributes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>"_tag" Ω- (best accessed as "$e-&gt;tag") this element's tag-name,
lowercased (e.g., "em" for an "em" element).</dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Footnote: Yes, this is misnamed. In proper SGML terminology, this is
instead called a GI, short for generic identifier; and the term tag is
used for a token of SGML source that represents either the start of an
element (a start-tag like &lt;em lang='fr'&gt;) or the end of an element
(an end-tag like &lt;/em&gt;. However, since more people claim to have
been abducted by aliens than to have ever seen the SGML standard, and
since both encounters typically involve a feeling of missing time, it's
not surprising that the terminology of the SGML standard is not closely
followed.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>"_parent" Ω- (best accessed as "$e-&gt;parent") the element that is
$obj's parent, or undef if this element is the root of its tree.</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>"_content" Ω- (best accessed as "$e-&gt;content_list") the list of
nodes (i.e., elements or text segments) that are $e's children.</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Moreover, if an element object has any attributes in the SGML sense
of the word, then those are readable as <code>$e-&gt;attr(name)</code>
Ω- for example, with the object built from having parsed "&lt;a
<strong>id='foo'</strong>&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;",
<code>$e-&gt;attr(id)</code> will return the string foo. Moreover,
<code>$e-&gt;tag</code> on that object returns the string a,
<code>$e-&gt;content_list</code> returns a list consisting of just the
single scalar bar, and <code>$e-&gt;parent</code> returns the object
that's this node's parent Ω- which may be, for example, a p element.</p>
<p>And that's all that there is to it Ω- you throw HTML source at
TreeBuilder, and it returns a tree built of HTML::Element objects and
some text strings.</p>
<p>However, what do you <em>do</em> with a tree of objects? People code
information into HTML trees not for the fun of arranging elements, but
to represent the structure of specific text and images Ω- some text is
in this li element, some other text is in that heading, some images are
in that other table cell that has those attributes, and so on.</p>
<p>Now, it may happen that you're rendering that whole HTML tree into
some layout format. Or you could be trying to make some systematic
change to the HTML tree before dumping it out as HTML source again. But,
in my experience, by far the most common programming task that Perl
programmers face with HTML is in trying to extract some piece of
information from a larger document. Since that's so common (and also
since it involves concepts that are basic to more complex tasks), that
is what the rest of this article will be about.</p>
<h2>Scanning HTML trees</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a thousand HTML documents, each of them a press
release. They all start out:</p>
<p>[...lots of leading images and junk...] &lt;h1&gt;ConGlomCo to Open
New Corporate Office in Ougadougou&lt;/h1&gt; BAKERSFIELD, CA,
2000-04-24 -- ConGlomCos vice president in charge of world conquest,
Rock Feldspar, announced today the opening of a new office in
Ougadougou, the capital city of Burkino Faso, gateway to the bustling
"Silicon Sahara" of Africa... [...etc...]</p>
<p>...and what you've got to do is, for each document, copy whatever
text is in the h1 element, so that you can, for example, make a table of
contents of it. Now, there are three ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can just use a regexp to scan the file for a text pattern.
For many very simple tasks, this will do fine. Many HTML documents are,
in practice, very consistently formatted as far as placement of
linebreaks and whitespace, so you could just get away with scanning the
file like so: sub get_heading { my $filename = $_[0]; local *HTML;
open(HTML, $filename) or die "Couldnt open $filename); my $heading;
Line: while(&lt;HTML&gt;) { if( m{&lt;h1&gt;(.*?)&lt;/h1&gt;}i ) { #
match it! $heading = $1; last Line; } } close(HTML); warn "No heading in
$filename?" unless defined $heading; return $heading; } This is quick
and fast, but awfully fragile Ω- if there's a newline in the middle of a
heading's text, it won't match the above regexp, and you'll get an
error. The regexp will also fail if the h1 element's start-tag has any
attributes. If you have to adapt your code to fit more kinds of
start-tags, you'll end up basically reinventing part of HTML::Parser, at
which point you should probably just stop, and use HTML::Parser
itself:</p></li>
<li><p>You can use HTML::Parser to scan the file for an h1 start-tag
token, then capture all the text tokens until the h1 close-tag. This
approach is extensively covered in the Ken MacFarlane's TPJ17 article
Parsing HTML with HTML::Parser. (A variant of this approach is to use
HTML::TokeParser, which presents a different and rather handier
interface to the tokens that HTML::Parser picks out.) Using HTML::Parser
is less fragile than our first approach, since it's not sensitive to the
exact internal formatting of the start-tag (much less whether it's split
across two lines). However, when you need more information about the
context of the h1 element, or if you're having to deal with any of the
tricky bits of HTML, such as parsing of tables, you'll find out the flat
list of tokens that HTML::Parser returns isn't immediately useful. To
get something useful out of those tokens, you'll need to write code that
knows some things about what elements take no content (as with hr
elements), and that a &lt;/p&gt; end-tags are omissible, so a &lt;p&gt;
will end any currently open paragraph Ω- and you're well on your way to
pointlessly reinventing much of the code in HTML::TreeBuilder</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Footnote: And, as the person who last rewrote that module, I can
attest that it wasn't terribly easy to get right! Never underestimate
the perversity of people coding HTML.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>, at which point you should probably just stop, and use
HTML::TreeBuilder itself:</p></li>
<li><p>You can use HTML::Treebuilder, and scan the tree of element
objects that you get back.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last approach, using HTML::TreeBuilder, is the diametric opposite
of first approach: The first approach involves just elementary Perl and
one regexp, whereas the TreeBuilder approach involves being at home with
the concept of tree-shaped data structures and modules with
object-oriented interfaces, as well as with the particular interfaces
that HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element provide.</p>
<p>However, what the TreeBuilder approach has going for it is that it's
the most robust, because it involves dealing with HTML in its native
format Ω- it deals with the tree structure that HTML code represents,
without any consideration of how the source is coded and with what tags
omitted.</p>
<p>So, to extract the text from the h1 elements of an HTML document:</p>
<p>sub get_heading { my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new;
$tree-&gt;parse_file($_[0]); # ! my $heading; my $h1 =
$tree-&gt;look_down(_tag, h1); # ! if($h1) { $heading = $h1-&gt;as_text;
# ! } else { warn "No heading in $_[0]?"; } $tree-&gt;delete; # clear
memory! return $heading; }</p>
<p>This uses some unfamiliar methods that need explaining. The
<code>parse_file</code> method that we've seen before, builds a tree
based on source from the file given. The <code>delete</code> method is
for marking a tree's contents as available for garbage collection, when
you're done with the tree. The <code>as_text</code> method returns a
string that contains all the text bits that are children (or otherwise
descendants) of the given node Ω- to get the text content of the
<code>$h1</code> object, we could just say:</p>
<p>$heading = join , $h1-&gt;content_list;</p>
<p>but that will work only if we're sure that the h1 element's children
will be only text bits Ω- if the document contained:</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt;Local Man Sees &lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt;
Again&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p>then the sub-tree would be:</p>
<p>. h1 . "Local Man Sees " . cite . "Blade" . " Again</p>
<p>so <code>join , $h1-&gt;content_list</code> will be something
like:</p>
<p>Local Man Sees HTML::Element=HASH(0x15424040) Again</p>
<p>whereas <code>$h1-&gt;as_text</code> would yield:</p>
<p>Local Man Sees Blade Again</p>
<p>and depending on what you're doing with the heading text, you might
want the <code>as_HTML</code> method instead. It returns the (sub)tree
represented as HTML source. <code>$h1-&gt;as_HTML</code> would
yield:</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt;Local Man Sees &lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt;
Again&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p>However, if you wanted the contents of <code>$h1</code> as HTML, but
not the <code>$h1</code> itself, you could say:</p>
<p>join , map( ref($_) ? $_-&gt;as_HTML : $_, $h1-&gt;content_list )</p>
<p>This <code>map</code> iterates over the nodes in <code>$h1</code>'s
list of children; and for each node that's just a text bit (as Local Man
Sees is), it just passes through that string value, and for each node
that's an actual object (causing <code>ref</code> to be true),
<code>as_HTML</code> will used instead of the string value of the object
itself (which would be something quite useless, as most object values
are). So that <code>as_HTML</code> for the cite element will be the
string &lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt;. And then, finally,
<code>join</code> just puts into one string all the strings that the
<code>map</code> returns.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the most important method in our
<code>get_heading</code> sub is the <code>look_down</code> method. This
method looks down at the subtree starting at the given object
(<code>$h1</code>), looking for elements that meet criteria you
provide.</p>
<p>The criteria are specified in the method's argument list. Each
criterion can consist of two scalars, a key and a value, which express
that you want elements that have that attribute (like _tag, or src) with
the given value (h1); or the criterion can be a reference to a
subroutine that, when called on the given element, returns true if that
is a node you're looking for. If you specify several criteria, then
that's taken to mean that you want all the elements that each satisfy
<em>all</em> the criteria. (In other words, there's an implicit
AND.)</p>
<p>And finally, there's a bit of an optimization Ω- if you call the
<code>look_down</code> method in a scalar context, you get just the
<em>first</em> node (or undef if none) Ω- and, in fact, once
<code>look_down</code> finds that first matching element, it doesn't
bother looking any further.</p>
<p>So the example:</p>
<p>$h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down(_tag, h1);</p>
<p>returns the first element at-or-under <code>$tree</code> whose
<code>"_tag"</code> attribute has the value <code>"h1"</code>.</p>
<h2>Complex Criteria in Tree Scanning</h2>
<p>Now, the above <code>look_down</code> code looks like a lot of
bother, with barely more benefit than just grepping the file! But
consider if your criteria were more complicated Ω- suppose you found
that some of the press releases that you were scanning had several h1
elements, possibly before or after the one you actually want. For
example:</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt;Visit Our Corporate Partner &lt;br&gt;&lt;a
href="/dyna/clickthru" &gt;&lt;img src="/dyna/vend_ad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt;ConGlomCo President
Schreck to Visit Regional HQ &lt;br&gt;&lt;a
href="/photos/Schreck_visit_large.jpg" &gt;&lt;img
src="/photos/Schreck_visit.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p>Here, you want to ignore the first h1 element because it contains an
ad, and you want the text from the second h1. The problem is in
formalizing the way you know that it's an ad. Since ad banners are
always entreating you to visit the sponsoring site, you could exclude h1
elements that contain the word visit under them:</p>
<p>my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag, h1, sub { $_[0]-&gt;as_text
!~ m/\bvisit/i } );</p>
<p>The first criterion looks for h1 elements, and the second criterion
limits those to only the ones whose text content doesn't match
<code>m/\bvisit/</code>. But unfortunately, that won't work for our
example, since the second h1 mentions "ConGlomCo President Schreck to
<em>Visit</em> Regional HQ".</p>
<p>Instead you could try looking for the first h1 element that doesn't
contain an image:</p>
<p>my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag, h1, sub { not
$_[0]-&gt;look_down(_tag, img) } );</p>
<p>This criterion sub might seem a bit odd, since it calls
<code>look_down</code> as part of a larger <code>look_down</code>
operation, but that's fine. Note that when considered as a boolean
value, a <code>look_down</code> in a scalar context value returns false
(specifically, undef) if there's no matching element at or under the
given element; and it returns the first matching element (which, being a
reference and object, is always a true value), if any matches. So,
here,</p>
<p>sub { not $_[0]-&gt;look_down(_tag, img) }</p>
<p>means return true only if this element has no 'img' element as
descendants (and isn't an 'img' element itself).</p>
<p>This correctly filters out the first h1 that contains the ad, but it
also incorrectly filters out the second h1 that contains a
non-advertisement photo besides the headline text you want.</p>
<p>There clearly are detectable differences between the first and second
h1 elements Ω- the only second one contains the string Schreck, and we
could just test for that:</p>
<p>my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag, h1, sub { $_[0]-&gt;as_text
=~ m{Schreck} } );</p>
<p>And that works fine for this one example, but unless all thousand of
your press releases have Schreck in the headline, that's just not a
general solution. However, if all the ads-in-h1s that you want to
exclude involve a link whose URL involves /dyna/, then you can use
that:</p>
<p>my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag, h1, sub { my $link =
$_[0]-&gt;look_down(_tag,a); return 1 unless $link; # no link means its
fine return 0 if $link-&gt;attr(href) =~ m{/dyna/}; # a link to there is
bad return 1; # otherwise okay } );</p>
<p>Or you can look at it another way and say that you want the first h1
element that either contains no images, or else whose image has a src
attribute whose value contains /photos/:</p>
<p>my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag, h1, sub { my $img =
$_[0]-&gt;look_down(_tag,img); return 1 unless $img; # no image means
its fine return 1 if $img-&gt;attr(src) =~ m{/photos/}; # good if a
photo return 0; # otherwise bad } );</p>
<p>Recall that this use of <code>look_down</code> in a scalar context
means to return the first element at or under <code>$tree</code> that
matches all the criteria. But if you notice that you can formulate
criteria that'll match several possible h1 elements, some of which may
be bogus but the <em>last</em> one of which is always the one you want,
then you can use <code>look_down</code> in a list context, and just use
the last element of that list:</p>
<p>my @h1s = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag, h1, ...maybe more criteria... );
die "What, no h1s here?" unless @h1s; my $real_h1 = $h1s[-1]; # last or
only</p>
<h2>A Case Study: Scanning Yahoo News's HTML</h2>
<p>The above (somewhat contrived) case involves extracting data from a
bunch of pre-existing HTML files. In that sort of situation, if your
code works for all the files, then you know that the code <em>works</em>
Ω- since the data it's meant to handle won't go changing or growing;
and, typically, once you've used the program, you'll never need to use
it again.</p>
<p>The other kind of situation faced in many data extraction tasks is
where the program is used recurringly to handle new data Ω- such as from
ever-changing Web pages. As a real-world example of this, consider a
program that you could use (suppose it's crontabbed) to extract
headline-links from subsections of Yahoo News
(<code>http://dailynews.yahoo.com/</code>).</p>
<p>Yahoo News has several subsections:</p>
<dl>
<dt>http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/tc/ for technology news</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/sc/ for science news</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/hl/ for health news</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/wl/ for world news</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/en/ for entertainment news</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>and others. All of them are built on the same basic HTML template Ω-
and a scarily complicated template it is, especially when you look at it
with an eye toward making up rules that will select where the real
headline-links are, while screening out all the links to other parts of
Yahoo, other news services, etc. You will need to puzzle over the HTML
source, and scrutinize the output of <code>$tree-&gt;dump</code> on the
parse tree of that HTML.</p>
<p>Sometimes the only way to pin down what you're after is by position
in the tree. For example, headlines of interest may be in the third
column of the second row of the second table element in a page:</p>
<p>my $table = ( $tree-&gt;look_down(_tag,table) )[1]; my $row2 = (
$table-&gt;look_down(_tag, tr ) )[1]; my $col3 = (
$row2-&gt;look-down(_tag, td) )[2]; ...then do things with $col3...</p>
<p>Or they may be all the links in a p element that has at least three
br elements as children:</p>
<p>my $p = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag, p, sub { 2 &lt; grep { ref($_) and
$_-&gt;tag eq br } $_[0]-&gt;content_list } ); @links =
$p-&gt;look_down(_tag, a);</p>
<p>But almost always, you can get away with looking for properties of
the of the thing itself, rather than just looking for contexts. Now, if
you're lucky, the document you're looking through has clear semantic
tagging, such is as useful in CSS Ω- note the class=headlinelink bit
here:</p>
<p>&lt;a href="...long_news_url..." class="headlinelink"&gt;Elvis seen
in tortilla&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>If you find anything like that, you could leap right in and select
links with:</p>
<p>@links = $tree-&gt;look_down(class,headlinelink);</p>
<p>Regrettably, your chances of seeing any sort of semantic markup
principles really being followed with actual HTML are pretty thin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Footnote: In fact, your chances of finding a page that is simply free
of HTML errors are even thinner. And surprisingly, sites like Amazon or
Yahoo are typically worse as far as quality of code than personal sites
whose entire production cycle involves simply being saved and uploaded
from Netscape Composer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The code may be sort of accidentally semantic, however Ω- for
example, in a set of pages I was scanning recently, I found that looking
for td elements with a width attribute value of 375 got me exactly what
I wanted. No-one designing that page ever conceived of width=375 as
<em>meaning</em> this is a headline, but if you impute it to mean that,
it works.</p>
<p>An approach like this happens to work for the Yahoo News code,
because the headline-links are distinguished by the fact that they (and
they alone) contain a b element:</p>
<p>&lt;a href="...long_news_url..."&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elvis seen in
tortilla&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>or, diagrammed as a part of the parse tree:</p>
<p>. a [href="...long_news_url..."] . b . "Elvis seen in tortilla"</p>
<p>A rule that matches these can be formalized as look for any 'a'
element that has only one daughter node, which must be a 'b' element.
And this is what it looks like when cooked up as a
<code>look_down</code> expression and prefaced with a bit of code that
retrieves the text of the given Yahoo News page and feeds it to
TreeBuilder:</p>
<p>use strict; use HTML::TreeBuilder 2.97; use LWP::UserAgent; sub
get_headlines { my $url = $_[0] || die "What URL?"; my $response =
LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new-&gt;request( HTTP::Request-&gt;new( GET =&gt;
$url ) ); unless($response-&gt;is_success) { warn "Couldnt get $url: ",
$response-&gt;status_line, "\n"; return; } my $tree =
HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new(); $tree-&gt;parse($response-&gt;content);
$tree-&gt;eof; my @out; foreach my $link ( $tree-&gt;look_down( # !
_tag, a, sub { return unless $_[0]-&gt;attr(href); my @c =
$_[0]-&gt;content_list; @c == 1 and ref $c[0] and $c[0]-&gt;tag eq b; }
) ) { push @out, [ $link-&gt;attr(href), $link-&gt;as_text ]; } warn
"Odd, fewer than 6 stories in $url!" if @out &lt; 6; $tree-&gt;delete;
return @out; }</p>
<p>...and add a bit of code to actually call that routine and display
the results...</p>
<p>foreach my $section (qw[tc sc hl wl en]) { my @links = get_headlines(
"http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/$section/" ); print $section, ": ",
scalar(@links), " stories\n", map((" ", $_-&gt;[0], " : ", $_-&gt;[1],
"\n"), @links), "\n"; }</p>
<p>And we've got our own headline-extractor service! This in and of
itself isn't no amazingly useful (since if you want to see the
headlines, you <em>can</em> just look at the Yahoo News pages), but it
could easily be the basis for quite useful features like filtering the
headlines for matching certain keywords of interest to you.</p>
<p>Now, one of these days, Yahoo News will decide to change its HTML
template. When this happens, this will appear to the above program as
there being no links that meet the given criteria; or, less likely,
dozens of erroneous links will meet the criteria. In either case, the
criteria will have to be changed for the new template; they may just
need adjustment, or you may need to scrap them and start over.</p>
<h2><em>Regardez, duvet!</em></h2>
<p>It's often quite a challenge to write criteria to match the desired
parts of an HTML parse tree. Very often you <em>can</em> pull it off
with a simple <code>$tree-&gt;look_down(_tag, h1)</code>, but sometimes
you do have to keep adding and refining criteria, until you might end up
with complex filters like what I've shown in this article. The benefit
to learning how to deal with HTML parse trees is that one main search
tool, the <code>look_down</code> method, can do most of the work, making
simple things easy, while still making hard things possible.</p>
