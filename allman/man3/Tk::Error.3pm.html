<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Error - Method invoked to process background errors</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Customization:</p>
<p>require Tk::ErrorDialog;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>sub Tk::Error { my ($widget,$error,@locations) = @_; ... }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tk::Error</strong> method is invoked by perl/Tk when a
background error occurs. Two possible implementations are provided in
the distribution and individual applications or users can (re)define a
<strong>Tk::Error</strong> method (e.g. as a perl sub) if they wish to
handle background errors in some other manner.</p>
<p>A background error is one that occurs in a command that didn't
originate with the application. For example, if an error occurs while
executing a callback specified with a bind or a after command, then it
is a background error. For a non-background error, the error can simply
be returned up through nested subroutines until it reaches the top-level
code in the application; then the application can report the error in
whatever way it wishes. When a background error occurs, the unwinding
ends in the Tk library and there is no obvious way for Tk to report the
error.</p>
<p>When Tk detects a background error, it saves information about the
error and invokes the <strong>Tk::Error</strong> method later when Tk is
idle.</p>
<p><strong>Tk::Error</strong> is invoked by perl/Tk as if by the perl
code:</p>
<p>    <em><code>$mainwindow</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Tk::Error</strong>(<em>error
message</em>, <em>location ...</em>);</p>
<p><em><code>$mainwindow</code></em> is the <strong>MainWindow</strong>
associated with widget which detected the error, <em>error message</em>
is a string describing the error that has been detected,
<em>location</em> is a list of one or more locations which describe the
call sequence at the point the error was detected.</p>
<p>The locations are a typically a mixture of perl location reports
giving script name and line number, and simple strings describing
locations in core Tk or perl/Tk C code.</p>
<p>Tk will ignore any result returned by the <strong>Tk::Error</strong>
method. If another error occurs within the <strong>Tk::Error</strong>
method (for example if it calls <strong>die</strong>) then Tk reports
this error itself by writing a message to stderr (this is to avoid
infinite loops due to any bugs in <strong>Tk::Error</strong>).</p>
<p>If several background errors accumulate before
<strong>Tk::Error</strong> is invoked to process them,
<strong>Tk::Error</strong> will be invoked once for each error, in the
order they occurred. However, if <strong>Tk::Error</strong> calls
<strong>Tk-&gt;break</strong>, then any remaining errors are skipped
without calling <strong>Tk::Error</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tk</strong> module includes a default
<strong>Tk::Error</strong> subroutine that simply reports the error on
stderr.</p>
<h1>Tk::ErrorDialog</h1>
<p>An alternate definition is provided via:</p>
<p>    <code>require Tk::ErrorDialog;</code></p>
<p>that posts a dialog box containing the error message and offers the
user a chance to see a stack trace showing where the error occurred.</p>
<p>This is an OO implementation of the Tcl/Tk command
<strong>bgerror</strong>, with a twist: since there is only one
<strong>ErrorDialog</strong> widget, you aren't required to invoke the
constructor to create it; it will be created automatically when the
first background error occurs. However, in order to configure the
<em>-cleanupcode</em> and <em>-appendtraceback</em>
<strong>ErrorDialog</strong> options you must call the constructor and
create it manually.</p>
<p>The <strong>ErrorDialog</strong> object essentially consists of two
subwidgets: a <strong>Dialog</strong> widget to display the background
error and a <strong>Text</strong> widget for the traceback information.
If required, you can invoke various widget methods to customize these
subwidgets - their advertised names are described below.</p>
<p>    <em><code>$mw</code></em>-&gt;<strong>ErrorDialog</strong>(-cleanupcode
=&gt; <em>code</em>, -appendtraceback =&gt; <em>bool</em>);</p>
<p><code>$mw</code> is a window reference.</p>
<p><em>code</em> is a CODE reference if special post-background error
processing is required (default is undefined). The callback subroutine
is called with <code>@_</code> having the same arguments that
<strong>Tk::Error</strong> was invoked with.</p>
<p><em>bool</em> is a boolean indicating whether or not to append
successive tracebacks (default is 1, do append).</p>
<h2>Advertised ErrorDialog widgets</h2>
<p><em>error_dialog</em> is the Dialog widget reference.</p>
<p><em>text</em> is the Text widget reference containing the traceback
information.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>If <strong>after</strong> or <strong>fileevent</strong> are not
invoked as methods of a widget then perl/Tk is unable to provide a
<em><code>$mainwindow</code></em> argument. To support such code from
earlier versions of perl/Tk perl/Tk therefore calls
<strong>Tk::Error</strong> with string 'Tk' instead:
<strong>Tk-&gt;Tk::Error\(...\)</strong>. In this case the
<strong>Tk::Error</strong> in <strong>Tk::ErrorDialog</strong> and
similar implementations cannot popup a window as they don't know which
display to use. A mechanism to supply <em>the</em>
<strong>MainWindow</strong> in applications which only have one (a very
common case) should be provided.</p>
