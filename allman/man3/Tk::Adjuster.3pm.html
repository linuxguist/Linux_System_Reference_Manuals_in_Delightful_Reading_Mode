<p>Specifies a boolean value that determines whether the Adjuster should
forcibly attempt to make room for itself (by reducing the size of its
managed widget) when it is unmapped (for example, due to a size change

<p>Specifies the side on which the managed widget lies relative to the
Adjuster. In conjunction with the pack geometry manager, this relates to
the side of the master against which the managed widget and the Adjuster
are packed. Must be <strong>left</strong>, <strong>right</strong>,

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk::Adjuster</strong> is a Frame containing a line and a
blob.</p>
<p>Dragging with Mouse Button-1 results in a line being dragged to
indicate new size. Releasing Button-1 submits GeometryRequests on behalf
of the managed widget which will cause the packer to change the widget's
size.</p>
<p>If Drag is done with Shift button down, then GeometryRequests are
made in real time so that text-flow effects can be seen, but as a lot
more work is done behaviour may be sluggish.</p>
<p>If widget is packed with -side =&gt; left or -side =&gt; right then
width is adjusted. If packed -side =&gt; top or -side =&gt; bottom then
height is adjusted.</p>
<p><strong>packPropagate</strong> is turned off for the master window to
prevent adjustment changing overall window size. Similarly
<strong>packPropagate</strong> is turned off for the managed widget if
it has things packed inside it. This is so that the GeometryRequests
made by <strong>Tk::Adjuster</strong> are not overridden by pack.</p>
<p>In addition, the managed widget is made non-expandable to prevent the
geometry manager reallocating freed space in the master back to the
managed widget. Note however that expansion is turned off only after the
Adjuster is mapped, which allows the managed widget to expand naturally
on window creation.</p>
<p>The Tk::Widget method, <strong>packAdjust</strong>, calls pack on the
widget, then creates an instance of <strong>Tk::Adjuster</strong>, and
packs that after the widget. Its use has two disadvantages however: the
Adjuster widget is not made available to the caller, and options cannot
be set on the Adjuster. For these reasons, the Tk::Adjuster method,
<strong>packAfter</strong> is preferred, but <strong>packAdjust</strong>
is retained for backwards compatibility.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>$adjuster-&gt;packAfter(managed_widget, ?pack_options?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command configures the Adjuster's <strong>-widget</strong> and
<strong>-side</strong> options respectively to <em>managed_widget</em>
and the <strong>-side</strong> value specified in <em>pack_options</em>
(<strong>top</strong> if not specified). It then packs the Adjuster
after <em>managed_widget</em>, with <strong>-fill</strong> set to
<strong>x</strong> or <strong>y</strong> as appropriate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$adjuster-&gt;packForget?(boolean)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command calls <strong>Tk::Widget::packForget</strong> on the
Adjuster. If a parameter is provided and it has a true boolean value,
then <strong>packForget</strong> is also called on the managed
widget.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$adjuster-&gt;slave</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command returns the value
<em><code>$adjuster</code></em>-&gt;<em>cget('-widget')</em>, ie. the
reference to the managed widget.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>Using an Adjuster to separate two widgets, whereby the left
widget</strong> is managed, and right widget expands to fill space on a
window resize</p>
<p>a) Using packAfter (preferred interface)</p>
<p>use Tk; use Tk::Adjuster; my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new; my $lst1 =
$f-&gt;Listbox(); my $adj1 = $f-&gt;Adjuster(); my $lst2 =
$f-&gt;Listbox(); my $side = left; $lst1-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side,
-fill =&gt; both, -expand =&gt; 1); $adj1-&gt;packAfter($lst1, -side
=&gt; $side); $lst2-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; both,
-expand =&gt; 1); MainLoop;</p>
<p>b) Using packAdjust</p>
<p>use Tk; use Tk::Adjuster; my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new; my $lst1 =
$f-&gt;Listbox(); my $lst2 = $f-&gt;Listbox(); my $side = left;
$lst1-&gt;packAdjust(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; both);
$lst2-&gt;pack (-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; both, -expand =&gt; 1);
MainLoop;</p>
<p>c) Using the standard Tk::Widget::pack</p>
<p>use Tk; use Tk::Adjuster; my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new; my $side =
left; my $lst1 = $f-&gt;Listbox(); my $adj = $f-&gt;Adjuster(-widget
=&gt; $lst1, -side =&gt; $side); my $lst2 = $f-&gt;Listbox();
$lst1-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; both, -expand =&gt; 1);
$adj-&gt;pack (-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; y); $lst2-&gt;pack(-side
=&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; both, -expand =&gt; 1); MainLoop;</p>
<p>Changing the above examples so that <code>$side</code> has the value
'right' means the left widget expands to fill space on a window
resize.</p>
<p>Changing the above examples so that <code>$side</code> has the value
'top' produces a testcase with a horizontal Adjuster. Here the bottom
widget expands to fill space on a window resize. Packing to the 'bottom'
makes the top widget expand to fill space on window resize.</p>
<p><strong>Using -restore =&gt; 0 for multiple columns</strong></p>
<p>In the case of multiple columns (or rows) the restore functionality
of the Adjuster can be inconvenient. When the user adjusts the width of
one column and thereby pushes the Adjuster of another column off the
window, this adjuster tries to restore itself by reducing the size of
its managed widget. This has the effect that column widths shrink; and
the original size is not restored when the user reverses the originating
change. The <strong>-restore</strong> option can be used to turn off
this functionality. (It makes some sense, however, to leave
<strong>-restore</strong> turned on for the first-packed Adjuster, so
that at least one Adjuster always remains visible.)</p>
<p>use Tk; use Tk::Adjuster; my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new; my $lst1 =
$f-&gt;Listbox(); my $adj1 = $f-&gt;Adjuster(); my $lst2 =
$f-&gt;Listbox(); my $adj2 = $f-&gt;Adjuster(-restore =&gt; 0); my $lst3
= $f-&gt;Listbox(); my $side = left; $lst1-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side,
-fill =&gt; both, -expand =&gt; 1); $adj1-&gt;packAfter($lst1, -side
=&gt; $side); $lst2-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; both,
-expand =&gt; 1); $adj2-&gt;packAfter($lst2, -side =&gt; $side);
$lst3-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; both, -expand =&gt; 1);
MainLoop;</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>It is currently not possible to configure the appearance of the
Adjuster. It would be nice to be able to set the width and relief of the
Adjuster line and the presence/absence of the blob on the Adjuster.</p>
<p>Tk::Adjuster works theoretically with the grid geometry manager but
there are currently some problems which seem to be due to bugs in
grid:</p>
<p>a) Theres never an Unmap event for the adjuster, so the "restore"
functionality has no effect. b) After adjusting, widgets protrude into
the border of the master. c) grid(Propagate, 0) on MainWindow has no
effect - window shrinks/grows when widgets are adjusted. d) Widgets
shuffle to correct position on startup</p>
