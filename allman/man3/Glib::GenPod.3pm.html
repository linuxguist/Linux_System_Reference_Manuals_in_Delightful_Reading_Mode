<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::GenPod - POD generation utilities for Glib-based modules</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Glib::GenPod; # use the defaults: xsdoc2pod
($xsdocparse_output_file, $destination_dir); # or take matters into your
own hands require $xsdocparse_output_file; foreach my $package (sort
keys %$data) { print "=head1 NAME\n\n$package\n\n"; print "=head1
METHODS\n\n" . podify_methods ($package) . "\n\n"; }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module includes several utilities for creating pod for xs-based
Perl modules which build on the Glib module's foundations. The most
important bits are the logic to convert the data structures created by
xsdocparse.pl to describe xsubs and pods into method docs, with call
signatures and argument descriptions, and converting C type names into
Perl type names. The rest of the module is mostly boiler-plate code to
format and pretty-print information that may be queried from the Glib
type system.</p>
<p>To make life easy for module maintainers, we also include a do-it-all
function, <strong>xsdoc2pod()</strong>, which does pretty much
everything for you. All of the pieces it uses are publically usable, so
you can do whatever you like if you don't like the default output.</p>
<h1>DOCUMENTING THE XS FILES</h1>
<p>All of the information used as input to the methods included here
comes from the XS files of your project, and is extracted by
Glib::ParseXSDoc's <code>xsdocparse</code>. This function creates an
file containing Perl code that may be eval'd or require'd to recreate
the parsed data structures, which are a list of pods from the verbatim C
portion of the XS file (the xs api docs), and a hash of the remaining
data, keyed by package name, and including the pods and xsubs read from
the rest of each XS file following the first MODULE line.</p>
<p>Several custom POD directives are recognized in the XSubs section.
Note that each one is sought as a paragraph starter, and must follow a
<code>=cut</code> directive.</p>
<dl>
<dt>=for object Package::Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>All xsubs and pod from here until the next object directive or MODULE
line will be placed under the key '<em>Package::Name</em>' in
xsdocparse's data structure. Everything from this line to the next
<code>=cut</code> is included as a description POD.</p>
</dd>
<dt>=for object Package::Name (Other::Package::Name)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate POD in <em>Package::Name</em> but for the package
<em>Other::Package::Name</em>. This is useful if you want POD to appear
in a different namespace but still want the automatically generated
hierarchy, signal and property listing, etc. from the original
namespace. For example: =for object Gnome2::PanelApplet::main
(Gnome2::PanelApplet) =cut This will create Gnome2/PanelApplet/main.pod
containing the automatically generated documentation for
Gnome2::PanelApplet (hierarchy, signals, etc.) plus the method listing
from the current XS file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>=for enum Package::Name</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>=for flags Package::Name</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This causes xsdoc2pod to call <code>podify_values</code> on
<em>Package::Name</em> when writing the pod for the current package (as
set by an object directive or MODULE line). Any text in this paragraph,
to the next <code>=cut</code>, is included in that section.</p>
<dl>
<dt>=for deprecated_by Package::Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Used to add a deprecation warning, indicating <em>Package::Name</em>
as an alternative way to achieve the same functionality. There may be
any number these in each package.</p>
</dd>
<dt>=for see_also some_thing_to_see</dt>
<dd>
<p>Used to add extra see alsos onto the end of the parents, if any, for
a given object. Anything following the space behind see_also up to the
end of the line will be placed onto the list of see alsos. There may be
any number of these in each package.</p>
</dd>
<dt>=for apidoc</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>=for apidoc Full::Symbol::name</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Paragraphs of this type document xsubs, and are associated with the
xsubs by xsdocparse.pl. If the full symbol name is not included, the
paragraph must be attached to the xsub declaration (no blank lines
between <code>=cut</code> and the xsub). Within the apidoc PODs, we
recognize a few special directives (the for\s+ is optional on
these):</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>=for signature ...</dt>
<dd>
<p>Override the generated call signature with the ... text. If you
include multiple signature directives, they will all be used. This is
handy when you want to change the return type or list different ways to
invoke an overloaded method, like this: =for apidoc =signature bool
Class-&gt;foo =signature ($thing, @other) = $object-&gt;foo ($it,
$something) Text in here is included in the generated documentation. You
can actually include signature and arg directives at any point in this
pod -- they are stripped after. In fact, any pod is valid in here, until
the =cut. =cut void foo (...) PPCODE: /* crazy code follows */</p>
</dd>
<dt>=for arg name (type) description</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>=for arg name description</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The arg directive adds or overrides an argument description. The
description text is optional, as is the type specification (the part in
parentheses). If you want to hide an argument, specify
<code>_ _hide_ _</code> as its type. The arg name does <em>not</em> need
to include a sigil, as dollar signs will be added. FIXME what about @
for lists?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, we honor a couple of modifiers on the =for apidoc line,
following the symbol name, if present:</p>
<dl>
<dt>- _ _hide_ _</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not document this xsub. This is handy in certain situations, e.g.,
for private functions. DESTROY always has this turned on, for
example.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- _ _gerror_ _</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function or method can generate a Glib::Error exception.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- _ _function_ _</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate a function-style signature for this xsub. The default is to
generate method-style signatures.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- _ _deprecated_ _</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function or method is deprecated and should not be used in newly
written code.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(These are actually handled by Glib::ParseXSDoc, but we list them
here because, well, they're an important part of how you document the XS
files.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>xsdoc2pod ($datafile, $outdir='blib/lib', index=undef)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given a <em><code>$datafile</code></em> containing the output of
xsdocparse.pl, create in <em><code>$outdir</code></em> a pod file for
each package, containing everything we can think of for that module.
Output is controlled by the <code>=for object</code> directives and such
in the source code. If you don't want each package to create a separate
pod file, then use this function's code as a starting point for your own
pretty-printer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>add_types (@filenames)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Parse the given <em><code>@filenames</code></em> for entries to add
to the <code>%basic_types</code> used for C type name to Perl package
name mappings of types that are not registered with the Glib type
system. The file format is dead simple: blank lines are ignored; /#.*$/
is stripped from each line as comments; the first token on each line is
considered to be a C type name, and the remaining tokens are the
description of that type. For example, a valid file may look like this:
# a couple of special types FooBar Foo::Bar Frob localized frobnicator C
type decorations such as const and * are implied (do not include them),
and the _ornull variant is handled for you.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_properties ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pretty-print the object properties owned by the Glib::Object
derivative <em><code>$packagename</code></em> and return the text as a
string. Returns undef if there are no properties or
<em><code>$package</code></em> is not a Glib::Object.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_child_properties ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pretty-print the child properties owned by the Gtk2::Container
derivative <em><code>$packagename</code></em> and return the text as a
string. Returns undef if there are no child properties or
<em><code>$package</code></em> is not a Gtk2::Container or similar class
with a <code>list_child_properties()</code> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_style_properties ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pretty-print the style properties owned by the Gtk2::Widget
derivative <em><code>$packagename</code></em> and return the text as a
string. Returns undef if there are no style properties or
<em><code>$package</code></em> is not a Gtk2::Widget or similar class
with a <code>list_style_properties()</code> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_values ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>List and pretty-print the values of the GEnum or GFlags type
<em><code>$packagename</code></em>, and return the text as a string.
Returns undef if <em><code>$packagename</code></em> isn't an enum or
flags type.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_signals ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query, list, and pretty-print the signals associated with
<em><code>$packagename</code></em>. Returns the text as a string, or
undef if there are no signals or <em><code>$packagename</code></em> is
not a Glib::Object derivative.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_deprecated_by ($packagename, @deprecated_by)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a deprecation warning for <code>$packagename</code>,
suggesting using the items inside <code>@deprecated_by</code>
instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_pods ($pods, $position)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Helper function to allow specific placement of generic pod within the
auto generated pages. Pod sections starting out with =for position XXX,
where XXX is one of the following will be placed at a specified
position. In the case of pod that is to be placed after a particular
section that doesn't exist, that pod will be still be placed there. This
function is called at all of the specified points through out the
process of generating pod for a page. Any pod matching the
<em>position</em> passed will be returned, undef if no matches were
found. If <em>position</em> is undef all pods without specific position
information will be returned. <em>pods</em> is a reference to an array
of pod hashes.</p>

</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_ancestors ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pretty-prints the ancestry of <em><code>$packagename</code></em> from
the Glib type system's point of view. This uses
Glib::Type-&gt;list_ancestors; see that function's docs for an
explanation of why that's different from looking at <code>@ISA</code>.
Returns the new text as a string, or undef if
<em><code>$packagename</code></em> is not a registered GType.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_interfaces ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pretty-print the list of GInterfaces that
<em><code>$packagename</code></em> implements. Returns the text as a
string, or undef if the type implements no interfaces.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_methods ($packagename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Call <code>xsub_to_pod</code> on all the xsubs under the key
<em><code>$packagename</code></em> in the data extracted by
xsdocparse.pl. Returns the new text as a string, or undef if there are
no xsubs in <em><code>$packagename</code></em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = podify_see_alsos (@entries)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a list of links to be placed in the SEE ALSO section of the
page. Returns undef if nothing is in the input list.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = get_copyright</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a string that will/should be placed on each page. You can
control the text of this string by calling the class method
<em>set_copyright</em>. If no text has been set, we will attempt to
create one for you, using what has been passed to <em>set_year</em>,
<em>set_authors</em>, and <em>set_main_mod</em>. The year defaults to
the current year, the authors default to 'The Gtk2-Perl Team', and the
main mod is empty by default. You want the main mod to be set to the
main module of your extension for the SEE ALSO section, and on the
assumption that a decent license notice can be found in that module's
doc, we point the reader there. So, in general, you will want to specify
at least one of these, so that you don't credit your work to us under
the LGPL. To set them do something similar to the following in the first
part of your postamble section in Makefile.PL. All occurrences of
&lt;br&gt; in the copyright are replaced with newlines, to make it
easier to put in a multi-line string.
POD_SET=Glib::GenPod::set_copyright(qq{Copyright 1999
team-foobar&lt;br&gt;LGPL});
<strong>Glib::MakeHelper::postamble_docs_full()</strong> does this sort
of thing for you.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Helpers</h2>
<dl>
<dt>$perl_type = convert_type ($ctypestring)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Convert a C type name to a Perl type name. Uses
<code>%Glib::GenPod::basic_types</code> to look for some known basic
types, and uses Glib::Type-&gt;package_from_cname to look up the
registered package corresponding to a C type name. If no suitable
mapping can be found, this just returns the input string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = xsub_to_pod ($xsub, $sigprefix='')</dt>
<dd>
<p>Convert an xsub hash into a string of pod describing it. Includes the
call signature, argument listing, and description, honoring special
switches in the description pod (arg and signature overrides).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = compile_signature ($xsub)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given an xsub hash, return a string with the call signature for that
xsub.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = fixup_arg_name ($name)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Prepend a $ to anything that's not the literal ellipsis string
'...'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fixup_default</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mangle default parameter values from C to Perl values. Mostly, this
does NULL =&gt; undef.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>C type to Perl type conversion for argument types.</p>
</dd>
<dt>convert_return_type_to_name</dt>
