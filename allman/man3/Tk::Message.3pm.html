<h1>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Name: aspect</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Aspect</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -aspect</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating desired aspect
ratio for the text. The aspect ratio is specified as 100*width/height.
100 means the text should be as wide as it is tall, 200 means the text
should be twice as wide as it is tall, 50 means the text should be twice
as tall as it is wide, and so on. Used to choose line length for text if
<strong>width</strong> option isn't specified. Defaults to 150.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: justify</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Justify</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -justify</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies how to justify lines of text. Must be one of
<strong>left</strong>, <strong>center</strong>, or
<strong>right</strong>. Defaults to <strong>left</strong>. This option
works together with the <strong>anchor</strong>,
<strong>aspect</strong>, <strong>padX</strong>, <strong>padY</strong>,
and <strong>width</strong> options to provide a variety of arrangements
of the text within the window. The <strong>aspect</strong> and
<strong>width</strong> options determine the amount of screen space
needed to display the text. The <strong>anchor</strong>,
<strong>padX</strong>, and <strong>padY</strong> options determine where
this rectangular area is displayed within the widget's window, and the
<strong>justify</strong> option determines how each line is displayed
within that rectangular region. For example, suppose
<strong>anchor</strong> is <strong>e</strong> and
<strong>justify</strong> is <strong>left</strong>, and that the message
window is much larger than needed for the text. The the text will
displayed so that the left edges of all the lines line up and the right
edge of the longest line is <strong>padX</strong> from the right side of
the window; the entire text block will be centered in the vertical span
of the window.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies the length of lines in the window. The value may have any
of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>. If this option
has a value greater than zero then the <strong>aspect</strong> option is
ignored and the <strong>width</strong> option determines the line
length. If this option has a value less than or equal to zero, then the
<strong>aspect</strong> option determines the line length.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Message</strong> method creates a new window (given by
the <code>$widget</code> argument) and makes it into a message widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the message such
as its colors, font, text, and initial relief. The
<strong>message</strong> command returns its <code>$widget</code>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <code>$widget</code>, but <code>$widget</code>'s parent
must exist.</p>
<p>A message is a widget that displays a textual string. A message
widget has three special features. First, it breaks up its string into
lines in order to produce a given aspect ratio for the window. The line
breaks are chosen at word boundaries wherever possible (if not even a
single word would fit on a line, then the word will be split across
lines). Newline characters in the string will force line breaks; they
can be used, for example, to leave blank lines in the display.</p>
<p>The second feature of a message widget is justification. The text may
be displayed left-justified (each line starts at the left side of the
window), centered on a line-by-line basis, or right-justified (each line
ends at the right side of the window).</p>
<p>The third feature of a message widget is that it handles control
characters and non-printing characters specially. Tab characters are
replaced with enough blank space to line up on the next 8-character
boundary. Newlines cause line breaks. Other control characters (ASCII
code less than 0x20) and characters not defined in the font are
displayed as a four-character sequence <strong>\x</strong><em>hh</em>
where <em>hh</em> is the two-digit hexadecimal number corresponding to
the character. In the unusual case where the font doesn't contain all of
the characters in ``0123456789abcdef\x'' then control characters and
undefined characters are not displayed at all.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Message</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<h1>DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>When a new message is created, it has no default event bindings:
messages are intended for output purposes only.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Tabs don't work very well with text that is centered or
right-justified. The most common result is that the line is justified
wrong.</p>
