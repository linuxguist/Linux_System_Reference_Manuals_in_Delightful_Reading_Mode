<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>File::MimeInfo::Applications - Find programs to open a file by
mimetype</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use File::MimeInfo::Magic; use File::MimeInfo::Applications; my $file
= /foo/bar; my $mimetype = mimetype($file) || die "Could not find
mimetype for $file\n"; my ($default, @other) =
mime_applications($mimetype); if (defined $default) {
$default-&gt;system($file) } else { # prompt user with choice from
@others # ... }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module tries to find applications that can open files with a
certain mimetype. This is done in the way suggested by the freedesktop
Desktop Entry specification. This module is intended to be compatible
with file managers and other applications that implement this
specification.</p>
<p>This module depends on File::DesktopEntry being installed.</p>
<p>To use this module effectively you need to have the
desktop-file-utils package from freedesktop and run
update-desktop-database after installing new .desktop files. See
&lt;http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/desktop-file-utils&gt;.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing this module is compatible with the way
Nautilus (Gnome) and with Thunar (XFCE) handle applications for
mimetypes. I understand KDE is still working on implementing the
freedesktop mime specifications but will follow. At the very least all
perl applications using this module are using the same defaults.</p>
<h1>EXPORT</h1>
<p>All methods are exported by default.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>"mime_applications(MIMETYPE)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns an array of File::DesktopEntry objects. The first is the
default application for this mimetype, the rest are applications that
say they can handle this mimetype. If the first result is undefined
there is no default application and it is good practice to ask the user
which application he wants to use.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"mime_applications_all(MIMETYPE)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like <code>mime_applications()</code> but also takes into account
applications that can open mimetypes from which MIMETYPE inherits.
Parent mimetypes tell something about the data format, all code inherits
from text/plain for example.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"mime_applications_set_default(MIMETYPE, APPLICATION)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Save a default application for this mimetype. This action will affect
other applications using the same mechanism to find a default
application. APPLICATION can either be a File::DesktopEntry object or
the basename of a .desktop file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"mime_applications_set_custom(MIMETYPE, COMMAND)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Save a custom shell command as default application. Generates a
DesktopEntry file on the fly and calls
<code>mime_applications_set_custom</code>. Returns the DesktopEntry
object. No checks are done at all on COMMAND. It should however contain
at least one word.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>This module looks for associations files in the order specified in
version 1.0 of the MIME applications specification. It will also attempt
a last-resort fallback to the legacy file
<em><code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code>/applications/defaults.list</em>. In all
cases, it will only write to the recommended per-user defaults file
located at <em><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>/mimeapps.list</em>.</p>
