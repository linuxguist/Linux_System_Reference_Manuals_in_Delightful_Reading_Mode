<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tie::Watch - place watchpoints on Perl variables.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tie::Watch; $watch = Tie::Watch-&gt;new( -variable =&gt; \$frog,
-debug =&gt; 1, -shadow =&gt; 0, -fetch =&gt; [\&amp;fetch, arg1, arg2,
..., argn], -store =&gt; \&amp;store, -destroy =&gt; sub {print "Final
value=$frog.\n"}, } %vinfo = $watch-&gt;Info; $args =
$watch-&gt;Args(-fetch); $val = $watch-&gt;Fetch; print "val=",
$watch-&gt;Say($val), ".\n"; $watch-&gt;Store(Hello);
$watch-&gt;Unwatch;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This class module binds one or more subroutines of your devising to a
Perl variable. All variables can have <strong>FETCH</strong>,
<strong>STORE</strong> and <strong>DESTROY</strong> callbacks.
Additionally, arrays can define <strong>CLEAR</strong>,
<strong>DELETE</strong>, <strong>EXISTS</strong>,
<strong>EXTEND</strong>, <strong>FETCHSIZE</strong>,
<strong>POP</strong>, <strong>PUSH</strong>, <strong>SHIFT</strong>,
<strong>SPLICE</strong>, <strong>STORESIZE</strong> and
<strong>UNSHIFT</strong> callbacks, and hashes can define
<strong>CLEAR</strong>, <strong>DELETE</strong>,
<strong>EXISTS</strong>, <strong>FIRSTKEY</strong> and
<strong>NEXTKEY</strong> callbacks. If these term are unfamiliar to you,
I <em>really</em> suggest you read perltie.</p>
<p>With Tie::Watch you can:</p>
<p>. alter a variables value . prevent a variables value from being
changed . invoke a Perl/Tk callback when a variable changes . trace
references to a variable</p>
<p>Callback format is patterned after the Perl/Tk scheme: supply either
a code reference, or, supply an array reference and pass the callback
code reference in the first element of the array, followed by callback
arguments. (See examples in the Synopsis, above.)</p>
<p>Tie::Watch provides default callbacks for any that you fail to
specify. Other than negatively impacting performance, they perform the
standard action that you'd expect, so the variable behaves normally.
Once you override a default callback, perhaps to insert debug code like
print statements, your callback normally finishes by calling the
underlying (overridden) method. But you don't have to!</p>
<p>To map a tied method name to a default callback name simply lowercase
the tied method name and uppercase its first character. So FETCH becomes
Fetch, NEXTKEY becomes Nextkey, etcetera.</p>
<p>Here are two callbacks for a scalar. The <strong>FETCH</strong>
(read) callback does nothing other than illustrate the fact that it
returns the value to assign the variable. The <strong>STORE</strong>
(write) callback uppercases the variable and returns it. In all cases
the callback <em>must</em> return the correct read or write value -
typically, it does this by invoking the underlying method.</p>
<p>my $fetch_scalar = sub { my($self) = @_; $self-&gt;Fetch; }; my
$store_scalar = sub { my($self, $new_val) = @_; $self-&gt;Store(uc
$new_val); };</p>
<p>Here are <strong>FETCH</strong> and <strong>STORE</strong> callbacks
for either an array or hash. They do essentially the same thing as the
scalar callbacks, but provide a little more information.</p>
<p>my $fetch = sub { my($self, $key) = @_; my $val =
$self-&gt;Fetch($key); print "In fetch callback, key=$key, val=",
$self-&gt;Say($val); my $args = $self-&gt;Args(-fetch); print ",
args=(", join(", ", @$args), ")" if $args; print ".\n"; $val; }; my
$store = sub { my($self, $key, $new_val) = @_; my $val =
$self-&gt;Fetch($key); $new_val = uc $new_val; $self-&gt;Store($key,
$new_val); print "In store callback, key=$key, val=",
$self-&gt;Say($val), ", new_val=", $self-&gt;Say($new_val); my $args =
$self-&gt;Args(-store); print ", args=(", join(", ", @$args), ")" if
$args; print ".\n"; $new_val; };</p>
<p>In all cases, the first parameter is a reference to the Watch object,
used to invoke the following class methods.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>$watch = Tie::Watch-&gt;new(-options =&gt; values);</dt>
<dd>
<p>The watchpoint constructor method that accepts option/value pairs to
create and configure the Watch object. The only required option is
<strong>-variable</strong>. <strong>-variable</strong> is a
<em>reference</em> to a scalar, array or hash variable.
<strong>-debug</strong> (default 0) is 1 to activate debug print
statements internal to Tie::Watch. <strong>-shadow</strong> (default 1)
is 0 to disable array and hash shadowing. To prevent infinite recursion
Tie::Watch maintains parallel variables for arrays and hashes. When the
watchpoint is created the parallel shadow variable is initialized with
the watched variable's contents, and when the watchpoint is deleted the
shadow variable is copied to the original variable. Thus, changes made
during the watch process are not lost. Shadowing is on my default. If
you disable shadowing any changes made to an array or hash are lost when
the watchpoint is deleted. Specify any of the following relevant
callback parameters, in the format described above:
<strong>-fetch</strong>, <strong>-store</strong>,
<strong>-destroy</strong>. Additionally for arrays:
<strong>-clear</strong>, <strong>-extend</strong>,
<strong>-fetchsize</strong>, <strong>-pop</strong>,
<strong>-push</strong>, <strong>-shift</strong>,
<strong>-splice</strong>, <strong>-storesize</strong> and
<strong>-unshift</strong>. Additionally for hashes:
<strong>-clear</strong>, <strong>-delete</strong>,
<strong>-exists</strong>, <strong>-firstkey</strong> and
<strong>-nextkey</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$args = $watch-&gt;Args(-fetch);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a reference to a list of arguments for the specified
callback, or undefined if none.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$watch-&gt;Fetch(); $watch-&gt;Fetch($key);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a variable's current value. <code>$key</code> is required for
an array or hash.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%vinfo = $watch-&gt;Info();</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a hash detailing the internals of the Watch object, with
these keys: %vinfo = { -variable =&gt; SCALAR(0x200737f8) -debug =&gt; 0
-shadow =&gt; 1 -value =&gt; HELLO SCALAR -destroy =&gt;
ARRAY(0x200f86cc) -fetch =&gt; ARRAY(0x200f8558) -store =&gt;
ARRAY(0x200f85a0) -legible =&gt; above data formatted as a list of
string, for printing } For array and hash Watch objects, the
<strong>-value</strong> key is replaced with a <strong>-ptr</strong> key
which is a reference to the parallel array or hash. Additionally, for an
array or hash, there are key/value pairs for all the variable specific
callbacks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$watch-&gt;Say($val);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Used mainly for debugging, it returns <code>$val</code> in quotes if
required, or the string undefined for undefined values.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$watch-&gt;Store($new_val); $watch-&gt;Store($key, $new_val);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Store a variable's new value. <code>$key</code> is required for an
array or hash.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$watch-&gt;Unwatch();</dt>
<dd>
<p>Stop watching the variable.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EFFICIENCY CONSIDERATIONS</h1>
<p>If you can live using the class methods provided, please do so. You
can meddle with the object hash directly and improved watch performance,
at the risk of your code breaking in the future.</p>

<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>lusol@Lehigh.EDU, LUCC, 96/05/30 . Original version 0.92 release,
based on the Trace module from Hans Mulder, and ideas from Tim Bunce.
lusol@Lehigh.EDU, LUCC, 96/12/25 . Version 0.96, release two inner
references detected by Perl 5.004. lusol@Lehigh.EDU, LUCC, 97/01/11 .
Version 0.97, fix Makefile.PL and MANIFEST (thanks Andreas Koenig). Make
sure test.pl doesnt fail if Tk isnt installed.
Stephen.O.Lidie@Lehigh.EDU, Lehigh University Computing Center, 97/10/03
. Version 0.98, implement -shadow option for arrays and hashes.
Stephen.O.Lidie@Lehigh.EDU, Lehigh University Computing Center, 98/02/11
. Version 0.99, finally, with Perl 5.004_57, we can completely watch
arrays. With tied array support this module is essentially complete, so
its been optimized for speed at the expense of clarity - sorry about
that. The Delete() method has been renamed Unwatch() because it
conflicts with the builtin delete(). Stephen.O.Lidie@Lehigh.EDU, Lehigh
University Computing Center, 99/04/04 . Version 1.0, for Perl 5.005_03,
update Makefile.PL for ActiveState, and add two examples (one for
Perl/Tk). sol0@lehigh.edu, Lehigh University Computing Center,
2003/06/07 . Version 1.1, for Perl 5.8, can trace a reference now, patch
from Slaven Rezic. sol0@lehigh.edu, Lehigh University Computing Center,
2005/05/17 . Version 1.2, for Perl 5.8, per Rob Seegels suggestion,
support array DELETE and EXISTS.</p>
