<p>If this option is specified then it provides a callback to execute
each time the menu is posted. The callback is invoked by the
<strong>post</strong> method before posting the menu. Note that in 8.0
on Macintosh and Windows, all commands in a menu systems are executed
before any are posted. This is due to the limitations in the individual
platforms' menu managers.</p>

<p>This option must have a proper boolean value, which specifies whether
or not the menu should include a tear-off entry at the top. If so, it
will exist as entry 0 of the menu and the other entries will number
starting at 1. The default menu bindings arrange for the menu to be torn
off when the tear-off entry is invoked.</p>

<p>If this option has a non-empty value, then it specifies a perl/Tk
callback to invoke whenever the menu is torn off. The actual command
will consist of the value of this option, followed by a space, followed
by the name of the menu window, followed by a space, followed by the
name of the name of the torn off menu window. For example, if the
option's is ``<strong>a b</strong>'' and menu <strong>.x.y</strong> is
torn off to create a new menu <strong>.x.tearoff1</strong>, then the
command ``<strong>a b .x.y .x.tearoff1</strong>'' will be invoked.</p>

<p>This option can be one of <strong>menubar</strong>,
<strong>tearoff</strong>, or <strong>normal</strong>, and is set when
the menu is created. While the string returned by the configuration
database will change if this option is changed, this does not affect the
menu widget's behavior. This is used by the cloning mechanism and is not
normally set outside of the Tk library.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Menu</strong> method creates a new top-level window
(given by the <code>$widget</code> argument) and makes it into a menu
widget. Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the menu
such as its colors and font. The <strong>menu</strong> command returns
its <code>$widget</code> argument. At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named <code>$widget</code>, but
<code>$widget</code>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A menu is a widget that displays a collection of one-line entries
arranged in one or more columns. There exist several different types of
entries, each with different properties. Entries of different types may
be combined in a single menu. Menu entries are not the same as entry
widgets. In fact, menu entries are not even distinct widgets; the entire
menu is one widget.</p>
<p>Menu entries are displayed with up to three separate fields. The main
field is a label in the form of a text string, a bitmap, or an image,
controlled by the <strong>-label</strong>, <strong>-bitmap</strong>, and
<strong>-image</strong> options for the entry. If the
<strong>-accelerator</strong> option is specified for an entry then a
second textual field is displayed to the right of the label. The
accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be typed
in the application to cause the same result as invoking the menu entry.
The third field is an <em>indicator</em>. The indicator is present only
for checkbutton or radiobutton entries. It indicates whether the entry
is selected or not, and is displayed to the left of the entry's
string.</p>
<p>In normal use, an entry becomes active (displays itself differently)
whenever the mouse pointer is over the entry. If a mouse button is
released over the entry then the entry is <em>invoked</em>. The effect
of invocation is different for each type of entry; these effects are
described below in the sections on individual entries.</p>
<p>Entries may be <em>disabled</em>, which causes their labels and
accelerators to be displayed with dimmer colors. The default menu
bindings will not allow a disabled entry to be activated or invoked.
Disabled entries may be re-enabled, at which point it becomes possible
to activate and invoke them again.</p>
<p>Whenever a menu's active entry is changed, a
&lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; virtual event is sent to the menu. The active
item can then be queried from the menu, and an action can be taken, such
as setting context-sensitive help text for the entry.</p>
<h2>COMMAND ENTRIES</h2>
<p>The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which behaves
much like a button widget. When a command entry is invoked, a callback
is executed. The callback is specified with the
<strong>-command</strong> option.</p>
<h2>SEPARATOR ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A separator is an entry that is displayed as a horizontal dividing
line. A separator may not be activated or invoked, and it has no
behavior other than its display appearance.</p>
<h2>CHECKBUTTON ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton widget. When
it is invoked it toggles back and forth between the selected and
deselected states. When the entry is selected, a particular value is
stored in a particular global variable (as determined by the
<strong>-onvalue</strong> and <strong>-variable</strong> options for the
entry); when the entry is deselected another value (determined by the
<strong>-offvalue</strong> option) is stored in the global variable. An
indicator box is displayed to the left of the label in a checkbutton
entry. If the entry is selected then the indicator's center is displayed
in the color given by the <strong>-selectcolor</strong> option for the
entry; otherwise the indicator's center is displayed in the background
color for the menu. If a <strong>-command</strong> option is specified
for a checkbutton entry, then its value is evaluated each time the entry
is invoked; this happens after toggling the entry's selected state.</p>
<h2>RADIOBUTTON ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A radiobutton menu entry behaves much like a radiobutton widget.
Radiobutton entries are organized in groups of which only one entry may
be selected at a time. Whenever a particular entry becomes selected it
stores a particular value into a particular global variable (as
determined by the <strong>-value</strong> and <strong>-variable</strong>
options for the entry). This action causes any previously-selected entry
in the same group to deselect itself. Once an entry has become selected,
any change to the entry's associated variable will cause the entry to
deselect itself. Grouping of radiobutton entries is determined by their
associated variables: if two entries have the same associated variable
then they are in the same group. An indicator diamond is displayed to
the left of the label in each radiobutton entry. If the entry is
selected then the indicator's center is displayed in the color given by
the <strong>-selectcolor</strong> option for the entry; otherwise the
indicator's center is displayed in the background color for the menu. If
a <strong>-command</strong> option is specified for a radiobutton entry,
then its value is evaluated each time the entry is invoked; this happens
after selecting the entry.</p>
<h2>CASCADE ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A cascade entry is one with an associated menu (determined by the
<strong>-menu</strong> option). Cascade entries allow the construction
of cascading menus. The <strong>postcascade</strong> method can be used
to post and unpost the associated menu just next to of the cascade
entry. The associated menu must be a child of the menu containing the
cascade entry (this is needed in order for menu traversal to work
correctly).</p>
<p>A cascade entry posts its associated menu by invoking</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><code>$menu</code></em>-&gt;<strong>post</strong>(<em>x,y</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>menu</em> is the path name of the associated menu, and
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are the root-window coordinates of the
upper-right corner of the cascade entry. On Unix, the lower-level menu
is unposted by executing</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><code>$menu</code></em>-&gt;<strong>unpost</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>menu</em> is the name of the associated menu. On other
platforms, the platform's native code takes care of unposting the
menu.</p>
<p>If a <strong>-command</strong> option is specified for a cascade
entry then it is evaluated whenever the entry is invoked. This is not
supported on Windows.</p>
<h2>TEAR-OFF ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A tear-off entry appears at the top of the menu if enabled with the
<strong>tearOff</strong> option. It is not like other menu entries in
that it cannot be created with the <strong>add</strong> method and
cannot be deleted with the <strong>delete</strong> method. When a
tear-off entry is created it appears as a dashed line at the top of the
menu. Under the default bindings, invoking the tear-off entry causes a
torn-off copy to be made of the menu and all of its submenus.</p>
<h2>MENUBARS</h2>
<p>Any menu can be set as a menubar for a toplevel window (see the
Toplevel constructor for syntax). On the Macintosh, whenever the
toplevel is in front, this menu's cascade items will appear in the
menubar across the top of the main monitor. On Windows and Unix, this
menu's items will be displayed in a menubar accross the top of the
window. These menus will behave according to the interface guidelines of
their platforms. For every menu set as a menubar, a clone menu is made.
See CLONES for more information.</p>
<p>As noted, menubars may behave differently on different platforms. One
example of this concerns the handling of checkbuttons and radiobuttons
within the menu. While it is permitted to put these menu elements on
menubars, they may not be drawn with indicators on some platforms, due
to system restrictions.</p>
<h2>SPECIAL MENUS IN MENUBARS</h2>
<p>Certain menus in a menubar will be treated specially. On the
Macintosh, access to the special Apple and Help menus is provided. On
Windows, access to the Windows System menu in each window is provided.
On X Windows, a special right-justified help menu is provided. In all
cases, these menus must be created with the command name of the menubar
menu concatenated with the special name. So for a menubar named
.menubar, on the Macintosh, the special menus would be .menubar.apple
and .menubar.help; on Windows, the special menu would be
.menubar.system; on X Windows, the help menu would be .menubar.help.</p>
<p>When Tk sees an Apple menu on the Macintosh, that menu's contents
make up the first items of the Apple menu on the screen whenever the
window containing the menubar is in front. The menu is the first one
that the user sees and has a title which is an Apple logo. After all of
the Tk-defined items, the menu will have a separator, followed by all of
the items in the user's Apple Menu Items folder. Since the System uses a
different menu definition procedure for the Apple menu than Tk uses for
its menus, and the system APIs do not fully support everything Tk tries
to do, the menu item will only have its text displayed. No font
attributes, images, bitmaps, or colors will be displayed. In addition, a
menu with a tearoff item will have the tearoff item displayed as
(TearOff).</p>
<p>When Tk see a Help menu on the Macintosh, the menu's contents are
appended to the standard help menu on the right of the user's menubar
whenever the user's menubar is in front. The first items in the menu are
provided by Apple. Similar to the Apple Menu, cusomization in this menu
is limited to what the system provides.</p>
<p>When Tk sees a System menu on Windows, its items are appended to the
system menu that the menubar is attached to. This menu has an icon
representing a spacebar, and can be invoked with the mouse or by typing
Alt+Spacebar. Due to limitations in the Windows API, any font changes,
colors, images, bitmaps, or tearoff images will not appear in the system
menu.</p>
<p>When Tk see a Help menu on X Windows, the menu is moved to be last in
the menubar and is right justified.</p>
<h2>CLONES</h2>
<p>When a menu is set as a menubar for a toplevel window, or when a menu
is torn off, a clone of the menu is made. This clone is a menu widget in
its own right, but it is a child of the original. Changes in the
configuration of the original are reflected in the clone. Additionally,
any cascades that are pointed to are also cloned so that menu traversal
will work right. Clones are destroyed when either the tearoff or menubar
goes away, or when the original menu is destroyed.</p>
<h2>WIDGET METHODS</h2>
<p>The <strong>Menu</strong> method creates a widget object. This object
supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class, and the Tk::Wm class.</p>
<p>Many of the methods for a menu take as one argument an indicator of
which entry of the menu to operate on. These indicators are called
<em>index</em>es and may be specified in any of the following forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the top-most
entry of the menu, 1 to the entry below it, and so on.</p>
</dd>
<dt>active</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the entry that is currently active. If no entry is active
then this form is equivalent to <strong>none</strong>. This form may not
be abbreviated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>end</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu. If there are no entries
in the menu then this form is equivalent to <strong>none</strong>. This
form may not be abbreviated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>last</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as <strong>end</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates ``no entry at all''; this is used most commonly with the
<strong>activate</strong> option to deactivate all the entries in the
menu. In most cases the specification of <strong>none</strong> causes
nothing to happen in the method. This form may not be abbreviated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li><p>In this form, <em>number</em> is treated as a y-coordinate in the
menu's window; the entry closest to that y-coordinate is used. For
example, ``<strong><code>@0</code></strong>'' indicates the top-most
entry in the window.</p></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>pattern</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this form is
used. <em>Pattern</em> is pattern-matched against the label of each
entry in the menu, in order from the top down, until a matching entry is
found. (In perl/Tk the matching is under review, but exact match should
work.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following methods are possible for menu widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$menu-&gt;activate(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Change the state of the entry indicated by <em>index</em> to
<strong>active</strong> and redisplay it using its active colors. Any
previously-active entry is deactivated. If <em>index</em> is specified
as <strong>none</strong>, or if the specified entry is disabled, then
the menu ends up with no active entry. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;add(type, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add a new entry to the bottom of the menu. The new entry's type is
given by <em>type</em> and must be one of <strong>cascade</strong>,
<strong>checkbutton</strong>, <strong>command</strong>,
<strong>radiobutton</strong>, or <strong>separator</strong>, or a unique
abbreviation of one of the above. If additional arguments are present,
they specify any of the following options:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-activebackground =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when it
is active. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),
then the <strong>activeBackground</strong> option for the overall menu
is used. If the <strong><code>$Tk::strictMotif</code></strong> variable
has been set to request strict Motif compliance, then this option is
ignored and the <strong>-background</strong> option is used in its
place. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-activeforeground =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it
is active. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),
then the <strong>activeForeground</strong> option for the overall menu
is used. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-accelerator =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a string to display at the right side of the menu entry.
Normally describes an accelerator keystroke sequence that may be typed
to invoke the same function as the menu entry. This option is not
available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-background =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when it
is in the normal state (neither active nor disabled). If this option is
specified as an empty string (the default), then the
<strong>background</strong> option for the overall menu is used. This
option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-bitmap =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu instead of a textual label,
in any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. This
option overrides the <strong>-label</strong> option but may be reset to
an empty string to enable a textual label to be displayed. If a
<strong>-image</strong> option has been specified, it overrides
<strong>-bitmap</strong>. This option is not available for separator or
tear-off entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-columnbreak =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>When this option is zero, the appears below the previous entry. When
this option is one, the menu appears at the top of a new column in the
menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-compound =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether the button should display both an image and text,
and if so, where the image should be placed relative to the text. Valid
values for this option are <strong>bottom</strong>,
<strong>center</strong>, <strong>left</strong>, <strong>none</strong>,
<strong>right</strong> and <strong>top</strong>. The default value is
<strong>none</strong>, meaning that the button will display either an
image or text, depending on the values of the -image and -bitmap
options.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-command =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>For command, checkbutton, and radiobutton entries, specifies a
callback to execute when the menu entry is invoked. For cascade entries,
specifies a callback to execute when the entry is activated (i.e. just
before its submenu is posted). Not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-font =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the font to use when drawing the label or accelerator
string in this entry. If this option is specified as an empty string
(the default) then the <strong>font</strong> option for the overall menu
is used. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-foreground =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it
is in the normal state (neither active nor disabled). If this option is
specified as an empty string (the default), then the
<strong>foreground</strong> option for the overall menu is used. This
option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-hidemargin =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether the standard margins should be drawn for this menu
entry. This is useful when creating palette with images in them, i.e.,
color palettes, pattern palettes, etc. 1 indicates that the margin for
the entry is hidden; 0 means that the margin is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-image =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies an image to display in the menu instead of a text string or
bitmap The image must have been created by some previous invocation of
<strong>image create</strong>. This option overrides the
<strong>-label</strong> and <strong>-bitmap</strong> options but may be
reset to an empty string to enable a textual or bitmap label to be
displayed. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-indicatoron =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.
<em>Value</em> is a boolean that determines whether or not the indicator
should be displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-label =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a string to display as an identifying label in the menu
entry. Not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-menu =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for cascade entries. Specifies the path name of the
submenu associated with this entry. The submenu must be a child of the
menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-offvalue =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for checkbutton entries. Specifies the value to store
in the entry's associated variable when the entry is deselected.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-onvalue =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for checkbutton entries. Specifies the value to store
in the entry's associated variable when the entry is selected.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-selectcolor =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies the
color to display in the indicator when the entry is selected. If the
value is an empty string (the default) then the
<strong>selectColor</strong> option for the menu determines the
indicator color.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-selectimage =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies an
image to display in the entry (in place of the <strong>-image</strong>
option) when it is selected. <em>Value</em> is the name of an image,
which must have been created by some previous invocation of
<strong>image create</strong>. This option is ignored unless the
<strong>-image</strong> option has been specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-state =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the entry: <strong>normal</strong>,
<strong>active</strong>, or <strong>disabled</strong>. In normal state
the entry is displayed using the <strong>foreground</strong> option for
the menu and the <strong>background</strong> option from the entry or
the menu. The active state is typically used when the pointer is over
the entry. In active state the entry is displayed using the
<strong>activeForeground</strong> option for the menu along with the
<strong>activebackground</strong> option from the entry. Disabled state
means that the entry should be insensitive: the default bindings will
refuse to activate or invoke the entry. In this state the entry is
displayed according to the <strong>disabledForeground</strong> option
for the menu and the <strong>background</strong> option from the entry.
This option is not available for separator entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-underline =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the entry.
This option is also queried by the default bindings and used to
implement keyboard traversal. 0 corresponds to the first character of
the text displayed in the entry, 1 to the next character, and so on. If
a bitmap or image is displayed in the entry then this option is ignored.
This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-value =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for radiobutton entries. Specifies the value to store
in the entry's associated variable when the entry is selected. If an
empty string is specified, then the <strong>-label</strong> option for
the entry as the value to store in the variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-variable =&gt; value</dt>
<dd>
<p>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies the
name of a global value to set when the entry is selected. For
checkbutton entries the variable is also set when the entry is
deselected. For radiobutton entries, changing the variable causes the
currently-selected entry to deselect itself.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>add</strong> method returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;clone($parent ?, cloneType?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes a clone of the current menu as a child of
<em><code>$parent</code></em>. This clone is a menu in its own right,
but any changes to the clone are propogated to the original menu and
vice versa. <em>cloneType</em> can be <strong>normal</strong>,
<strong>menubar</strong>, or <strong>tearoff</strong>. Should not
normally be called outside of the Tk library. See CLONES for more
information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;delete(index1?, index2?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delete all of the menu entries between <em>index1</em> and
<em>index2</em> inclusive. If <em>index2</em> is omitted then it
defaults to <em>index1</em>. Attempts to delete a tear-off menu entry
are ignored (instead, you should change the <strong>tearOff</strong>
option to remove the tear-off entry).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;entrycget(index, option)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of a configuration option for the entry
given by <em>index</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values
accepted by the <strong>add</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;entryconfigure(index ?,options?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is similar to the <strong>configure</strong> method,
except that it applies to the options for an individual entry, whereas
<strong>configure</strong> applies to the options for the menu as a
whole. <em>Options</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
<strong>add</strong> method. If <em>options</em> are specified, options
are modified as indicated in the method call and the method returns an
empty string. If no <em>options</em> are specified, returns a list
describing the current options for entry <em>index</em> (see Tk::options
for information on the format of this list).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;index(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the numerical index corresponding to <em>index</em>, or
<strong>none</strong> if <em>index</em> was specified as
<strong>none</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;insert(index, type?, -option=&gt;value, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as the <strong>add</strong> method except that it inserts the
new entry just before the entry given by <em>index</em>, instead of
appending to the end of the menu. The <em>type</em>, <em>-option</em>,
and <em>value</em> arguments have the same interpretation as for the
<strong>add</strong> widget method. It is not possible to insert new
menu entries before the tear-off entry, if the menu has one.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;invoke(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke the action of the menu entry. See the sections on the
individual entries above for details on what happens. If the menu entry
is disabled then nothing happens. If the entry has a callback associated
with it then the result of that callback is returned as the result of
the <strong>invoke</strong> widget method. Otherwise the result is an
empty string. Note: invoking a menu entry does not automatically unpost
the menu; the default bindings normally take care of this before
invoking the <strong>invoke</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;post(x, y)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for the menu to be displayed on the screen at the root-window
coordinates given by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. These coordinates are
adjusted if necessary to guarantee that the entire menu is visible on
the screen. This method normally returns an empty string. If the
<strong>postCommand</strong> option has been specified, then its value
is executed before posting the menu and the result of that callback is
returned as the result of the <strong>post</strong> widget method. If an
error returns while executing the method, then the error is returned
without posting the menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;postcascade(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Posts the submenu associated with the cascade entry given by
<em>index</em>, and unposts any previously posted submenu. If
<em>index</em> doesn't correspond to a cascade entry, or if
<em><code>$menu</code></em> isn't posted, the method has no effect
except to unpost any currently posted submenu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;type(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the type of the menu entry given by <em>index</em>. This is
the <em>type</em> argument passed to the <strong>add</strong> widget
method when the entry was created, such as <strong>command</strong> or
<strong>separator</strong>, or <strong>tearoff</strong> for a tear-off
entry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;unpost</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unmap the window so that it is no longer displayed. If a lower-level
cascaded menu is posted, unpost that menu. Returns an empty string. This
method does not work on Windows and the Macintosh, as those platforms
have their own way of unposting menus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$menu-&gt;yposition(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate within the menu
window of the topmost pixel in the entry specified by
<em>index</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>MENU CONFIGURATIONS</h1>
<p>The default bindings support four different ways of using menus:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Pulldown Menus in Menubar</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the most command case. You create a menu widget that will
become the menu bar. You then add cascade entries to this menu,
specifying the pull down menus you wish to use in your menu bar. You
then create all of the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify the
menu using the <strong>-menu</strong> option of the toplevel's method.
See the <strong>toplevel</strong> manual entry for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pulldown Menus in Menu Buttons</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the compatible way to do menu bars. You create one menubutton
widget for each top-level menu, and typically you arrange a series of
menubuttons in a row in a menubar window. You also create the top-level
menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie them together with
<strong>-menu</strong> options in menubuttons and cascade menu entries.
The top-level menu must be a child of the menubutton, and each submenu
must be a child of the menu that refers to it. Once you have done this,
the default bindings will allow users to traverse and invoke the tree of
menus via its menubutton; see the <strong>menubutton</strong>
documentation for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Popup Menus</dt>
<dd>
<p>Popup menus typically post in response to a mouse button press or
keystroke. You create the popup menus and any cascaded submenus, then
you call the <strong>Post</strong> method at the appropriate time to
post the top-level menu.
<em><code>$menu</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Post</strong>(<em><code>$x</code></em>,<em><code>$y</code></em>?,<em><code>$entry</code></em>?)
<em><code>$x</code></em> and <em><code>$y</code></em> are the root
window coordinates at which the <em><code>$menu</code></em> will be
displayed. If <em><code>$entry</code></em> is specified then that entry
is centred on that point, otherwise the top-left corner of the
<em><code>$menu</code></em> is placed at that point.
<strong>Menu</strong> also inherits methods from Tk::Wm and so the
method <strong>Popup</strong> can be used to position menu relative to
other windows, the mouse cursor or the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Option Menus</dt>
<dd>
<p>An option menu consists of a menubutton with an associated menu that
allows you to select one of several values. The current value is
displayed in the menubutton and is also stored in a global variable. Use
the Tk::Optionmenu class to create option menubuttons and their
menus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Torn-off Menus</dt>
<dd>
<p>You create a torn-off menu by invoking the tear-off entry at the top
of an existing menu. The default bindings will create a new menu that is
a copy of the original menu and leave it permanently posted as a
top-level window. The torn-off menu behaves just the same as the
original menu.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for menus that give them the
following default behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When the mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath the mouse cursor
activates; as the mouse moves around the menu, the active entry changes
to track the mouse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When the mouse leaves a menu all of the entries in the menu
deactivate, except in the special case where the mouse moves from a menu
to a cascaded submenu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When a button is released over a menu, the active entry (if any) is
invoked. The menu also unposts unless it is a torn-off menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry and unpost the
menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If any of the entries in a menu have letters underlined with with
<strong>-underline</strong> option, then pressing one of the underlined
letters (or its upper-case or lower-case equivalent) invokes that entry
and unposts the menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Escape key aborts a menu selection in progress without invoking
any entry. It also unposts the menu unless it is a torn-off menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Up and Down keys activate the next higher or lower entry in the
menu. When one end of the menu is reached, the active entry wraps around
to the other end.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[8]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Left key moves to the next menu to the left. If the current menu
is a cascaded submenu, then the submenu is unposted and the current menu
entry becomes the cascade entry in the parent. If the current menu is a
top-level menu posted from a menubutton, then the current menubutton is
unposted and the next menubutton to the left is posted. Otherwise the
key has no effect. The left-right order of menubuttons is determined by
their stacking order: Tk assumes that the lowest menubutton (which by
default is the first one created) is on the left.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[9]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Right key moves to the next menu to the right. If the current
entry is a cascade entry, then the submenu is posted and the current
menu entry becomes the first entry in the submenu. Otherwise, if the
current menu was posted from a menubutton, then the current menubutton
is unposted and the next menubutton to the right is posted. Disabled
menu entries are non-responsive: they don't activate and they ignore
mouse button presses and releases. The behavior of menus can be changed
by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the
class bindings.</p>
