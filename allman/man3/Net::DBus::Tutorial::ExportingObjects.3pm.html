<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Net::DBus::Tutorial::ExportingObjects - tutorials on providing a DBus
service</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This document provides a tutorial on providing a DBus service using
the Perl Net::DBus application bindings. This examples in this document
will be based on the code from the Music::Player distribution, which is
a simple DBus service providing a music track player.</p>
<h1>CREATING AN OBJECT</h1>
<p>The first step in creating an object is to create a new package which
inherits from Net::DBus::Object. The Music::Player::Manager object
provides an API for managing the collection of music player backends for
different track types. To start with, lets create the skeleton of the
package &amp; its constructor. The constructor of the super type,
Net::DBus::Object expects to be given to parameters, a handle to the
Net::DBus::Service owning the object, and a path under which the object
shall be exported. Since the manager class is intended to be a singleton
object, we can hard code the path to it within the constructor:</p>
<p>package Music::Player::Manager; use base qw(Net::DBus::Object); sub
new { my $class = shift; my $service = shift; my $self =
$class-&gt;SUPER::new($service, "/music/player/manager"); bless $self,
$class; return $self; } 1;</p>
<p>Now, as mentioned, the manager with handle a number of different
player backends. So we need to provide methods for registering new
backends, and querying for backends capable of playing a particular file
type. So modifying the above code we add a hash table in the
constructor, to store the backends:</p>
<p>sub new { my $class = shift; my $service = shift; my $self =
$class-&gt;SUPER::new($service, "/music/player/manager");
$self-&gt;{backends} = {}; bless $self, $class; return $self; }</p>
<p>And now a method to register a new backend. This takes a Perl module
name and uses it to instantiate a backend. Since the backends are also
going to be DBus objects, we need to pass in a reference to the service
we are attached to, along with a path under which to register the
backend. We use the <code>get_service</code> method to retreieve a
reference to the service the manager is attached to, and attach the
player backend to this same service: When a method on DBus object is
invoked, the first parameter is the object reference
(<code>$self</code>), and the remainder are the parameters provided to
the method call. Thus writing a method implementation on a DBUs is
really no different to normal object oriented Perl (cf perltoot):</p>
<p>sub register_backend { my $self = shift; my $name = shift; my $module
= shift; eval "use $module"; if ($@) { die "cannot load backend $module:
$@" ; } $self-&gt;{backends}-&gt;{$name} =
$module-&gt;new($self-&gt;get_service, "/music/player/backend/$name");
}</p>
<p>Looking at this one might wonder what happens if the <code>die</code>
method is triggered. In such a scenario, rather than terminating the
service process, the error will be caught and propagated back to the
remote caller to deal with.</p>
<p>The player backends provide a method <code>get_track_types</code>
which returns an array reference of the music track types they support.
We can use this method to provide an API to allow easy retrieval of a
backend for a particular track type. This method will return a path with
which the backend object can be accessed</p>
<p>sub find_backend { my $self = shift; my $extension = shift; foreach
my $name (keys %{$self-&gt;{backends}}) { my $backend =
$self-&gt;{backends}-&gt;{$name}; foreach my $type
(@{$backend-&gt;get_track_types}) { if ($type eq $extension) { return
$backend-&gt;get_object_path; } } } die "no backend for type
$extension"; }</p>
<p>Lets take a quick moment to consider how this method would be used to
play a music track. If you've not already done so, refresh your memory
from Net::DBus::Tutorial::UsingObjects. Now, we have an MP3 file which
we wish to play, so we search for the path to a backend, then retrieve
the object for it, and play the track:</p>
<p>...get the music player service... # Ask for a path to a player for
mp3 files my $path = $service-&gt;find_backend("mp3"); # $path now
contains /music/player/backend/mpg123 # and we can get the backend
object my $backend = $service-&gt;get_object($path); # and finally play
the track
$backend-&gt;play("/vol/music/beck/guero/09-scarecrow.mp3");</p>
<h1>PROVIDING INTROSPECTION DATA</h1>
<p>The code above is a complete working object, ready to be registered
with a service, and since the parameters and return values for the two
methods are both simple strings we could stop there. In some cases,
however, one might want to be more specific about data types expected
for parameters, for example signed vs unsigned integers. Adding explicit
data typing also makes interaction with other programming languages more
reliable. Providing explicit data type definitions for exported method
is known in the DBus world as <code>Introspection</code>, and it makes
life much more reliable for users of one's service whom may be using a
strongly typed language such as C.</p>
<p>The first step in providing introspection data for a DBus object in
Perl, is to specify the name of the interface provided by the object.
This is typically a period separated string, by convention containing
the domain name of the application as its first component. Since most
Perl modules end up living on CPAN, one might use <code>org.cpan</code>
as the first component, followed by the package name of the module
(replacing :: with .), eg <code>org.cpan.music.player.manager</code>. If
it is not planned to host the module on CPAN, a personal/project domain
might be used eg <code>com.berrange.music.player.manager</code>. The
interface for an object is defined by loading the Net::DBus::Exporter
module, providing the interface as its first parameter. So the earlier
code example would be modified to look like:</p>
<p>package Music::Player::Manager; use base qw(Net::DBus); use
Net::DBus::Exporter qw(com.berrange.music.player.manager)</p>
<p>Next up, it is necessary to provide data types for the parameters and
return values of the methods. The Net::DBus::Exporter module provides a
method <code>dbus_method</code> for this purpose, which takes three
parameter, the name of the method being exported, an array reference of
parameter types, and an array reference of return types (the latter can
be omitted if there are no return values). This can be called at any
point in the module's code, but by convention it is preferable to
associate calls to <code>dbus_method</code> with the actual method
implementation, thus:</p>
<p>dbus_method("register_backend", ["string", "string"]); sub
register_backend { my $self = shift; my $name = shift; my $module =
shift; .. snipped rest of method body ... }</p>
<p>And, thus:</p>
<p>dbus_method("find_backend", ["string"], ["string"]) sub find_backend
{ my $self = shift; my $extension = shift; ... snip method body... }</p>
<h1>DEFINING A SERVICE</h1>
<p>Now that the objects have been written, it is time to define a
service. A service is nothing more than a well known name for a given
API contract. A contract can be thought of as a definition of a list of
object paths, and the corresponding interfaces they provide. So, someone
else could come along a provide an alternate music player implementation
using the Python or QT bindings for DBus, and if they provided the same
set of object paths &amp; interfaces, they could justifiably register
the same service on the bus.</p>
<p>The Net::DBus::Service module provides the means to register a
service. Its constructor expects a reference to the bus object (an
instance of Net::DBus), along with the name of the service. As with
interface names, the first component of a service name is usually
derived from a domain name, and then suffixed with the name of the
application, in our example forming <code>org.cpan.Music.Player</code>.
While some objects will be created on the fly during execution of the
application, others are created upon initial startup. The music player
manager object created earlier in this tutorial is an example of the
latter. It is typical to instantiate and register these objects in the
constructor for the service. Thus a service object for the music player
application would look like:</p>
<p>package Music::Player; use base qw(Net::DBus::Service); sub new { my
$class = shift; my $bus = shift; my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($bus,
"org.cpan.music.player"); bless $self, $class; $self-&gt;{manager} =
Music::Player::Manager-&gt;new($self); return $self; }</p>
<p>The Net::DBus::Service automatically provides one special object to
all services, under the path
<code>/org/freedesktop/DBus/Exporter</code>. This object implements the
<code>org.freedesktop.DBus.Exporter</code> interface which has a method
<code>ListObject</code>. This enables clients to determine a list of all
objects exported within a service. While not functionally necessary for
most applications, it is none-the-less a useful tool for developers
debugging applications, or wondering what a service provides.</p>
<h1>CONNECTING TO THE BUS</h1>
<p>The final step in getting our service up and running is to connect it
to the bus. This brings up an interesting conundrum, does one export the
service on the system bus (shared by all users &amp; processes on the
machine), or the session bus (one per user logged into a machine). In
some cases the answer, with only one of the two buses conceptually
making sense. In other cases, however, both the session &amp; system bus
are valid. In the former one would use the <code>session</code> or
&lt;system&gt; methods on Net::DBus to get a handle to the desired bus,
while in the latter case, the <code>find</code> method would be used.
This applies a heuristic to determine the correct bus based on execution
environment. In the case of the music player, either bus is relevant, so
the code to connect the service to the bus would look like:</p>
<p>use Net::DBus; my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find; my $player =
Music::Player-&gt;new($bus);</p>
<p>With the service attached to the bus, it is merely necessary to run
the main event processing loop to listen out for &amp; handle incoming
DBus messages. So the above code is modified to start a simple
reactor:</p>
<p>use Net::DBus; use Net::DBus::Reactor; my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;
my $player = Music::Player-&gt;new($bus);
Net::DBus::Reactor-&gt;main-&gt;run; exit 0;</p>
<p>Saving this code into a script <code>/usr/bin/music-player.pl</code>,
coding is complete and the service ready for use by clients on the
bus.</p>
<h1>SERVICE ACTIVATION</h1>
<p>One might now wonder how best to start the service, particularly if
it is a service capable of running on both the system and session buses.
DBus has the answer in the concept of <code>activation</code>. What
happens is that when a client on the bus attempts to call a method, or
register a signal handler against, a service not currently running, it
will first try and start the service. Service's which wish to
participate in this process merely need stick a simple service
definition file into the directory
<code>/usr/share/dbus-1/services</code>. The file should be named to
match the service name, with the file extension <code>.service</code>
appended. eg,
<code>/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.cpan.music.player.service</code>
The file contains two keys, first the name of the service, and second
the name of the executable used to run the service, or in this case the
Perl script. So, for our simple service the data file would contain:</p>
<p>[D-BUS Service] Name=org.cpan.music.player
Exec=/usr/bin/music-player.pl</p>
