<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::ParseXSDoc - Parse POD and XSub declarations from XS files.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This is the heart of an automatic API reference documentation system
for XS-based Perl modules. FIXME more info here!!</p>
<p>FIXME document recognized POD directives and the output data
structures</p>
<h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>xsdocparse (@filenames)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Parse xs files for xsub signatures and pod. Writes to standard output
a data structure suitable for eval'ing in another Perl script,
describing all the stuff found. The output contains three variables:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$xspods = ARRAYREF</dt>
<dd>
<p>array of pods found in the verbatim C portion of the XS file, listed
in the order found. These are assumed to pertain to the XS/C api, not
the Perl api. Any <code>=for apidoc</code> paragraphs following an
<code>=object</code> paragraphs in the verbatim sections are stripped
(as are the <code>=object</code> paragraphs), and will appear instead in
<code>$data-&gt;{$package}{pods}</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$data = HASHREF</dt>
<dd>
<p>big hash keyed by package name (as found in the MODULE line),
containing under each key a hash with all the xsubs and pods in that
package, in the order found. Packages are consolidated across multiple
files.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>FYI, this creates a new parser and calls <code>parse_file</code> on
it for each input filename; then calls <code>swizzle_pods</code> to
ensure that any <code>=for apidoc name</code> pods are matched up with
their target xsubs; and finally calls Data::Dumper to write the data to
stdout. So, if you want to get finer control over how the output is
created, or keep all the data in-process, now you know how. :-)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>$Glib::ParseXSDoc::verbose</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, this causes the parser to be verbose.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$parser = Glib::ParseXSDoc-&gt;new</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a new xsub parser.</p>
</dd>
<dt>string = $parser-&gt;package</dt>
<dd>
<p>Get the current package name. Falls back to the module name. Will be
undef if the parser hasn't reached the first MODULE line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HASHREF = $parser-&gt;pkgdata</dt>
<dd>
<p>The data hash corresponding to the current package, honoring the most
recently encountered <code>=for object</code> directive. Ensures that it
exists. Returns a reference to the member of the main data structure, so
modifications are permanent and useful.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$parser-&gt;parse_file (filename)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Parse one xs file. Stores all the collected data in
<em><code>$parser</code></em>'s internal data structures.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$parser-&gt;swizzle_pods</dt>
<dd>
<p>Match <code>=for apidoc</code> pods to xsubs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$parser-&gt;preprocess_pods</dt>
<dd>
<p>Honor the <code>_ _hide_ _</code> and <code>_ _function_ _</code>
directives in <code>=for apidoc</code> lines. We look for the strings
anywhere, but you'll typically have it at the end of the line, e.g.:
=for apidoc symname _ _hide_ _ for detached blocks =for apidoc
_ _hide_ _ for attached blocks =for apidoc symname _ _function_ _ for
functions rather than methods =for apidoc _ _function_ _ for functions
rather than methods</p>
</dd>
<dt>bool = $parser-&gt;is_module_line ($line)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Analyze <em><code>$line</code></em> to see if it contains an XS
MODULE directive. If so, returns true after setting the
<em><code>$parser</code></em>'s <em>module</em>, <em>package</em>, and
<em>prefix</em> accordingly.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$pod = $parser-&gt;slurp_pod_paragraph ($firstline,
$term_regex=/^=cut\s*/)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Slurp up POD lines from <em><code>$filehandle</code></em> from here
to the next <em><code>$term_regex</code></em> or EOF. Since you probably
already read a line to determine that we needed to start a pod, you can
pass that first line to be included.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$xsub = $parser-&gt;parse_xsub (\@lines)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$xsub = $parser-&gt;parse_xsub (@lines)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Parse an xsub header, in the form of a list of lines, into a data
structure describing the xsub. That includes pulling out the argument
types, aliases, and code type. Without artificial intelligence, we
cannot reliably determine anything about the types or number of
parameters returned from xsubs with PPCODE bodies. OUTLIST parameters
are pulled from the args list and put into an outlist key. IN_OUTLIST
parameters are put into both. Data type names are not mangled at all.
Note that the method can take either a list of lines or a reference to a
list of lines. The flat list form is provided for compatibility; the
reference form is preferred, to avoid duplicating a potentially large
list of strings.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$parser-&gt;clean_out_empty_pods</dt>
<dd>
<p>Looks through the data member of the parser and removes any keys (and
associated values) when no pod, enums, and xsubs exist for the
package.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
