<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::MainWindow - Root widget of a widget tree</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk; my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new( ... options ... ); my $this =
$mw-&gt;ThisWidget -&gt; pack ; my $that = $mw-&gt;ThatWidget; ...
MainLoop;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Perl/Tk applications (which have windows associated with them) create
one or more <strong>MainWindow</strong>s which act as the containers and
parents of the other widgets.</p>
<p><strong>Tk::MainWindow</strong> is a special kind of Toplevel widget.
It is the root of a widget tree. Therefore <code>$mw-&gt;Parent</code>
returns <code>undef</code>.</p>
<p>The default title of a MainWindow is the basename of the script
(actually the Class name used for options lookup, i.e. with basename
with inital caps) or 'Ptk' as the fallback value. If more than one
MainWindow is created or several instances of the script are running at
the same time the string <code>" #n"</code> is appended where the number
<code>n</code> is set to get a unique value.</p>
<p>Unlike the standard Tcl/Tk's wish, perl/Tk allows you to create
several MainWindows. When the <em>last</em> <strong>MainWindow</strong>
is destroyed the Tk eventloop exits (the eventloop is entered with the
call of <code>MainLoop</code>). Various resources (bindings, fonts,
images, colors) are maintained or cached for each MainWindow, so each
MainWindow consumes more resources than a Toplevel. However multiple
MainWindows can make sense when the user can destroy them
independently.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>You can apply all methods that a Toplevel widget accepts.</p>
<p>The method <em><code>$w</code></em>-&gt;<strong>MainWindow</strong>
applied to any widget will return the <strong>MainWindow</strong> to
which the widget belongs (the MainWindow belongs to itself).</p>
<h1>MISSING</h1>
<p>Documentation is incomplete. Here are <em>some</em> missing items
that should be explained in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new mechanism for MainWindows is slightly different to other
widgets.</p></li>
<li><p>There no explanation about what resources are bound to a
MainWindow (e.g., ClassInit done per MainWindow)</p></li>
<li><p>Passing of command line options to override or augment arguments
of the <code>new</code> method (see Tk::CmdLine).</p></li>
</ul>
