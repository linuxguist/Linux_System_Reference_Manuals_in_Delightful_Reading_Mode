<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::place - Geometry manager for fixed or rubber-sheet placement</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>   <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>place</strong>?(<em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>?,
<em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>, ...)?</p>
<p>   <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>placeForget</strong></p>

<p>   <em><code>$master</code></em>-&gt;<strong>placeSlaves</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The placer is a geometry manager for Tk. It provides simple fixed
placement of windows, where you specify the exact size and location of
one window, called the <em>slave</em>, within another window, called the
<em>master</em>. The placer also provides rubber-sheet placement, where
you specify the size and location of the slave in terms of the
dimensions of the master, so that the slave changes size and location in
response to changes in the size of the master. Lastly, the placer allows
you to mix these styles of placement so that, for example, the slave has
a fixed width and height but is centered inside the master.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$slave-&gt;place?(-option=&gt;value?, -option=&gt;value, ...?)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>place</strong> method arranges for the placer to manage
the geometry of <em><code>$slave</code></em>. The remaining arguments
consist of one or more <em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em> pairs that
specify the way in which <em><code>$slave</code></em>'s geometry is
managed. <em>-option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
placeConfigure method. The <strong>place</strong> method returns
<em><code>$slave</code></em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$slave-&gt;placeConfigure?(-option=&gt;value?, -option=&gt;value,
...?)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the geometry options of the
<em><code>$slave</code></em>. If no option is specified, this method
returns a list describing the available options (see Tk_ConfigureInfo
for information on the format of this list). If option is specified with
no value, then the command returns a list describing the one named
option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
value returned if no option is specified). If one or more option-value
pairs are specified, then the method modifies the given option(s) to
have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
<code>undef</code>. The following <em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>
pairs are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor =&gt; where</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Where</em> specifies which point of <em><code>$slave</code></em>
is to be positioned at the (x,y) location selected by the
<strong>-x</strong>, <strong>-y</strong>, <strong>-relx</strong>, and
<strong>-rely</strong> options. The anchor point is in terms of the
outer area of <em><code>$slave</code></em> including its border, if any.
Thus if <em>where</em> is <strong>se</strong> then the lower-right
corner of <em><code>$slave</code></em>'s border will appear at the given
(x,y) location in the master. The anchor position defaults to
<strong>nw</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-bordermode =&gt; mode</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Mode</em> determines the degree to which borders within the
master are used in determining the placement of the slave. The default
and most common value is <strong>inside</strong>. In this case the
placer considers the area of the master to be the innermost area of the
master, inside any border: an option of
<strong>-x</strong>=&gt;<strong>0</strong> corresponds to an
x-coordinate just inside the border and an option of
<strong>-relwidth</strong>=&gt;1.0 means <em><code>$slave</code></em>
will fill the area inside the master's border. If <em>mode</em> is
<strong>outside</strong> then the placer considers the area of the
master to include its border; this mode is typically used when placing
<em><code>$slave</code></em> outside its master, as with the options
<strong>-x</strong>=&gt;<strong>0</strong>,
<strong>-y</strong>=&gt;<strong>0</strong>,
<strong>-anchor</strong>=&gt;<strong>ne</strong>. Lastly, <em>mode</em>
may be specified as <strong>ignore</strong>, in which case borders are
ignored: the area of the master is considered to be its official X area,
which includes any internal border but no external border. A bordermode
of <strong>ignore</strong> is probably not very useful.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-height =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the height for <em><code>$slave</code></em>
in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>). The height will be the outer dimension
of <em><code>$slave</code></em> including its border, if any. If
<em>size</em> is an empty string, or if no <strong>-height</strong> or
<strong>-relheight</strong> option is specified, then the height
requested internally by the window will be used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-in =&gt; $master</dt>
<dd>
<p><em><code>$master</code></em> is the reference to the window relative
to which <em><code>$slave</code></em> is to be placed.
<em><code>$master</code></em> must either be
<em><code>$slave</code></em>'s parent or a descendant of
<em><code>$slave</code></em>'s parent. In addition,
<em><code>$master</code></em> and <em><code>$slave</code></em> must both
be descendants of the same top-level window. These restrictions are
necessary to guarantee that <em><code>$slave</code></em> is visible
whenever <em><code>$master</code></em> is visible. If this option isn't
specified then the master defaults to <em><code>$slave</code></em>'s
parent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-relheight =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the height for <em><code>$slave</code></em>.
In this case the height is specified as a floating-point number relative
to the height of the master: 0.5 means <em><code>$slave</code></em> will
be half as high as the master, 1.0 means <em><code>$slave</code></em>
will have the same height as the master, and so on. If both
<strong>-height</strong> and <strong>-relheight</strong> are specified
for a slave, their values are summed. For example,
<strong>-relheight</strong>=&gt;1.0, <strong>-height</strong>=&gt;-2
makes the slave 2 pixels shorter than the master.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-relwidth =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the width for <em><code>$slave</code></em>.
In this case the width is specified as a floating-point number relative
to the width of the master: 0.5 means <em><code>$slave</code></em> will
be half as wide as the master, 1.0 means <em><code>$slave</code></em>
will have the same width as the master, and so on. If both
<strong>-width</strong> and <strong>-relwidth</strong> are specified for
a slave, their values are summed. For example,
<strong>-relwidth</strong>=&gt;1.0, <strong>-width</strong>=&gt;5 makes
the slave 5 pixels wider than the master.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-relx =&gt; location</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the x-coordinate within the master window
of the anchor point for <em><code>$slave</code></em> widget. In this
case the location is specified in a relative fashion as a floating-point
number: 0.0 corresponds to the left edge of the master and 1.0
corresponds to the right edge of the master. <em>Location</em> need not
be in the range 0.0-1.0. If both <strong>-x</strong> and
<strong>-relx</strong> are specified for a slave then their values are
summed. For example, "<strong>-relx</strong>=&gt;0.5,
<strong>-x</strong>=-2" positions the left edge of the slave 2 pixels to
the left of the center of its master.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-rely =&gt; location</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the y-coordinate within the master window
of the anchor point for <em><code>$slave</code></em> widget. In this
case the value is specified in a relative fashion as a floating-point
number: 0.0 corresponds to the top edge of the master and 1.0
corresponds to the bottom edge of the master. <em>Location</em> need not
be in the range 0.0-1.0. If both <strong>-y</strong> and
<strong>-rely</strong> are specified for a slave then their values are
summed. For example, <strong>-rely</strong>=&gt;0.5,
<strong>-x</strong>=&gt;3 positions the top edge of the slave 3 pixels
below the center of its master.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-width =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the width for <em><code>$slave</code></em> in
screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>). The width will be the outer width of
<em><code>$slave</code></em> including its border, if any. If
<em>size</em> is an empty string, or if no <strong>-width</strong> or
<strong>-relwidth</strong> option is specified, then the width requested
internally by the window will be used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-x =&gt; location</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the x-coordinate within the master window
of the anchor point for <em><code>$slave</code></em> widget. The
location is specified in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>) and need not lie within the bounds of the
master window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-y =&gt; location</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the y-coordinate within the master window
of the anchor point for <em><code>$slave</code></em> widget. The
location is specified in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>) and need not lie within the bounds of the
master window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the same value is specified separately with two different options,
such as <strong>-x</strong> and <strong>-relx</strong>, then the most
recent option is used and the older one is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$slave-&gt;placeForget</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>placeForget</strong> method causes the placer to stop
managing the geometry of <em><code>$slave</code></em>. As a side effect
of this method call <em><code>$slave</code></em> will be unmapped so
that it doesn't appear on the screen. If <em><code>$slave</code></em>
isn't currently managed by the placer then the method call has no
effect. <strong>placeForget</strong> returns an empty string as
result.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$slave-&gt;placeInfo</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>placeInfo</strong> method returns a list giving the
current configuration of <em><code>$slave</code></em>. The list consists
of <em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em> pairs in exactly the same form as
might be specified to the <strong>place</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$slave-&gt;placeSlaves</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>placeSlaves</strong> method returns a list of all the
slave windows for which <em><code>$master</code></em> is the master. If
there are no slaves for <em><code>$master</code></em> then an empty list
is returned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the configuration of a window has been retrieved with
<strong>placeInfo</strong>, that configuration can be restored later by
first using <strong>placeForget</strong> to erase any existing
information for the window and then invoking <strong>place</strong> with
the saved information.</p>
<h1>FINE POINTS</h1>
<p>It is not necessary for the master window to be the parent of the
slave window. This feature is useful in at least two situations. First,
for complex window layouts it means you can create a hierarchy of
subwindows whose only purpose is to assist in the layout of the parent.
The ``<em>real children</em>'' of the parent (i.e. the windows that are
significant for the application's user interface) can be children of the
parent yet be placed inside the windows of the geometry-management
hierarchy. This means that the path names of the ``<em>real
children</em>'' don't reflect the geometry-management hierarchy and
users can specify options for the real children without being aware of
the structure of the geometry-management hierarchy.</p>
<p>A second reason for having a master different than the slave's parent
is to tie two siblings together. For example, the placer can be used to
force a window always to be positioned centered just below one of its
siblings by specifying the configuration</p>
<p>    <strong>-in</strong>=&gt;<em><code>$sibling</code></em>,
<strong>-relx</strong>=&gt;0.5, <strong>-rely</strong>=&gt;1.0,
<strong>-anchor</strong>=&gt;'n',
<strong>-bordermode</strong>=&gt;'outside'</p>
<p>Whenever the <em><code>$sibling</code></em> widget is repositioned in
the future, the slave will be repositioned as well.</p>
<p>Unlike many other geometry managers (such as the packer) the placer
does not make any attempt to manipulate the geometry of the master
windows or the parents of slave windows (i.e. it doesn't set their
requested sizes). To control the sizes of these windows, make them
windows like frames and canvases that provide configuration options for
this purpose.</p>
