<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Wm - Communicate with window manager</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>    <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>-&gt;<em>method</em>(?<em>args</em>?)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>wm</strong> methods are used to interact with window
managers in order to control such things as the title for a window, its
geometry, or the increments in terms of which it may be resized. The
<strong>wm</strong> methods can take any of a number of different forms,
depending on the particular <em>method</em> argument. All of the forms
expect <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, which must be a top-level window
object.</p>
<p>The legal forms for the <strong>wm</strong> methods are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;aspect(?minNumer minDenom maxNumer maxDenom?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>minNumer</em>, <em>minDenom</em>, <em>maxNumer</em>, and
<em>maxDenom</em> are all specified, then they will be passed to the
window manager and the window manager should use them to enforce a range
of acceptable aspect ratios for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. The
aspect ratio of <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> (width/length) will be
constrained to lie between <em>minNumer</em>/<em>minDenom</em> and
<em>maxNumer</em>/<em>maxDenom</em>. If <em>minNumer</em> etc. are all
specified as empty strings, then any existing aspect ratio restrictions
are removed. If <em>minNumer</em> etc. are specified, then the method
returns an empty string. Otherwise, it returns a array containing four
elements, which are the current values of <em>minNumer</em>,
<em>minDenom</em>, <em>maxNumer</em>, and <em>maxDenom</em> (if no
aspect restrictions are in effect, then an empty string is
returned).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;attributes( ?args? );</dt>
<dd>
<p>This subcommand returns or sets platform specific attributes
associated with a window.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;attributes;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of the platform specific flags and their values.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;attributes( ?option? );</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the value for the specific option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;attributes( ?option value option value...? );</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets one or more of the values. The values are as follows: On
Windows, <strong>-disabled</strong> gets or sets whether the window is
in a disabled state. <strong>-toolwindow</strong> gets or sets the style
of the window to toolwindow (as defined in the MSDN).
<strong>-topmost</strong> gets or sets whether this is a topmost window
(displays above all other windows). On Macintosh, there are currently no
special attribute values. On Unix, there are currently no special
attribute values.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;client(?name?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>name</em> is specified, this method stores <em>name</em>
(which should be the name of the host on which the application is
executing) in <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s
<strong>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</strong> property for use by the window
manager or session manager. The method returns an empty string in this
case. If <em>name</em> isn't specified, the method returns the last name
set in a <strong>client</strong> method for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. If <em>name</em> is specified as an
empty string, the method deletes the <strong>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</strong>
property from <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;colormapwindows(?windowList?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is used to manipulate the
<strong>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</strong> property, which provides
information to the window managers about windows that have private
colormaps. If <em>windowList</em> isn't specified, the method returns a
list whose elements are the names of the windows in the
<strong>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</strong> property. If <em>windowList</em> is
specified, it consists of a list of widgets; the method overwrites the
<strong>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</strong> property with the given windows and
returns an empty string. The <strong>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</strong>
property should normally contain a list of the internal windows within
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> whose colormaps differ from their
parents. The order of the windows in the property indicates a priority
order: the window manager will attempt to install as many colormaps as
possible from the head of this list when <em><code>$widget</code></em>
gets the colormap focus. If <em><code>$widget</code></em> is not
included among the windows in <em>windowList</em>, Tk implicitly adds it
at the end of the <strong>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</strong> property, so that
its colormap is lowest in priority. If
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;colormapwindows is not invoked, Tk
will automatically set the property for each top-level window to all the
internal windows whose colormaps differ from their parents, followed by
the top-level itself; the order of the internal windows is undefined.
See the ICCCM documentation for more information on the
<strong>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</strong> property.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;command(?value?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>value</em> is specified, this method stores <em>value</em> in
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s <strong>WM_COMMAND</strong> property
for use by the window manager or session manager and returns an empty
string. <em>Value</em> must have proper list structure; the elements
should contain the words of the command used to invoke the application.
If <em>value</em> isn't specified then the method returns the last value
set in a <strong>command</strong> method for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. If <em>value</em> is specified as an
empty string, the method deletes the <strong>WM_COMMAND</strong>
property from <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;deiconify</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> to be displayed in normal
(non-iconified) form. This is done by mapping the window. If the window
has never been mapped then this method will not map the window, but it
will ensure that when the window is first mapped it will be displayed in
de-iconified form. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;focusmodel(?active|passive?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>active</strong> or <strong>passive</strong> is supplied as
an optional argument to the method, then it specifies the focus model
for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. In this case the method returns an
empty string. If no additional argument is supplied, then the method
returns the current focus model for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. An
<strong>active</strong> focus model means that
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> will claim the input focus for itself or
its descendants, even at times when the focus is currently in some other
application. <strong>Passive</strong> means that
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> will never claim the focus for itself:
the window manager should give the focus to
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> at appropriate times. However, once the
focus has been given to <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> or one of its
descendants, the application may re-assign the focus among
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s descendants. The focus model defaults
to <strong>passive</strong>, and Tk's <strong>focus</strong> method
assumes a passive model of focusing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;frame</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em><code>$widget</code></em> has been reparented by the window
manager into a decorative frame, the method returns the platform
specific window identifier for the outermost frame that contains
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> (the window whose parent is the root or
virtual root). If <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> hasn't been reparented
by the window manager then the method returns the platform specific
window identifier for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;geometry(?newGeometry?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>newGeometry</em> is specified, then the geometry of
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is changed and an empty string is
returned. Otherwise the current geometry for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is returned (this is the most recent
geometry specified either by manual resizing or in a
<strong>geometry</strong> method). <em>NewGeometry</em> has the form
<strong>=</strong><em>width</em><strong>x</strong><em>height</em><strong>+-</strong><em>x</em><strong>+-</strong><em>y</em>,
where any of <strong>=</strong>,
<em>width</em><strong>x</strong><em>height</em>, or
<strong>+-</strong><em>x</em><strong>+-</strong><em>y</em> may be
omitted. <em>Width</em> and <em>height</em> are positive integers
specifying the desired dimensions of <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. If
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is gridded (see GRIDDED GEOMETRY
MANAGEMENT below) then the dimensions are specified in grid units;
otherwise they are specified in pixel units. <em>X</em> and <em>y</em>
specify the desired location of <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> on the
screen, in pixels. If <em>x</em> is preceded by <strong>+</strong>, it
specifies the number of pixels between the left edge of the screen and
the left edge of <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s border; if preceded
by <strong>-</strong> then <em>x</em> specifies the number of pixels
between the right edge of the screen and the right edge of
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s border. If <em>y</em> is preceded by
<strong>+</strong> then it specifies the number of pixels between the
top of the screen and the top of <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s
border; if <em>y</em> is preceded by <strong>-</strong> then it
specifies the number of pixels between the bottom of
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s border and the bottom of the screen.
If <em>newGeometry</em> is specified as an empty string then any
existing user-specified geometry for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is
cancelled, and the window will revert to the size requested internally
by its widgets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;wmGrid(?baseWidth,baseHeight,widthInc,heightInc?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method indicates that <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is to be
managed as a gridded window. It also specifies the relationship between
grid units and pixel units. <em>BaseWidth</em> and <em>baseHeight</em>
specify the number of grid units corresponding to the pixel dimensions
requested internally by <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> using
<strong>Tk_GeometryRequest</strong>. <em>WidthInc</em> and
<em>heightInc</em> specify the number of pixels in each horizontal and
vertical grid unit. These four values determine a range of acceptable
sizes for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, corresponding to grid-based
widths and heights that are non-negative integers. Tk will pass this
information to the window manager; during manual resizing, the window
manager will restrict the window's size to one of these acceptable
sizes. Furthermore, during manual resizing the window manager will
display the window's current size in terms of grid units rather than
pixels. If <em>baseWidth</em> etc. are all specified as empty strings,
then <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> will no longer be managed as a
gridded window. If <em>baseWidth</em> etc. are specified then the return
value is an empty string. Otherwise the return value is a array
containing four elements corresponding to the current
<em>baseWidth</em>, <em>baseHeight</em>, <em>widthInc</em>, and
<em>heightInc</em>; if <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is not currently
gridded, then an empty string is returned. Note: this command should not
be needed very often, since the <strong>Tk_SetGrid</strong> library
procedure and the <strong>-setgrid</strong> option provide easier access
to the same functionality.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;group(?$widget?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em><code>$widget</code></em> is specified, it is the the leader
of a group of related windows. The window manager may use this
information, for example, to unmap all of the windows in a group when
the group's leader is iconified. <em><code>$widget</code></em> may be
specified as an empty string to remove <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>
from any group association. If <em><code>$widget</code></em> is
specified then the method returns an empty string; otherwise it returns
the <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s current group leader, or an empty
string if <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> isn't part of any group.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconbitmap(?bitmap?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>bitmap</em> is specified, then it names a bitmap in the
standard forms accepted by Tk (see the <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>
documentation for details). This <em>black and white</em> bitmap is
passed to the window manager to be displayed in
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s icon, and the method returns an empty
string. If an empty string is specified for <em>bitmap</em>, then any
current icon bitmap or image is cancelled for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. If <em>bitmap</em> is specified then
the method returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns the name of the
current icon bitmap associated with <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, or
an empty string if <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> has no icon
bitmap.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconify</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> to be iconified. It
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> hasn't yet been mapped for the first
time, this method will arrange for it to appear in the iconified state
when it is eventually mapped.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconimage(?image?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>image</em> is specified, then it names a normal Tk image. This
image is rendered into a private <em>coloured</em> bitmap which is
passed to the window manager to be displayed in
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s icon, and the method returns an empty
string. If an empty string is specified for <em>image</em>, then any
current icon bitmap or image is cancelled for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. If <em>image</em> is specified then the
method returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns the name of the
current icon image associated with <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, or
an empty string if <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> has no icon image.
The private pixmap is not pre-cleared so images which are partly
transparent display rubbish in their transparent parts. The sizes of
images that can be used as icons in this manner are platform dependent.
On Win32 this sets the large icon, which should be 32x32, it will
automatically be scaled down to 16x16 for use as a small icon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconmask(?bitmap?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>bitmap</em> is specified, then it names a bitmap in the
standard forms accepted by Tk (see the <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>
documentation for details). This bitmap is passed to the window manager
to be used as a mask in conjunction with the <strong>iconbitmap</strong>
option: where the mask has zeroes no icon will be displayed; where it
has ones, the bits from the icon bitmap will be displayed. If an empty
string is specified for <em>bitmap</em> then any current icon mask is
cancelled for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> (this is equivalent to
specifying a bitmap of all ones). If <em>bitmap</em> is specified then
the method returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns the name of the
current icon mask associated with <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, or an
empty string if no mask is in effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconname(?newName?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>newName</em> is specified, then it is passed to the window
manager; the window manager should display <em>newName</em> inside the
icon associated with <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. In this case an
empty string is returned as result. If <em>newName</em> isn't specified
then the method returns the current icon name for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, or an empty string if no icon name has
been specified (in this case the window manager will normally display
the window's title, as specified with the <strong>title</strong>
method).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconphoto(?-default? image1 ?image2 ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the titlebar icon for window based on the named photo images. If
-default is specified, this is applied to all future created toplevels
as well. The data in the images is taken as a snapshot at the time of
invocation. If the images are later changed, this is not reflected to
the titlebar icons. Multiple images are accepted to allow different
images sizes (eg, 16x16 and 32x32) to be provided. The window manager
may scale pro- vided icons to an appropriate size. On Windows, the
images are packed into a Windows icon structure. This will override an
ico specified to wm iconbitmap, and vice versa. [NOTE: This is not
implemented yet!] On X, the images are arranged into the _NET_WM_ICON X
property, which most modern window managers support. A wm iconbitmap may
exist simultaneously. It is recommended to use not more than 2 icons,
placing the larger icon first. On Macintosh, this is currently does
nothing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconposition(?x y?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are specified, they are passed to the
window manager as a hint about where to position the icon for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. In this case an empty string is
returned. If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are specified as empty strings
then any existing icon position hint is cancelled. If neither <em>x</em>
nor <em>y</em> is specified, then the method returns a array containing
two values, which are the current icon position hints (if no hints are
in effect then an empty string is returned).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;iconwindow(?$widget?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em><code>$widget</code></em> is specified, it is a window to use
as icon for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>: when
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is iconified then
<em><code>$widget</code></em> will be mapped to serve as icon, and when
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is de-iconified then
<em><code>$widget</code></em> will be unmapped again. If
<em><code>$widget</code></em> is specified as an empty string then any
existing icon window association for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>
will be cancelled. If the <em><code>$widget</code></em> argument is
specified then an empty string is returned. Otherwise the method returns
the current icon window for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, or an empty
string if there is no icon window currently specified for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. Button press events are disabled for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> as long as it is an icon window; this is
needed in order to allow window managers to ``own'' those events. Note:
not all window managers support the notion of an icon window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;maxsize(?width,height?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> are specified, they give the
maximum permissible dimensions for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. For
gridded windows the dimensions are specified in grid units; otherwise
they are specified in pixel units. The window manager will restrict the
window's dimensions to be less than or equal to <em>width</em> and
<em>height</em>. If <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> are specified,
then the method returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns a array
with two elements, which are the maximum width and height currently in
effect. The maximum size defaults to the size of the screen. If resizing
has been disabled with the <strong>resizable</strong> method, then this
method has no effect. See the sections on geometry management below for
more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;minsize(?width,height?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> are specified, they give the
minimum permissible dimensions for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. For
gridded windows the dimensions are specified in grid units; otherwise
they are specified in pixel units. The window manager will restrict the
window's dimensions to be greater than or equal to <em>width</em> and
<em>height</em>. If <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> are specified,
then the method returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns a array
with two elements, which are the minimum width and height currently in
effect. The minimum size defaults to one pixel in each dimension. If
resizing has been disabled with the <strong>resizable</strong> method,
then this method has no effect. See the sections on geometry management
below for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;overrideredirect(?boolean?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>boolean</em> is specified, it must have a proper boolean form
and the override-redirect flag for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is
set to that value. If <em>boolean</em> is not specified then
<strong>1</strong> or <strong>0</strong> is returned to indicate whether
or not the override-redirect flag is currently set for
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. Setting the override-redirect flag for
a window causes it to be ignored by the window manager; among other
things, this means that the window will not be reparented from the root
window into a decorative frame and the user will not be able to
manipulate the window using the normal window manager mechanisms.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;positionfrom(?who?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>who</em> is specified, it must be either
<strong>program</strong> or <strong>user</strong>, or an abbreviation of
one of these two. It indicates whether <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s
current position was requested by the program or by the user. Many
window managers ignore program-requested initial positions and ask the
user to manually position the window; if <strong>user</strong> is
specified then the window manager should position the window at the
given place without asking the user for assistance. If <em>who</em> is
specified as an empty string, then the current position source is
cancelled. If <em>who</em> is specified, then the method returns an
empty string. Otherwise it returns <strong>user</strong> or
<code>$widget</code> to indicate the source of the window's current
position, or an empty string if no source has been specified yet. Most
window managers interpret ``no source'' as equivalent to
<strong>program</strong>. Tk will automatically set the position source
to <strong>user</strong> when a <strong>geometry</strong> method is
invoked, unless the source has been set explicitly to
<strong>program</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;protocol(?name?,?callback?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is used to manage window manager protocols such as
<strong>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</strong>. <em>Name</em> is the name of an atom
corresponding to a window manager protocol, such as
<strong>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</strong> or <strong>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</strong>
or <strong>WM_TAKE_FOCUS</strong>. If both <em>name</em> and
<em>callback</em> are specified, then <em>callback</em> is associated
with the protocol specified by <em>name</em>. <em>Name</em> will be
added to <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s <strong>WM_PROTOCOLS</strong>
property to tell the window manager that the application has a protocol
handler for <em>name</em>, and <em>callback</em> will be invoked in the
future whenever the window manager sends a message to the client for
that protocol. In this case the method returns an empty string. If
<em>name</em> is specified but <em>callback</em> isn't, then the current
callback for <em>name</em> is returned, or an empty string if there is
no handler defined for <em>name</em>. If <em>callback</em> is specified
as an empty string then the current handler for <em>name</em> is deleted
and it is removed from the <strong>WM_PROTOCOLS</strong> property on
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>; an empty string is returned. Lastly, if
neither <em>name</em> nor <em>callback</em> is specified, the method
returns a list of all the protocols for which handlers are currently
defined for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tk always defines a protocol handler for
<strong>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</strong>, even if you haven't asked for one
with <strong>protocol</strong>. If a <strong>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</strong>
message arrives when you haven't defined a handler, then Tk handles the
message by destroying the window for which it was received.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;resizable(?width,height?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method controls whether or not the user may interactively resize
a top-level window. If <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> are specified,
they are boolean values that determine whether the width and height of
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> may be modified by the user. In this
case the method returns an empty string. If <em>width</em> and
<em>height</em> are omitted then the method returns a list with two 0/1
elements that indicate whether the width and height of
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> are currently resizable. By default,
windows are resizable in both dimensions. If resizing is disabled, then
the window's size will be the size from the most recent interactive
resize or <strong>geometry</strong> method. If there has been no such
operation then the window's natural size will be used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;sizefrom(?who?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>who</em> is specified, it must be either
<strong>program</strong> or <strong>user</strong>, or an abbreviation of
one of these two. It indicates whether <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s
current size was requested by the program or by the user. Some window
managers ignore program-requested sizes and ask the user to manually
size the window; if <strong>user</strong> is specified then the window
manager should give the window its specified size without asking the
user for assistance. If <em>who</em> is specified as an empty string,
then the current size source is cancelled. If <em>who</em> is specified,
then the method returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns
<strong>user</strong> or <code>$widget</code> to indicate the source of
the window's current size, or an empty string if no source has been
specified yet. Most window managers interpret ``no source'' as
equivalent to <strong>program</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;stackorder( ?isabove|isbelow $toplevel? );</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stackorder command returns a list of toplevel windows in stacking
order, from lowest to highest. When a single toplevel window is passed,
the returned list recursively includes all of the window's children that
are toplevels. Only those toplevels that are currently mapped to the
screen are returned. The stackorder command can also be used to
determine if one toplevel is positioned above or below a second
toplevel. When two window arguments separated by either isabove or
isbelow are passed, a boolean result indicates whether or not the first
window is currently above or below the second window in the stacking
order.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;state(?newstate?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>newstate</em> is specified, the window will be set to the new
state, otherwise it returns the current state of
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>: either <strong>normal</strong>,
<strong>iconic</strong>, <strong>withdrawn</strong>,
<strong>icon</strong>, or (Windows only) <strong>zoomed</strong>. The
difference between <strong>iconic</strong> and <strong>icon</strong> is
that <strong>iconic</strong> refers to a window that has been iconified
(e.g., with the <strong>iconify</strong> method) while
<strong>icon</strong> refers to a window whose only purpose is to serve
as the icon for some other window (via the <strong>iconwindow</strong>
method). The <strong>icon</strong> state cannot be set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;title(?string?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>string</em> is specified, then it will be passed to the window
manager for use as the title for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> (the
window manager should display this string in
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s title bar). In this case the method
returns an empty string. If <em>string</em> isn't specified then the
method returns the current title for the
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>. The title for a window defaults to its
name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;transient(?master?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>master</em> is specified, then the window manager is informed
that <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is a transient window (e.g.
pull-down menu) working on behalf of <em>master</em> (where
<em>master</em> is a top-level window). Some window managers will use
this information to manage <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> specially. If
<em>master</em> is specified as an empty string then
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> is marked as not being a transient
window any more. If <em>master</em> is specified, then the method
returns an empty string. Otherwise the method returns the path name of
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>'s current master, or an empty string if
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em> isn't currently a transient window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;withdraw</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arranges for <em><code>$toplevel</code></em> to be withdrawn from the
screen. This causes the window to be unmapped and forgotten about by the
window manager. If the window has never been mapped, then this method
causes the window to be mapped in the withdrawn state. Not all window
managers appear to know how to handle windows that are mapped in the
withdrawn state. Note: it sometimes seems to be necessary to withdraw a
window and then re-map it (e.g. with <strong>deiconify</strong>) to get
some window managers to pay attention to changes in window attributes
such as group.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$toplevel-&gt;wrapper</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of two elements: the window id of the wrapper window
in which Tk has placed <em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, and the height
of the menu bar. The id is the one by which window manager will know
<em><code>$toplevel</code></em>, and so is appropriate place to add X
properties. The menu height is only returned on X. On Windows, this
value is always zero.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ICON SIZES</h1>
<p>The sizes of bitmaps/images that can be used as icons in this manner
are platform and window manager dependent. Unix window managers are
typically more tolerant than Win32. It is possible that coloured
<code>iconimage</code> icons may cause problems on some X window
managers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Win32 <code>iconimage</code> and <code>iconbitmap</code> set the
large icon, which should be 32x32, it will automatically be scaled down
to 16x16 for use as a small icon. Win32 ignores <code>iconwin</code>
requests.</p></li>
<li><p>KDE's kwm Accepts coloured <code>iconimage</code> and black and
white <code>iconbitmap</code> but will scale either to a small (14x14?)

<h1>GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT</h1>
<p>By default a top-level window appears on the screen in its
<em>natural size</em>, which is the one determined internally by its
widgets and geometry managers. If the natural size of a top-level window
changes, then the window's size changes to match. A top-level window can
be given a size other than its natural size in two ways. First, the user
can resize the window manually using the facilities of the window
manager, such as resize handles. Second, the application can request a
particular size for a top-level window using the
<strong>geometry</strong> method. These two cases are handled
identically by Tk; in either case, the requested size overrides the
natural size. You can return the window to its natural by invoking
<strong>geometry</strong> with an empty <em>geometry</em> string.</p>
<p>Normally a top-level window can have any size from one pixel in each
dimension up to the size of its screen. However, you can use the
<strong>minsize</strong> and <strong>maxsize</strong> methods to limit
the range of allowable sizes. The range set by <strong>minsize</strong>
and <strong>maxsize</strong> applies to all forms of resizing, including
the window's natural size as well as manual resizes and the
<strong>geometry</strong> method. You can also use the method
<strong>resizable</strong> to completely disable interactive resizing in
one or both dimensions.</p>
<h1>GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT</h1>
<p>Gridded geometry management occurs when one of the widgets of an
application supports a range of useful sizes. This occurs, for example,
in a text editor where the scrollbars, menus, and other adornments are
fixed in size but the edit widget can support any number of lines of
text or characters per line. In this case, it is usually desirable to
let the user specify the number of lines or characters-per-line, either
with the <strong>geometry</strong> method or by interactively resizing
the window. In the case of text, and in other interesting cases also,
only discrete sizes of the window make sense, such as integral numbers
of lines and characters-per-line; arbitrary pixel sizes are not
useful.</p>
<p>Gridded geometry management provides support for this kind of
application. Tk (and the window manager) assume that there is a grid of
some sort within the application and that the application should be
resized in terms of <em>grid units</em> rather than pixels. Gridded
geometry management is typically invoked by turning on the
<strong>setGrid</strong> option for a widget; it can also be invoked
with the <strong>wmGrid</strong> method or by calling
<strong>Tk_SetGrid</strong>. In each of these approaches the particular
widget (or sometimes code in the application as a whole) specifies the
relationship between integral grid sizes for the window and pixel sizes.
To return to non-gridded geometry management, invoke
<strong>grid</strong> with empty argument strings.</p>
<p>When gridded geometry management is enabled then all the dimensions
specified in <strong>minsize</strong>, <strong>maxsize</strong>, and
<strong>geometry</strong> methods are treated as grid units rather than
pixel units. Interactive resizing is also carried out in even numbers of
grid units rather than pixels.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Most existing window managers appear to have bugs that affect the
operation of the <strong>wm</strong> methods. For example, some changes
won't take effect if the window is already active: the window will have
to be withdrawn and de-iconified in order to make the change happen.</p>
