<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>File::MimeInfo::Cookbook - various code snippets</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Some code snippets for non-basic uses of the File::MimeInfo
module:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Matching an extension</dt>
<dd>
<p>A file does not have to actually exist in order to get a mimetype for
it. This means that the following will work: my $extension = *.txt; my
$mimetype = mimetype( $extension );</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mimetyping an scalar</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you want to find the mimetype of a scalar value you need magic
mimetyping; after all a scalar doesn't have a filename or inode. What
you need to do is to use IO::Scalar : use File::MimeInfo::Magic; use
IO::Scalar; my $io_scalar = new IO::Scalar \$data; my $mimetype =
mimetype( $io_scalar ); In fact most other <code>IO::</code> will work
as long as they support the <code>seek()</code> and <code>read()</code>
methods. Of course if you want really obscure things to happen you can
always write your own IO object and feed it in there. Be aware that when
using a filehandle like this you need to set the <code>:utf8</code>
binmode yourself if appropriate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mimetyping a filehandle</dt>
<dd>
<p>Regrettably for non-seekable filehandles like STDIN simply using an
<code>IO::</code> object will not work. You will need to buffer enough
of the data for a proper mimetyping. For example you could mimetype data
from STDIN like this: use File::MimeInfo::Magic; use IO::Scalar; my
$data; read(STDIN, $data, $File::MimeInfo::Magic::max_buffer); my
$io_scalar = new IO::Scalar \$data; my $mimetype = mimetype( $io_scalar
); Be aware that when using a filehandle like this you need to set the
<code>:utf8</code> binmode yourself if appropriate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Creating a new filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>Say you have a temporary file that you want to save with a more
proper filename. use File::MimeInfo::Magic qw#mimetype extensions#; use
File::Copy; my $tmpfile = /tmp/foo; my $mimetype = mimetype($tmpfile);
my $extension = extensions($mimetype); my $newfile = untitled1; $newfile
.= ..$extension if length $extension; move($tmpfile, $newfile);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Force the use of a certain database directory</dt>
<dd>
<p>Normally you just need to add the dir where your mime database lives
to either the XDG_DATA_HOME or XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variables for
it to be found. But in some rare cases you may want to by-pass this
system all together. Try one of the following: @File::MimeInfo::DIRS =
(/home/me/share/mime); eval use File::MimeInfo; die if $@; or: use
File::MimeInfo; @File::MimeInfo::DIRS = (/home/me/share/mime);
File::MimeInfo-&gt;rehash(); This can also be used for switching between
databases at run time while leaving other XDG configuration stuff
alone.</p>
