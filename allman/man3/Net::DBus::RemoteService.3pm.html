<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Net::DBus::RemoteService - Access services provided on the bus</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find; my $service =
$bus-&gt;get_service("org.freedesktop.DBus"); my $object =
$service-&gt;get_object("/org/freedesktop/DBus"); foreach
(@{$object-&gt;ListNames}) { print "$_\n"; }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This object provides a handle to a remote service on the bus. From
this handle it is possible to access objects associated with the
service. If a service is not running, an attempt will be made to
activate it the first time a method is called against one of its
objects.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>my $service = Net::DBus::RemoteService-&gt;new($bus, $owner,
$service_name);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a new handle for a remote service. The <code>$bus</code>
parameter is an instance of Net::DBus, <code>$owner</code> is the name
of the client providing the service, while <code>$service_name</code> is
the well known name of the service on the bus. Service names consist of
two or more tokens, separated by periods, while the tokens comprise the
letters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _, for example
<code>org.freedesktop.DBus</code>. There is generally no need to call
this constructor, instead the <code>get_service</code> method on
Net::DBus should be used. This caches handles to remote services,
eliminating repeated retrieval of introspection data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $bus = $service-&gt;get_bus;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieves a handle for the bus to which this service is attached. The
returned object will be an instance of Net::DBus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $service_name = $service-&gt;get_service_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieves the name of the remote service as known to the bus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $owner_name = $service-&gt;get_owner_name;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieves the name of the client owning the service at the time it
was connected to.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $object = $service-&gt;get_object($object_path[, $interface]);
=item my $object = $service-&gt;get_object($object_path, \%params);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieves a handle to the remote object provided by the service with
the name of <code>$object_path</code>. If the optional
<code>$interface</code> parameter is provided, the object will
immediately be cast to the designated interface. NB, it is only
necessary to cast an object to a specific interface if there are
multiple interfaces on the object providing methods with the same name,
or the remote object does support introspection. The returned object
will be an instance of Net::DBus::RemoteObject. An alternate form of the
method is available, passing a hash reference of extra parameters. Valid
keys in the hash are <code>interface</code> specifying the interface
name to cast to, and <code>timeout</code> specifying a timeout in
milliseconds</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $timeout = $service-&gt;timeout(60 * 1000);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets or retrieves the timeout value which will be used for DBus
requests belongs to this service. The value is in milliseconds. If the
timeout for a service is undefined, then the default timeout from the
bus will apply.</p>
</dd>
