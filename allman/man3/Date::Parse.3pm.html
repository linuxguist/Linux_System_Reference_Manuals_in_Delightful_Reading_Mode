<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Date::Parse - Parse date strings into time values</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Date::Parse; $time = str2time($date);
($ss,$mm,$hh,$day,$month,$year,$zone) = strptime($date);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><code>Date::Parse</code> provides two routines for parsing date
strings into time values.</p>
<dl>
<dt>str2time(DATE [, ZONE])</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>str2time</code> parses <code>DATE</code> and returns a unix
time value, or undef upon failure. <code>ZONE</code>, if given,
specifies the timezone to assume when parsing if the date string does
not specify a timezone.</p>
</dd>
<dt>strptime(DATE [, ZONE])</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>strptime</code> takes the same arguments as str2time but
returns an array of values
<code>($ss,$mm,$hh,$day,$month,$year,$zone,$century)</code>. Elements
are only defined if they could be extracted from the date string. The
<code>$zone</code> element is the timezone offset in seconds from GMT.
An empty array is returned upon failure.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT</h1>
<p>Date::Parse is capable of parsing dates in several languages, these
include English, French, German and Italian.</p>
<p>$lang = Date::Language-&gt;new(German); $lang-&gt;str2time("25 Jun
1996 21:09:55 +0100");</p>
<h1>EXAMPLE DATES</h1>
<p>Below is a sample list of dates that are known to be parsable with
Date::Parse</p>
<p>1995:01:24T09:08:17.1823213 ISO-8601 1995-01-24T09:08:17.1823213 Wed,
16 Jun 94 07:29:35 CST Comma and day name are optional Thu, 13 Oct 94
10:13:13 -0700 Wed, 9 Nov 1994 09:50:32 -0500 (EST) Text in ()s will be
ignored. 21 dec 17:05 Will be parsed in the current time zone 21-dec
17:05 21/dec 17:05 21/dec/93 17:05 1999 10:02:18 "GMT" 16 Nov 94
22:28:20 PST</p>
<h1>LIMITATION</h1>
<p>Date::Parse uses Time::Local internally, so is limited to only
parsing dates which result in valid values for Time::Local::timelocal.
This generally means dates between 1901-12-17 00:00:00 GMT and
2038-01-16 23:59:59 GMT</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>When both the month and the date are specified in the date as numbers
they are always parsed assuming that the month number comes before the
date. This is the usual format used in American dates.</p>
<p>The reason why it is like this and not dynamic is that it must be
deterministic. Several people have suggested using the current locale,
but this will not work as the date being parsed may not be in the format
of the current locale.</p>
<p>My plans to address this, which will be in a future release, is to
allow the programmer to state what order they want these values parsed
in.</p>
