<p>Specifies a callback to invoke to change the view in the widget
associated with the scrollbar. When a user requests a view change by
manipulating the scrollbar, the callback is invoked. The callback is
passed additional arguments as described later. This option almost
always has a value such as <strong>[xview =&gt;
<code>$widget</code>]</strong> or <strong>[yview =&gt;
<code>$widget</code>]</strong>, consisting of the a widget object and
either <strong>xview</strong> (if the scrollbar is for horizontal
scrolling) or <strong>yview</strong> (for vertical scrolling). All
scrollable widgets have <strong>xview</strong> and
<strong>yview</strong> methods that take exactly the additional
arguments appended by the scrollbar as described in SCROLLING COMMANDS
below.</p>

<p>Specifies the desired narrow dimension of the scrollbar window, not
including 3-D border, if any. For vertical scrollbars this will be the
width and for horizontal scrollbars this will be the height. The value
may have any of the forms acceptable to
<strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Scrollbar</strong> method creates a new window (given by
the <code>$widget</code> argument) and makes it into a scrollbar widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the scrollbar
such as its colors, orientation, and relief. The
<strong>scrollbar</strong> command returns its <code>$widget</code>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <code>$widget</code>, but <code>$widget</code>'s parent
must exist.</p>
<p>A scrollbar is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of
the scrollbar, and a <em>slider</em> in the middle portion of the
scrollbar. It provides information about what is visible in an
<em>associated window</em> that displays an document of some sort (such
as a file being edited or a drawing). The position and size of the
slider indicate which portion of the document is visible in the
associated window. For example, if the slider in a vertical scrollbar
covers the top third of the area between the two arrows, it means that
the associated window displays the top third of its document.</p>
<p>Scrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the associated window by
clicking or dragging with the mouse. See BINDINGS below for details.</p>
<h1>ELEMENTS</h1>
<p>A scrollbar displays five elements, which are referred to in the
methods for the scrollbar:</p>
<dl>
<dt>arrow1</dt>
<dd>
<p>The top or left arrow in the scrollbar.</p>
</dd>
<dt>trough1</dt>
<dd>
<p>The region between the slider and <strong>arrow1</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>slider</dt>
<dd>
<p>The rectangle that indicates what is visible in the associated
widget.</p>
</dd>
<dt>trough2</dt>
<dd>
<p>The region between the slider and <strong>arrow2</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>arrow2</dt>
<dd>
<p>The bottom or right arrow in the scrollbar.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Scrollbar</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for scrollbar
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$scrollbar-&gt;activate(?element?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the element indicated by <em>element</em> as active, which
causes it to be displayed as specified by the
<strong>activeBackground</strong> and <strong>activeRelief</strong>
options. The only element values understood by this command are
<strong>arrow1</strong>, <strong>slider</strong>, or
<strong>arrow2</strong>. If any other value is specified then no element
of the scrollbar will be active. If <em>element</em> is not specified,
the command returns the name of the element that is currently active, or
an empty string if no element is active.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$scrollbar-&gt;delta(deltaX, deltaY)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a real number indicating the fractional change in the
scrollbar setting that corresponds to a given change in slider position.
For example, if the scrollbar is horizontal, the result indicates how
much the scrollbar setting must change to move the slider
<em>deltaX</em> pixels to the right (<em>deltaY</em> is ignored in this
case). If the scrollbar is vertical, the result indicates how much the
scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <em>deltaY</em> pixels
down. The arguments and the result may be zero or negative.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$scrollbar-&gt;fraction(x, y)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point
given by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> lies in the trough area of the
scrollbar. The value 0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough, the
value 1 corresponds to the bottom or right, 0.5 corresponds to the
middle, and so on. <em>X</em> and <em>y</em> must be pixel coordinates
relative to the scrollbar widget. If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> refer to
a point outside the trough, the closest point in the trough is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$scrollbar-&gt;get</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose elements
are the arguments to the most recent <strong>set</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$scrollbar-&gt;identify(x, y)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the element under the point given by <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> (such as <strong>arrow1</strong>), or an empty string if
the point does not lie in any element of the scrollbar. <em>X</em> and
<em>y</em> must be pixel coordinates relative to the scrollbar
widget.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$scrollbar-&gt;set(first, last)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is invoked by the scrollbar's associated widget to tell
the scrollbar about the current view in the widget. The command takes
two arguments, each of which is a real fraction between 0 and 1. The
fractions describe the range of the document that is visible in the
associated widget. For example, if <em>first</em> is 0.2 and
<em>last</em> is 0.4, it means that the first part of the document
visible in the window is 20% of the way through the document, and the
last visible part is 40% of the way through.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>SCROLLING COMMANDS</h1>
<p>When the user interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging
the slider, the scrollbar notifies the associated widget that it must
change its view. The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a
callback specified as the scrollbar's <strong>-command</strong> option.
The callback may take several forms. In each case, the initial arguments
passed are those specified in the <strong>-command</strong> callback
itself, which usually has a form like [<strong>yview</strong> =&gt;
<em><code>$widget</code></em>]. (Which will invoke
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>yview</strong>(...) where the
... part is as below. See Tk::callbacks for details.) The callback is
passed additional arguments as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>moveto,fraction</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Fraction</em> is a real number between 0 and 1. The widget should
adjust its view so that the point given by <em>fraction</em> appears at
the beginning of the widget. If <em>fraction</em> is 0 it refers to the
beginning of the document. 1.0 refers to the end of the document, 0.333
refers to a point one-third of the way through the document, and so
on.</p>
</dd>
<dt>scroll,number,units</dt>
<dd>
<p>The widget should adjust its view by <em>number</em> units. The units
are defined in whatever way makes sense for the widget, such as
characters or lines in a text widget. <em>Number</em> is either 1, which
means one unit should scroll off the top or left of the window, or -1,
which means that one unit should scroll off the bottom or right of the
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>scroll,number,page</dt>
<dd>
<p>The widget should adjust its view by <em>number</em> pages. It is up
to the widget to define the meaning of a page; typically it is slightly
less than what fits in the window, so that there is a slight overlap
between the old and new views. <em>Number</em> is either 1, which means
the next page should become visible, or -1, which means that the
previous page should become visible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>OLD COMMAND SYNTAX</h1>
<p>In versions of Tk before 4.0, the <strong>set</strong> and
<strong>get</strong> widget commands used a different form. This form is
still supported for backward compatibility, but it is deprecated. In the
old command syntax, the <strong>set</strong> method has the following
form:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$scrollbar-&gt;set(totalUnits, windowUnits, firstUnit,
lastUnit)</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form the arguments are all integers. <em>TotalUnits</em>
gives the total size of the object being displayed in the associated
widget. The meaning of one unit depends on the associated widget; for
example, in a text editor widget units might correspond to lines of
text. <em>WindowUnits</em> indicates the total number of units that can
fit in the associated window at one time. <em>FirstUnit</em> and
<em>lastUnit</em> give the indices of the first and last units currently
visible in the associated window (zero corresponds to the first unit of
the object).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Under the old syntax the <strong>get</strong> method returns a list
of four integers, consisting of the <em>totalUnits</em>,
<em>windowUnits</em>, <em>firstUnit</em>, and <em>lastUnit</em> values
from the last <strong>set</strong> method.</p>
<p>The callbacks generated by scrollbars also have a different form when
the old syntax is being used, the callback is passed a single
argument:</p>
<dl>
<dt>unit</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Unit</em> is an integer that indicates what should appear at the
top or left of the associated widget's window. It has the same meaning
as the <em>firstUnit</em> and <em>lastUnit</em> arguments to the
<strong>set</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The most recent <strong>set</strong> method determines whether or not
to use the old syntax. If it is given two real arguments then the new
syntax will be used in the future, and if it is given four integer
arguments then the old syntax will be used.</p>
<h1>BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for scrollbars that give them
the following default behavior. If the behavior is different for
vertical and horizontal scrollbars, the horizontal behavior is described
in parentheses.</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pressing button 1 over <strong>arrow1</strong> causes the view in the
associated widget to shift up (left) by one unit so that the document
appears to move down (right) one unit. If the button is held down, the
action auto-repeats.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pressing button 1 over <strong>trough1</strong> causes the view in
the associated widget to shift up (left) by one screenful so that the
document appears to move down (right) one screenful. If the button is
held down, the action auto-repeats.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pressing button 1 over the slider and dragging causes the view to
drag with the slider. If the <strong>jump</strong> option is true, then
the view doesn't drag along with the slider; it changes only when the
mouse button is released.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pressing button 1 over <strong>trough2</strong> causes the view in
the associated widget to shift down (right) by one screenful so that the
document appears to move up (left) one screenful. If the button is held
down, the action auto-repeats.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pressing button 1 over <strong>arrow2</strong> causes the view in the
associated widget to shift down (right) by one unit so that the document
appears to move up (left) one unit. If the button is held down, the
action auto-repeats.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If button 2 is pressed over the trough or the slider, it sets the
view to correspond to the mouse position; dragging the mouse with button
2 down causes the view to drag with the mouse. If button 2 is pressed
over one of the arrows, it causes the same behavior as pressing button
1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If button 1 is pressed with the Control key down, then if the mouse
is over <strong>arrow1</strong> or <strong>trough1</strong> the view
changes to the very top (left) of the document; if the mouse is over
<strong>arrow2</strong> or <strong>trough2</strong> the view changes to
the very bottom (right) of the document; if the mouse is anywhere else
then the button press has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[8]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In vertical scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior as
mouse clicks over <strong>arrow1</strong> and <strong>arrow2</strong>,
respectively. In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[9]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In vertical scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same
behavior as mouse clicks over <strong>trough1</strong> and
<strong>trough2</strong>, respectively. In horizontal scrollbars these
keys have no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[10]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In horizontal scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior
as mouse clicks over <strong>arrow1</strong> and
<strong>arrow2</strong>, respectively. In vertical scrollbars these keys
have no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[11]</dt>
<dd>
<p>In horizontal scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same
behavior as mouse clicks over <strong>trough1</strong> and
<strong>trough2</strong>, respectively. In vertical scrollbars these
keys have no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[12]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Prior and Next keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over
<strong>trough1</strong> and <strong>trough2</strong>, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[13]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Home key adjusts the view to the top (left edge) of the
document.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[14]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The End key adjusts the view to the bottom (right edge) of the
document.</p>
</dd>
