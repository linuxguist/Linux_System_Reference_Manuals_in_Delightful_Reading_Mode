<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::overview - An overview of an Object Oriented Tk8 extension for
perl5</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><code>use Tk;</code></p>
<p><code>$main = MainWindow-&gt;new();</code></p>
<p><code>$widget = $main-&gt;</code><em><code>Widget</code></em><code>(...);</code></p>
<p><code>$widget-&gt;pack(...);</code></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><code>MainLoop;</code></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In writing the perl Tk extension, the goals were to provide a
complete interface to the latest production version of John Ousterhout's
Tk, while providing an Object Oriented interface to perl code.</p>
<h1>CONTENTS</h1>
<p>The package is composed of three loosely connected parts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>pTk - Converted Tk source</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>pTk</em> sub-directory is a copy of the C code of Tk8.x,
modified to allow use by languages other than the original Tcl. (The pTk
can be read as 'perl' Tk or 'portable' Tk, depending on your
sensibilities.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tk to Perl 'Glue'</dt>
<dd>
<p>The top level directory provides <em>Tk.xs</em> and <em>tkGlue.c</em>
which provide the perl-callable interfaces to pTk</p>
</dd>
<dt>Perl code for 'Widget' Classes</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>Tk</em> sub-directory contains the various perl modules that
comprise the Classes that are visible to Tk applications. The major
widgets such as <strong>Tk::Text</strong> are actually in separate
directories at the top level (e.g. <em>Text/*</em> for
<strong>Tk::Text</strong>) and are dynamically loaded as needed on
platforms which support perl5's <strong>DynaLoader</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CLASS HIERARCHY</h1>
<dl>
<dt>package Tk; - the 'base class'</dt>
<dd>
<p>All the command names documented in Tcl/Tk are made to look like perl
sub's and reside in the Tk package. Their names are all lower case.
Typically there are very few commands at this level which are called
directly by applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt>package Tk::Widget; - the 'Widget class'</dt>
<dd>
<p>There are no actual objects of the <strong>Tk::Widget</strong> class;
however all the various Tk window widgets inherit from it, and it in
turn inherits all the core Tk functions from Tk.
<strong>Tk::Widget</strong> provides various functions and interfaces
which are common to all Widgets. A widget is represented to perl as a
blessed reference to a hash. There are some members of the hash which
are private to Tk and its tkGlue code. Keys starting with
<strong>'.'</strong> and of the form
<strong>/^_[A-Z][A-Za-z_]+_$/</strong> (i.e. starting and ending in _
and with first char after _ being upper case) should be considered
reserved to <strong>Tk</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tk::Button, Tk::Entry, Tk::Text ...</dt>
<dd>
<p>There is one class for each of the Tk widget item types. Some of them
like <strong>Tk::Frame</strong> do very little indeed, and really only
exist so that they can be derived from or so that focus or menu
traversal can discover the kind of window being processed. Other
classes, <strong>Tk::Text</strong> for example, provide a lot of methods
used with Tk's bind to provide a rich keyboard/mouse interface to the
widgets' data. These widget classes also include conversions of the Tcl
code for event bindings, keyboard focus traversal, menu bars, and menu
keyboard traversal. All the Tcl functions have been converted, but the
names have changed (systematically) and they have been split up between
the various classes in what I hope is an appropriate manner. Name
changes are normally: dropping initial tk_ as the Tk-ness is implicit in
the <strong>Tk::</strong> prefix, and similarly dropping say Menu from
the name if it has been moved the Tk::Menu class. Thus 'proc
tkMenuNextEntry' becomes 'sub NextEntry' in the Tk::Menu package.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tk::Image</dt>
<dd>
<p>This does for Tk8.x's images what <strong>Tk::Widget</strong> does
for widgets. Images are new to Tk8.x and the class structure is not
mature either. There are three sub-classes <strong>Tk::Bitmap</strong>,
<strong>Tk::Pixmap</strong> and <strong>Tk::Photo</strong>. It is
possible to create dynamic or auto-loaded image types inherited from
<strong>Tk::Image</strong> for other image types or photo formats (e.g.
support for TIFF format).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Composite Widgets</dt>
<dd>
<p>A composite is some kind of 'frame' with subwidgets which give it
useful behaviour. <strong>Tk::Dialog</strong> is an example of a
composite widget classes built from the basic <strong>Tk</strong> ones.
It is intended that user code should not need to be aware that a
particular class is a composite, and create and configure such widgets
in the same manner as any other kind. The <strong>configure</strong>
mechanism and the methods of the class manipulate the subwidgets as
required. Composite widgets are implemented via
<strong>Tk::Frame</strong> and multiple inheritance. The two 'frame'
base classes <strong>Tk::Frame</strong> and
<strong>Tk::Toplevel</strong> include the additional class
<strong>Tk::Derived</strong> in their inheritance.
<strong>Tk::Derived</strong> provides methods to allow additional
<strong>configure</strong> options to be defined for a widget. A
Composite widget is typically defined as derived from
<strong>Tk::Frame</strong> or <strong>Tk::Toplevel</strong> (e.g.
<strong>Tk::Dialog</strong>).</p>
