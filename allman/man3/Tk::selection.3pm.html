<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Selection - Manipulate the X selection</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Selection</strong><em>Option</em>?(<em>args</em>)?</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command provides an interface to the X selection mechanism and
implements the full selection functionality described in the X
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM).</p>
<p>The widget object used to invoke the methods below determines which
display is used to access the selection. In order to avoid conflicts
with <strong>selection</strong> methods of widget classes (e.g.
<strong>Text</strong>) this set of methods uses the prefix
<strong>Selection</strong>. The following methods are currently
supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;SelectionClear?(-selection=&gt;selection)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>selection</em> exists anywhere on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display, clear it so that no window owns
the selection anymore. <em>Selection</em> specifies the X selection that
should be cleared, and should be an atom name such as PRIMARY or
CLIPBOARD; see the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual for
complete details. <em>Selection</em> defaults to PRIMARY. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;SelectionGet?(?-selection=&gt;selection?,?-type=&gt;type?)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieves the value of <em>selection</em> from
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display and returns it as a result.
<em>Selection</em> defaults to PRIMARY. <em>Type</em> specifies the form
in which the selection is to be returned (the desired ``target'' for
conversion, in ICCCM terminology), and should be an atom name such as
STRING or FILE_NAME; see the Inter-Client Communication Conventions
Manual for complete details. <em>Type</em> defaults to STRING. The
selection owner may choose to return the selection in any of several
different representation formats, such as STRING, ATOM, INTEGER, etc.
(this format is different than the selection type; see the ICCCM for all
the confusing details). If <em>format</em> is not STRING then things get
messy, the following description is from the Tcl/Tk man page as yet
incompetely translated for the perl version - it is misleading at best.
If the selection is returned in a non-string format, such as INTEGER or
ATOM, the <strong>SelectionGet</strong> converts it to a list of perl
values: atoms are converted to their textual names, and anything else is
converted integers. A goal of the perl port is to provide better
handling of different formats than Tcl/Tk does, which should be possible
given perl's wider range of ``types''. Although some thought went into
this in very early days of perl/Tk what exactly happens is still not
quite right and subject to change.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;SelectionHandle(?-selection=&gt;selection?,?-type=&gt;type?,?-format=&gt;format?
callback)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a handler for selection requests, such that <em>callback</em>
will be executed whenever <em>selection</em> is owned by
<em><code>$widget</code></em> and someone attempts to retrieve it in the
form given by <em>type</em> (e.g. <em>type</em> is specified in the
<strong>selection get</strong> command). <em>Selection</em> defaults to
PRIMARY, <em>type</em> defaults to STRING, and <em>format</em> defaults
to STRING. If <em>callback</em> is an empty string then any existing
handler for <em><code>$widget</code></em>, <em>type</em>, and
<em>selection</em> is removed. When <em>selection</em> is requested,
<em><code>$widget</code></em> is the selection owner, and <em>type</em>
is the requested type, <em>callback</em> will be executed with two
additional arguments. The two additional arguments are <em>offset</em>
and <em>maxBytes</em>: <em>offset</em> specifies a starting character
position in the selection and <em>maxBytes</em> gives the maximum number
of bytes to retrieve. The command should return a value consisting of at
most <em>maxBytes</em> of the selection, starting at position
<em>offset</em>. For very large selections (larger than
<em>maxBytes</em>) the selection will be retrieved using several
invocations of <em>callback</em> with increasing <em>offset</em> values.
If <em>callback</em> returns a string whose length is less than
<em>maxBytes</em>, the return value is assumed to include all of the
remainder of the selection; if the length of <em>callback</em>'s result
is equal to <em>maxBytes</em> then <em>callback</em> will be invoked
again, until it eventually returns a result shorter than
<em>maxBytes</em>. The value of <em>maxBytes</em> will always be
relatively large (thousands of bytes). If <em>callback</em> returns an
error (e.g. via <strong>die</strong>) then the selection retrieval is
rejected just as if the selection didn't exist at all. The
<em>format</em> argument specifies the representation that should be
used to transmit the selection to the requester (the second column of
Table 2 of the ICCCM), and defaults to STRING. If <em>format</em> is
STRING, the selection is transmitted as 8-bit ASCII characters (i.e.
just in the form returned by <em>command</em>). If <em>format</em> is
not STRING then things get messy, the following description is from the
Tcl/Tk man page as yet untranslated for the perl version - it is
misleading at best. If <em>format</em> is ATOM, then the return value
from <em>command</em> is divided into fields separated by white space;
each field is converted to its atom value, and the 32-bit atom value is
transmitted instead of the atom name. For any other <em>format</em>, the
return value from <em>command</em> is divided into fields separated by
white space and each field is converted to a 32-bit integer; an array of
integers is transmitted to the selection requester. The <em>format</em>
argument is needed only for compatibility with many selection
requesters, except Tcl/Tk. If Tcl/Tk is being used to retrieve the
selection then the value is converted back to a string at the requesting
end, so <em>format</em> is irrelevant. A goal of the perl port is to
provide better handling of different formats than Tcl/Tk does, which
should be possible given perl's wider range of ``types''. Although some
thought went into this in very early days of perl/Tk what exactly
happens is still not quite right and subject to change.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;SelectionOwner?(-selection=&gt;selection)?</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>SelectionOwner</strong> returns the window in this
application that owns <em>selection</em> on the display containing
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, or an empty string if no window in this
application owns the selection. <em>Selection</em> defaults to
PRIMARY.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;SelectionOwn?(?-command=&gt;callback?,?-selection=&gt;selection?)?</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>SelectionOwn</strong> causes <em><code>$widget</code></em> to
become the new owner of <em>selection</em> on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display, returning an empty string as
result. The existing owner, if any, is notified that it has lost the
selection. If <em>callback</em> is specified, it will be executed when
some other window claims ownership of the selection away from
<em><code>$widget</code></em>. <em>Selection</em> defaults to
PRIMARY.</p>
