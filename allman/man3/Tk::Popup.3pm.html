<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Wm::Popup - popup dialog windows.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>$dialog-&gt;Popup(qw/ -popover =&gt; cursor | $widget | undef,
-overanchor =&gt; c | n | ne | e | se | s | sw | w | nw, -popanchor
=&gt; c | n | ne | e | se | s | sw | w | nw, /);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>You've probably had occasion to use a Dialog (or DialogBox) widget.
These widgets are derived from a Toplevel (which is a subclass of
Tk::Wm, the window manager) and spend most of their time in a withdrawn
state. It's also common to use Toplevels as containers for custom built
popup windows. Menus, too, are dialogs derived from the window manager
class. For this discussion, we'll use the simple term <em>dialog</em> to
refer any widget that pops up and awaits user interaction, whether it be
a Menu, a special purpose Toplevel, or any of the dialog-type widgets,
including, but not limited to, ColorEditor, Dialog, DialogBox,
ErrorDialog, FileSelect, FBox, getOpenFile and getSaveFile.</p>
<p>When it's time to display these dialogs, we call the Perl/Tk window
manager <strong>Popup</strong> method. <strong>Popup</strong> accepts
three special purpose options that specify placement information in
high-level terms rather than numerical coordinates. It is
<strong>Popup</strong>'s responsibility to take our human specifications
and turn them into actual screen coordinates before displaying the
dialog.</p>
<p>We can direct the dialog to appear in two general locations, either
over another window (e.g. the root window (screen) or a particular
widget), or over the cursor. This is called the <em>popover</em>
location. Once we've made this decision we can further refine the exact
placement of the dialog relative to the popover location by specifying
the intersection of two <em>anchor points</em>. The <em>popanchor</em>
point is associated with the dialog and the <em>overanchor point</em> is
associated with the popover location (whether it be a window or the
cursor). The point where the two anchor points coincide is the
<em>popup</em> locus. Anchor points are string values and can be
<em>c</em> (for center), or any of the eight cardinal compass points:
<em>n</em>, <em>ne</em>, <em>e</em>, <em>se</em>, <em>s</em>,
<em>sw</em>, <em>w</em> or <em>nw</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if <em>-popover</em> specifies a widget,
<em>-popanchor</em> is <em>sw</em>, and <em>-overanchor</em> is
<em>ne</em>, the the dialog's southwest corner pops up at the widget's
northeast corner.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The options recognized by <strong>Popup</strong> are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-popover</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether the dialog pops over a window or the cursor. It may
be the string <em>cursor</em>, a widget reference, or undef for the root
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-popanchor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the anchor point of the dialog. For instance, if <em>e</em>
is specified, the right side of the dialog is the anchor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-overanchor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies where the dialog should anchor relative to the popover
location. For instance, if <em>e</em> is specified the dialog appears
over the right side of the popover location and if it's <em>ne</em> the
the dialog is positioned at the upper-right corner of the popover
location.</p>
