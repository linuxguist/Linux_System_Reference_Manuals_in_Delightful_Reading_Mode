<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Font - Create and inspect fonts.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>    <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Font</strong>(<em>option</em>?,
<em>arg, arg, ...</em>?)</p>
<p>    <em><code>$font</code></em>-&gt;<em>Option</em>?(<em>arg, arg,
...</em>)?</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Font</strong> method provides several facilities for
dealing with fonts, such as defining named fonts and inspecting the
actual attributes of a font. The command has several different forms,
determined by the first argument. The following forms are currently
supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$font-&gt;actual(-option?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;fontActual(font?, -option?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Returns information about the actual attributes that are obtained
when <em>font</em> is used on <em><code>$font</code></em>'s display; the
actual attributes obtained may differ from the attributes requested due
to platform-dependant limitations, such as the availability of font
families and pointsizes. <em>font</em> is a font description; see FONT
DESCRIPTION below. If <em>option</em> is specified, returns the value of
that attribute; if it is omitted, the return value is a list of all the
attributes and their values. See FONT OPTIONS below for a list of the
possible attributes.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$font-&gt;configure(-option??=&gt;value, -option=&gt;value,
...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the desired attributes for
<em><code>$font</code></em>. If no <em>-option</em> is specified,
returns a list describing all the options and their values for
<em>fontname</em>. If a single <em>-option</em> is specified with no
<em>value</em>, then returns the current value of that attribute. If one
or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the method
modifies the given named font to have the given values; in this case,
all widgets using that font will redisplay themselves using the new
attributes for the font. See FONT OPTIONS below for a list of the
possible attributes. Note: the above behaviour differs in detail to
<strong>configure</strong> on widgets, images etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$font = $widget-&gt;Font(-option=&gt;value, ...&gt;?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$font = $widget-&gt;fontCreate(?fontname??, -option=&gt;value,
...&gt;?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Creates a new font object and returns a reference to it.
<em>fontname</em> specifies the name for the font; if it is omitted,
then Tk generates a new name of the form
<strong>font</strong><em>x</em>, where <em>x</em> is an integer. There
may be any number of <em>option-value</em> pairs, which provide the
desired attributes for the new named font. See FONT OPTIONS below for a
list of the possible attributes. Note: the created font is <em>not</em>
shared between widgets of different MainWindows.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$font-&gt;delete</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;fontDelete(fontname?, fontname, ...?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Delete the specified named fonts. If there are widgets using the
named font, the named font won't actually be deleted until all the
instances are released. Those widgets will continue to display using the
last known values for the named font. If a deleted named font is
subsequently recreated with another call to <strong>fontCreate</strong>,
the widgets will use the new named font and redisplay themselves using
the new attributes of that font.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;fontFamilies</dt>
<dd>
<p>The return value is a list of the case-insensitive names of all font
families that exist on <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$font-&gt;measure(text)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;fontMeasure(font, text)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Measures the amount of space the string <em>text</em> would use in
the given <em>font</em> when displayed in <em><code>$widget</code></em>.
<em>font</em> is a font description; see FONT DESCRIPTION below. The
return value is the total width in pixels of <em>text</em>, not
including the extra pixels used by highly exagerrated characters such as
cursive ``<em>f</em>''. If the string contains newlines or tabs, those
characters are not expanded or treated specially when measuring the
string.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$font-&gt;metrics(-option?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;fontMetrics(font?, -option?)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Returns information about the metrics (the font-specific data), for
<em>font</em> when it is used on <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s
display. <em>font</em> is a font description; see FONT DESCRIPTION
below. If <em>option</em> is specified, returns the value of that
metric; if it is omitted, the return value is a list of all the metrics
and their values. See FONT METRICS below for a list of the possible
metrics.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;fontNames</dt>
<dd>
<p>The return value is a list of all font objects that are currently
defined for <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s MainWindow.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FONT DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The following formats are accepted as a font description anywhere
<em>font</em> is specified as an argument above; these same forms are
also permitted when specifying the <strong>-font</strong> option for
widgets.</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1] fontname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of a named font, created using the
<strong>fontCreate</strong> method. When a widget uses a named font, it
is guaranteed that this will never cause an error, as long as the named
font exists, no matter what potentially invalid or meaningless set of
attributes the named font has. If the named font cannot be displayed
with exactly the specified attributes, some other close font will be
substituted automatically.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[1a] $font</dt>
<dd>
<p>A font object created using the <strong>Font</strong> method. This is
essentially the same as using a named font. The object is a reference to
the name, and carries additional information e.g. which MainWindow it
relates to in an manner peculiar to perl/Tk.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2] systemfont</dt>
<dd>
<p>The platform-specific name of a font, interpreted by the graphics
server. This also includes, under X, an XLFD (see [4]) for which a
single ``<strong>*</strong>'' character was used to elide more than one
field in the middle of the name. See PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ISSUES for a list
of the system fonts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3] [family,?size,??style,??style ...?]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A properly formed list whose first element is the desired font
<em>family</em> and whose optional second element is the desired
<em>size</em>. The interpretation of the <em>size</em> attribute follows
the same rules described for -size in FONT OPTIONS below. Any additional
optional arguments following the <em>size</em> are font <em>style</em>s.
Possible values for the <em>style</em> arguments are as follows: normal
bold roman italic underline overstrike</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4] X-font names (XLFD)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A Unix-centric font name of the form
<em>-foundry-family-weight-slant-setwidth-addstyle-pixel-point-resx-resy-spacing-width-charset-encoding</em>.
The ``<strong>*</strong>'' character may be used to skip individual
fields that the user does not care about. There must be exactly one
``<strong>*</strong>'' for each field skipped, except that a
``<strong>*</strong>'' at the end of the XLFD skips any remaining
fields; the shortest valid XLFD is simply ``<strong>*</strong>'',
signifying all fields as defaults. Any fields that were skipped are
given default values. For compatibility, an XLFD always chooses a font
of the specified pixel size (not point size); although this
interpretation is not strictly correct, all existing applications using
XLFDs assumed that one ``point'' was in fact one pixel and would display
incorrectly (generally larger) if the correct size font were actually
used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5] option value ?option value ...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>A properly formed list of <em>option-value</em> pairs that specify
the desired attributes of the font, in the same format used when
defining a named font; see FONT OPTIONS below.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When font description <em>font</em> is used, the system attempts to
parse the description according to each of the above five rules, in the
order specified. Cases [1] and [2] must match the name of an existing
named font or of a system font. Cases [3], [4], and [5] are accepted on
all platforms and the closest available font will be used. In some
situations it may not be possible to find any close font (e.g., the font
family was a garbage value); in that case, some system-dependant default
font is chosen. If the font description does not match any of the above
patterns, an error is generated.</p>
<h1>FONT METRICS</h1>
<p>The following options are used by the
<strong>metrics</strong>/<strong>fontMetrics</strong> method to query
font-specific data determined when the font was created. These
properties are for the whole font itself and not for individual
characters drawn in that font. In the following definitions, the
``baseline'' of a font is the horizontal line where the bottom of most
letters line up; certain letters, such as lower-case ``g'' stick below
the baseline.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-ascent</dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount in pixels that the tallest letter sticks up above the
baseline of the font, plus any extra blank space added by the designer
of the font. (<em><code>$font</code></em>-&gt;<strong>ascent</strong> is
provided for compatibility.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>-descent</dt>
<dd>
<p>The largest amount in pixels that any letter sticks down below the
baseline of the font, plus any extra blank space added by the designer
of the font. (<em><code>$font</code></em>-&gt;<strong>descent</strong>
is provided for compatibility.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>-linespace</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns how far apart vertically in pixels two lines of text using
the same font should be placed so that none of the characters in one
line overlap any of the characters in the other line. This is generally
the sum of the ascent above the baseline line plus the descent below the
baseline.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-fixed</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a boolean flag that is ``<strong>1</strong>'' if this is a
fixed-width font, where each normal character is the the same width as
all the other characters, or is ``<strong>0</strong>'' if this is a
proportionally-spaced font, where individual characters have different
widths. The widths of control characters, tab characters, and other
non-printing characters are not included when calculating this
value.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FONT OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are supported on all platforms, and are used
when constructing a named font or when specifying a font using style [5]
as above:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-family =&gt; name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The case-insensitive font family name. Tk guarantees to support the
font families named <strong>Courier</strong> (a monospaced
``typewriter'' font), <strong>Times</strong> (a serifed ``newspaper''
font), and <strong>Helvetica</strong> (a sans-serif ``European'' font).
The most closely matching native font family will automatically be
substituted when one of the above font families is used. The
<em>name</em> may also be the name of a native, platform-specific font
family; in that case it will work as desired on one platform but may not
display correctly on other platforms. If the family is unspecified or
unrecognized, a platform-specific default font will be chosen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-size =&gt; size</dt>
<dd>
<p>The desired size of the font. If the <em>size</em> argument is a
positive number, it is interpreted as a size in points. If <em>size</em>
is a negative number, its absolute value is interpreted as a size in
pixels. If a font cannot be displayed at the specified size, a nearby
size will be chosen. If <em>size</em> is unspecified or zero, a
platform-dependent default size will be chosen. The original Tcl/Tk
authors believe sizes should normally be specified in points so the
application will remain the same ruler size on the screen, even when
changing screen resolutions or moving scripts across platforms. While
this is an admirable goal it does not work as well in practice as they
hoped. The mapping between points and pixels is set when the application
starts, based on alleged properties of the installed monitor, but it can
be overridden by calling the scaling command. However this can be
problematic when system has no way of telling if (say) an 11 or 22
monitor is attached, also if it <em>can</em> tell then some monitor
sizes may result in poorer quality scaled fonts being used rather than a
tuned bitmap font. In addition specifying pixels is useful in certain
circumstances such as when a piece of text must line up with respect to
a fixed-size bitmap. At present the Tcl/Tk scheme is used unchanged,
with point size being returned by <em>actual</em> (as an integer), and
used internally. Suggestions for work-rounds to undesirable behaviour
welcome.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-weight =&gt; weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>The nominal thickness of the characters in the font. The value
<strong>normal</strong> specifies a normal weight font, while
<strong>bold</strong> specifies a bold font. The closest available
weight to the one specified will be chosen. The default weight is
<strong>normal</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-slant =&gt; slant</dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount the characters in the font are slanted away from the
vertical. Valid values for slant are <strong>roman</strong> and
<strong>italic</strong>. A roman font is the normal, upright appearance
of a font, while an italic font is one that is tilted some number of
degrees from upright. The closest available slant to the one specified
will be chosen. The default slant is <strong>roman</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-underline =&gt; boolean</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value is a boolean flag that specifies whether characters in this
font should be underlined. The default value for underline is
<strong>false</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-overstrike =&gt; boolean</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value is a boolean flag that specifies whether a horizontal line
should be drawn through the middle of characters in this font. The
default value for overstrike is <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ISSUES</h1>

<h1>COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS</h1>
<p>In prior versions of perl/Tk the
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>Font</strong> method was a
perl wrapper on the original [4] X-font names (XLFD) style as described
above (which was the only form supported by versions of core tk prior to
version tk8.0). This module is provided in its original form (it has
just been renamed) via:</p>
<p>use Tk::X11Font;
I&lt;$widget&gt;-E&lt;gt&gt;B&lt;X11Font&gt;(...)</p>
<p>However the methods of the old scheme have been mimiced as closely as
possible with the new scheme. It is intended that code should work
without modification, except for the case of using :</p>
<p>@names = $font-&gt;Name;</p>
<p>i.e. the <em>Name</em> method in an array/list context. This now
returns one element on all platforms (as it did on Win32), while
previously on X systems it returned a list of fonts that matched an
under-specified pattern.</p>
<p>Briefly the methods supported for compatibility are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$newfont = $font-&gt;Clone(-option=&gt;value, ...&gt;?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new font object <em><code>$newfont</code></em> related to
the original <em><code>$font</code></em> by changing the values of the
specified <em>-option</em>s.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$font-&gt;Family - maps to -family</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$font-&gt;Weight - maps to -weight</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>$font-&gt;Slant - maps to -slant</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>$font-&gt;Pixel and Point - map to -size</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>New code should use
<em><code>$font</code></em>-&gt;<strong>configure</strong> to achieve
same effect as last four items above.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Foundry, Swidth, Adstyle, Xres, Yres, Space, Avgwidth, Registry,
Encoding</dt>
<dd>
<p>Are all ignored if set, and return '*' if queried.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$font-&gt;Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of a named font, or a string representation of an
unnamed font. Using <em><code>$font</code></em> in a scalar context does
the same. Note this is distinctly different from behaviour of X11Font's
Name in a list context.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$font-&gt;Pattern</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a XLFD string for the font based on <em>actual</em> values,
and some heuristics to map Tk's forms to the standard X conventions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
