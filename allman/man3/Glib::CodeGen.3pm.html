<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::CodeGen - code generation utilities for Glib-based
bindings.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p># usually in Makefile.PL use Glib::CodeGen; # most common, use all
defaults Glib::CodeGen-&gt;parse_maps (myprefix);
Glib::CodeGen-&gt;write_boot; # more exotic, change everything
Glib::CodeGen-&gt;parse_maps (foo, input =&gt; foo.maps, header =&gt;
foo-autogen.h, typemap =&gt; foo.typemap, register =&gt;
register-foo.xsh); Glib::CodeGen-&gt;write_boot (filename =&gt;
bootfoo.xsh, glob =&gt; Foo*.xs, ignore =&gt; ^(Foo|Foo::Bar)$); # add a
custom type handler (rarely necessary)
Glib::CodeGen-&gt;add_type_handler (FooType =&gt; \&amp;gen_foo_stuff);
# (see the section EXTENDING TYPE SUPPORT for more info.)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module packages some of the boilerplate code needed for
performing code generation typically used by perl bindings for
gobject-based libraries, using the Glib module as a base.</p>
<p>The default output filenames are in the subdirectory 'build', which
usually will be present if you are using ExtUtils::Depends (as most
Glib-based extensions probably should).</p>

<p>Many GObject-based libraries to be bound to perl will be too large to
put in a single XS file; however, a single PM file typically only
bootstraps one XS file's code. <code>write_boot</code> generates an XSH
file to be included from the BOOT section of that one bootstrapped
module, calling the boot code for all the other XS files in the project.
Options are passed to the function in a set of key/val pairs, and all
options may default. filename the name of the output file to be created.
the default is build/boot.xsh. glob a glob pattern that specifies the
names of the xs files to scan for MODULE lines. the default is xs/*.xs.
xs_files use this to supply an explicit list of file names (as an array
reference) to use instead of a glob pattern. the default is to use the
glob pattern. ignore regular expression matching any and all module
names which should be ignored, i.e. NOT included in the list of symbols
to boot. this parameter is extremely important for avoiding infinite
loops at startup; see the discussion for an explanation and rationale.
the default is ^[^:]+$, or, any name that contains no colons, i.e., any
toplevel package name. This function performs a glob (using perl's
builtin glob operator) on the pattern specified by the 'glob' option to
retrieve a list of file names. It then scans each file in that list for
lines matching the pattern ^MODULE Î©- that is, the MODULE directive in
an XS file. The module name is pulled out and matched against the
regular expression specified by the ignore parameter. If this module is
not to be ignored, we next check to see if the name has been seen. If
not, the name will be converted to a boot symbol (basically, s/:/_/ and
prepend boot_) and this symbol will be added to a call to
GPERL_CALL_BOOT in the generated file; it is then marked as seen so we
don't call it again. What is this all about, you ask? In order to bind
an XSub to perl, the C function must be registered with the interpreter.
This is the function of the boot code, which is typically called in the
bootstrapping process. However, when multiple XS files are used with
only one PM file, some other mechanism must call the boot code from each
XS file before any of the function therein will be available. A typical
setup for a multiple-XS, single-PM module will be to call the various
bits of boot code from the BOOT: section of the toplevel module's XS
file. To use Gtk2 as an example, when you do 'use Gtk2', Gtk2.pm calls
bootstrap on Gtk2, which calls the C function boot_Gtk2. This function
calls the boot symbols for all the other xs files in the module. The
distinction is that the toplevel module, Gtk2, has no colons in its
name. <code>xsubpp</code> generates the boot function's name by
replacing the colons in the MODULE name with underscores and prepending
boot_. We need to be careful not to include the boot code for the
bootstrapped module, (say Toplevel, or Gtk2, or whatever) because the
bootstrap code in Toplevel.pm will call boot_Toplevel when loaded, and
boot_Toplevel should actually include the file we are creating here. The
default value for the ignore parameter ignores any name not containing
colons, because it is assumed that this will be a toplevel module, and
any other packages/modules it boots will be <em>below</em> this
namespace, i.e., they will contain colons. This assumption holds true
for Gtk2 and Gnome2, but obviously fails for something like
Gnome2::Canvas. To boot that module properly, you must use a regular
expression such as ^Gnome2::Canvas$. Note that you can, of course, match
more than just one name, e.g. ^(Foo|Foo::Bar)$, if you wanted to have
Foo::Bar be included in the same dynamically loaded object but only be
booted when absolutely necessary. (If you get that to work, more power
to you.) Also, since this code scans for ^MODULE, you must comment the
MODULE section out with leading # marks if you want to hide it from
<code>write_boot</code>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Glib::CodeGen-&gt;parse_maps (PREFIX, [KEY =&gt; VAL, ...])</dt>
<dd>
<p>Convention within Glib/Gtk2 and friends is to use preprocessor macros
in the style of SvMyType and newSVMyType to get values in and out of
perl, and to use those same macros from both hand-written code as well
as the typemaps. However, if you have a lot of types in your library
(such as the nearly 200 types in Gtk+ 2.x), then writing those macros
becomes incredibly tedious, especially so when you factor in all of the
variants and such. So, this function can turn a flat file containing
terse descriptions of the types into a header containing all the cast
macros, a typemap file using them, and an XSH file containing the proper
code to register each of those types (to be included by your module's
BOOT code). The <em>PREFIX</em> is mandatory, and is used in some of the
resulting filenames, You can also override the defaults by providing
key=&gt;val pairs: input input file name. default is maps. if this keys
value is an array reference, all the filenames in the array will be
scanned. header name of the header file to create, default is
build/$prefix-autogen.h typemap name of the typemap file to create,
default is build/$prefix.typemap register name of the xsh file to
contain all of the type registrations, default is build/register.xsh the
maps file is a table of type descriptions, one per line, with fields
separated by whitespace. the fields should be: TYPE macro e.g.,
GTK_TYPE_WIDGET class name e.g. GtkWidget, name of the C type base type
one of GObject, GBoxed, GEnum, GFlags. To support other base types, see
EXTENDING TYPE SUPPORT for info on on how to add a custom type handler.
package name of the perl package to which this class name should be
mapped, e.g. Gtk2::Widget As a special case, you can also use this same
format to register error domains; in this case two of the four columns
take on slightly different meanings: domain macro e.g., GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR
enum type macro e.g., GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF_ERROR base type GError package
name of the Perl package to which this class name should be mapped,
e.g., Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf::Error.</p>

<h1>EXTENDING TYPE SUPPORT</h1>
<p><code>parse_maps</code> uses the base type entry in each maps record
to decide how to generate output for that type. In the base module, type
support is included for the base types provided by Glib. It is easy to
add support for your own types, by merely adding a type handler. This
type handler will call utility functions to add typemaps, BOOT lines,
and header lines.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Glib::CodeGen-&gt;add_type_handler ($base_type =&gt; $handler)</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>$base_type (string) C name of the base type to handle.</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>$handler (subroutine) Callback used to handle this type.</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Use <em><code>$handler</code></em> to generate output for records
whose base type is <em><code>$base_type</code></em>.
<em><code>$base_type</code></em> is the C type name as found in the
third column of a maps file entry. <em><code>$handler</code></em> will
be called with the (possibly preprocessed) contents of the current maps
file record, and should call the <code>add_typemap</code>,
<code>add_register</code>, and <code>add_header</code> functions to set
up the necessary C/XS glue for that type. For example:
Glib::CodeGen-&gt;add_type_handler (CoolThing =&gt; sub { my
($typemacro, $classname, $base, $package) = @_; # $typemacro is the C
type macro, like COOL_TYPE_THING. # $classname is the actual C type
name, like CoolFooThing. # $base is the C name of the base type. If
CoolFooThing # isa CoolThing, $base will be CoolThing. This # parameter
is useful when using the same type handler # for multiple base types. #
$package is the package name that corresponds to # $classname, as
specified in the maps file. ... });</p>
</dd>
<dt>add_typemap $type, $typemap [, $input, $output]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add a typemap entry for <code>$type</code>, named
<code>$typemap</code>. If <em><code>$input</code></em> and/or
<em><code>$output</code></em> are defined, their text will be used as
the <code>INPUT</code> and/or <code>OUTPUT</code> typemap
implementations (respectively) for <em><code>$typemap</code></em>. Note
that in general, you'll use <code>T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER</code> or some
other existing typemap for <em><code>$typemap</code></em>, so
<em><code>$input</code></em> and <em><code>$output</code></em> are very
rarely used. Example: # map $classname pointers and all their variants
to the generic # wrapper typemap. add_typemap "$classname *",
"T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER"; add_typemap "const $classname *",
"T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER"; add_typemap "$classname\_ornull *",
"T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER"; add_typemap "const $classname\_ornull *",
"T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER"; add_typemap "$classname\_own *",
"T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER"; add_typemap "$classname\_copy *",
"T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER"; add_typemap "$classname\_own_ornull *",
"T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER"; # custom code for an int-like enum:
add_typemap $class =&gt; T_FOO, "\$var = foo_unwrap (\$arg);", # input
"\$arg = foo_wrap (\$var);"; # output</p>
</dd>
<dt>add_register $text</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add <em><code>$text</code></em> to the generated
<code>register.xsh</code>. This is usually used for registering types
with the bindings, e.g.: add_register "#ifdef $typemacro\n" .
"gperl_register_object ($typemacro, \"$package\");\n" . "#endif /*
$typemacro */";</p>
</dd>
<dt>add_header $text</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add <em><code>$text</code></em> to the generated C header. You'll put
variant typedefs and wrap/unwrap macros in the header, and will usually
want to wrap the declarations in <code>#ifdef $typemacro</code> for
safety.</p>
