<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::grab - Confine pointer and keyboard events to a window
sub-tree</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>grab</strong></p>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>grab</strong><em>Option</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This set of methods implement simple pointer and keyboard grabs for
Tk. Tk's grabs are different than the grabs described in the Xlib
documentation. When a grab is set for a particular window, Tk restricts
all pointer events to the grab window and its descendants in Tk's window
hierarchy. Whenever the pointer is within the grab window's subtree, the
pointer will behave exactly the same as if there had been no grab at all
and all events will be reported in the normal fashion. When the pointer
is outside <em><code>$widget</code></em>'s tree, button presses and
releases and mouse motion events are reported to
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, and window entry and window exit events
are ignored. The grab subtree ``owns'' the pointer: windows outside the
grab subtree will be visible on the screen but they will be insensitive
until the grab is released. The tree of windows underneath the grab
window can include top-level windows, in which case all of those
top-level windows and their descendants will continue to receive mouse
events during the grab.</p>
<p>Two forms of grabs are possible: local and global. A local grab
affects only the grabbing application: events will be reported to other
applications as if the grab had never occurred. Grabs are local by
default. A global grab locks out all applications on the screen, so that
only the given subtree of the grabbing application will be sensitive to
pointer events (mouse button presses, mouse button releases, pointer
motions, window entries, and window exits). During global grabs the
window manager will not receive pointer events either.</p>
<p>During local grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key releases)
are delivered as usual: the window manager controls which application
receives keyboard events, and if they are sent to any window in the
grabbing application then they are redirected to the focus window.
During a global grab Tk grabs the keyboard so that all keyboard events
are always sent to the grabbing application. The <strong>focus</strong>
method is still used to determine which window in the application
receives the keyboard events. The keyboard grab is released when the
grab is released.</p>
<p>Grabs apply to particular displays. If an application has windows on
multiple displays then it can establish a separate grab on each display.
The grab on a particular display affects only the windows on that
display. It is possible for different applications on a single display
to have simultaneous local grabs, but only one application can have a
global grab on a given display at once.</p>
<p>The <strong>grab</strong> methods take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;grabCurrent</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current grab window in this application for
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display, or an empty string if there is
no such window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;grabs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list whose elements are all of the windows grabbed by this
application for all displays, or an empty string if the application has
no grabs. <em>Not implemented yet!</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;grabRelease</dt>
<dd>
<p>Releases the grab on <em><code>$widget</code></em> if there is one,
otherwise does nothing. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;grab</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets a local grab on <em><code>$widget</code></em>. If a grab was
already in effect for this application on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display then it is automatically
released. If there is already a local grab on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, then the command does nothing. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;grabGlobal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets a global grab on <em><code>$widget</code></em>. If a grab was
already in effect for this application on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>'s display then it is automatically
released. If there is already a global grab on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, then the command does nothing. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;grabStatus</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>none</strong> if no grab is currently set on
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, <strong>local</strong> if a local grab is
set on <em><code>$widget</code></em>, and <strong>global</strong> if a
global grab is set.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>It took an incredibly complex and gross implementation to produce the
simple grab effect described above. Given the current implementation, it
isn't safe for applications to use the Xlib grab facilities at all
except through the Tk grab procedures. If applications try to manipulate
X's grab mechanisms directly, things will probably break.</p>
<p>If a single process is managing several different Tk applications,
only one of those applications can have a local grab for a given display
at any given time. If the applications are in different processes, this
restriction doesn't exist.</p>
