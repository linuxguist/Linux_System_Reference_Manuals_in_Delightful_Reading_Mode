<p>Specifies a script to eval when <strong>validateCommand</strong>
returns 0. Setting it to &lt;undef&gt; disables this feature (the
default). The best use of this option is to set it to <em>bell</em>. See
<strong>Validation</strong> below for more information.</p>

<p>If this option is specified, then the true contents of the entry are
not displayed in the window. Instead, each character in the entry's
value will be displayed as the first character in the value of this
option, such as ``*''. This is useful, for example, if the entry is to
be used to enter a password. If characters in the entry are selected and
copied elsewhere, the information copied will be what is displayed, not
the true contents of the entry.</p>

</dl>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the entry: <strong>normal</strong>,
<strong>disabled</strong>, or <strong>readonly</strong>. If the entry is
<strong>readonly</strong>, then the value may not be changed using
widget commands and no insertion cursor will be displayed, even if the
input focus is in the widget; the contents of the widget may still be
selected. If the entry is <strong>disabled</strong>, the value may not
be changed, no insertion cursor will be displayed, the contents will not
be selectable, and the entry may be displayed in a different color,
depending on the values of the <strong>-disabledforeground</strong> and
<strong>-disabledbackground</strong> options.</p>

<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a script to eval when you want to validate the input into
the entry widget. Setting it to <code>undef</code> disables this feature
(the default). This command must return a valid boolean value. If it
returns 0 (or the valid boolean equivalent) then it means you reject the
new edition and it will not occur and the
<strong>invalidCommand</strong> will be evaluated if it is set. If it
returns 1, then the new edition occurs. See <strong>Validation</strong>
below for more information.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies an integer value indicating the desired width of the entry
window, in average-size characters of the widget's font. If the value is
less than or equal to zero, the widget picks a size just large enough to
hold its current text.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Entry</strong> method creates a new window (given by the
<code>$entry</code> argument) and makes it into an entry widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the entry such as
its colors, font, and relief. The <strong>entry</strong> command returns
its <code>$entry</code> argument. At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named <code>$entry</code>, but
<code>$entry</code>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>An entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and allows
that string to be edited using methods described below, which are
typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions. When first created, an
entry's string is empty. A portion of the entry may be selected as
described below. If an entry is exporting its selection (see the
<strong>exportSelection</strong> option), then it will observe the
standard X11 protocols for handling the selection; entry selections are
available as type <strong>STRING</strong>. Entries also observe the
standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus. When an entry has
the input focus it displays an <em>insertion cursor</em> to indicate
where new characters will be inserted.</p>
<p>Entries are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit
entirely within the widget's window. In this case, only a portion of the
string will be displayed; methods described below may be used to change
the view in the window. Entries use the standard
<strong>xScrollCommand</strong> mechanism for interacting with
scrollbars (see the description of the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong>
option for details). They also support scanning, as described below.</p>
<h1>VALIDATION</h1>
<p>Validation of entry widgets is derived from part of the patch written
by jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu. This works by setting the
<strong>validateCommand</strong> option to a callback which will be
evaluated according to the <strong>validate</strong> option as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>
<p>Default. This means no validation will occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focus</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the entry
receives or loses focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusin</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the entry
receives focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusout</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the entry loses
focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>key</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called when the entry is
edited.</p>
</dd>
<dt>all</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>validateCommand</strong> will be called for all above
conditions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>validateCommand</strong> and
<strong>invalidCommand</strong> are called with the following
arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The proposed value of the entry. If you are configuring the entry
widget to have a new textvariable, this will be the value of that
textvariable.</p></li>
<li><p>The characters to be added (or deleted). This will be
<code>undef</code> if validation is due to focus, explcit call to
validate or if change is due to <code>-textvariable</code>
changing.</p></li>
<li><p>The current value of entry i.e. before the proposed
change.</p></li>
<li><p>index of char string to be added/deleted, if any. -1
otherwise</p></li>
<li><p>type of action. 1 == INSERT, 0 == DELETE, -1 if it's a forced
validation or textvariable validation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the <strong>textVariable</strong> and
<strong>validateCommand</strong> can be dangerous to mix. If you try set
the <strong>textVariable</strong> to something that the
<strong>validateCommand</strong> will not accept it will be set back to
the value of the entry widget. Using the <strong>textVariable</strong>
for read-only purposes will never cause problems.</p>
<p>The <strong>validateCommand</strong> will turn itself off by setting
<strong>validate</strong> to <strong>none</strong> when an error occurs,
for example when the <strong>validateCommand</strong> or
<strong>invalidCommand</strong> encounters an error in its script while
evaluating, or <strong>validateCommand</strong> does not return a valid
boolean value.</p>
<p>With the perl/Tk version <strong>validate</strong> option is supposed
to be suspended while executing the <strong>validateCommand</strong> or
the <strong>invalidCommand</strong>. This is experimental but in theory
either callback can correct the value of the widget, and override the
proposed change. (<strong>validateCommand</strong> should still return
false to inhibit the change from happening when it returns.)</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Entry</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>Many of the additional methods for entries take one or more indices
as arguments. An index specifies a particular character in the entry's
string, in any of the following ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to
the first character in the string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>anchor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
<strong>selectionFrom</strong> and <strong>selectionAdjust</strong>
methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt>end</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the entry's
string. This is equivalent to specifying a numerical index equal to the
length of the entry's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>insert</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the
insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sel.first</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the first character in the selection. It is an error to use
this form if the selection isn't in the entry window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sel.last</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection. It
is an error to use this form if the selection isn't in the entry
window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li><p>In this form, <em>number</em> is treated as an x-coordinate in
the entry's window; the character spanning that x-coordinate is used.
For example, ``<strong><code>@0</code></strong>'' indicates the
left-most character in the window.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g.
``<strong>e</strong>'' or ``<strong>sel.f</strong>''. In general,
out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest legal
value.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for entry widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;bbox(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
character given by <em>index</em>. The first two elements of the list
give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen area
covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last
two elements give the width and height of the character, in pixels. The
bounding box may refer to a region outside the visible area of the
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;cget(?option?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>entry</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;configure(?option?, ?value, option, value, ...?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <code>$entry</code> (see Tk::configure for
information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If
one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this
case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any
of the values accepted by the <strong>entry</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;delete(first, ?last?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delete one or more elements of the entry. <em>First</em> is the index
of the first character to delete, and <em>last</em> is the index of the
character just after the last one to delete. If <em>last</em> isn't
specified it defaults to <em>first</em>+1, i.e. a single character is
deleted. This method returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;get</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the entry's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;icursor(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the
character given by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;index(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the numerical index corresponding to <em>index</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;insert(index, string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the characters of <em>string</em> just before the character
indicated by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;scan(option, args)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;scanOption(args)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This method is used to implement scanning on entries. It has two
forms, depending on <em>Option</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;scanMark(x)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Records <em>x</em> and the current view in the entry widget; used in
conjunction with later <strong>scanDragto</strong> methods. Typically
this method is associated with a mouse button press in the widget. It
returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;scanDragto(x)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method computes the difference between its <em>x</em> argument
and the <em>x</em> argument to the last <strong>scanMark</strong> method
for the widget. It then adjusts the view left or right by 10 times the
difference in x-coordinates. This method is typically associated with
mouse motion events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the
entry at high speed through the widget. The return value is an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selection(option, arg)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selectionOption(arg)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This method is used to adjust the selection within an entry. It has
several forms, depending on <em>Option</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selectionAdjust(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character given by
<em>index</em>, and adjust that end of the selection to be at
<em>index</em> (i.e including but not going beyond <em>index</em>). The
other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future
<strong>selectionTo</strong> methods. If the selection isn't currently
in the entry, then a new selection is created to include the characters
between <em>index</em> and the most recent selection anchor point,
inclusive. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selectionClear</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget. If the
selection isn't in this widget then the method has no effect. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selectionFrom(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the selection anchor point to just before the character given by
<em>index</em>. Doesn't change the selection. Returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selectionPresent</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the entry, 0 if
nothing is selected.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selectionRange(start, end)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the one
indexed by <em>start</em> and ending with the one just before
<em>end</em>. If <em>end</em> refers to the same character as
<em>start</em> or an earlier one, then the entry's selection is
cleared.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;selectionTo(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>index</em> is before the anchor point, set the selection to
the characters from <em>index</em> up to but not including the anchor
point. If <em>index</em> is the same as the anchor point, do nothing. If
<em>index</em> is after the anchor point, set the selection to the
characters from the anchor point up to but not including <em>index</em>.
The anchor point is determined by the most recent
<strong>selectionFrom</strong> or <strong>selectionAdjust</strong>
method in this widget. If the selection isn't in this widget then a new
selection is created using the most recent anchor point specified for
the widget. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;validate</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to force an evaluation of the
<strong>validateCommand</strong> independent of the conditions specified
by the <strong>validate</strong> option. It returns 0 or 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;xview(args)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
the text in the widget's window. It can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$entry-&gt;xview</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal span
that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2
and the second element is .7, 20% of the entry's text is off-screen to
the left, the middle 50% is visible in the window, and 30% of the text
is off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to
scrollbars via the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;xview(index)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by
<em>index</em> is displayed at the left edge of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;xviewMoveto(fraction)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character
<em>fraction</em> of the way through the text appears at the left edge
of the window. <em>Fraction</em> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$entry-&gt;xviewScroll(number, what)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method shifts the view in the window left or right according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right
by <em>number</em> average-width characters on the display; if it is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by <em>number</em>
screenfuls. If <em>number</em> is negative then characters farther to
the left become visible; if it is positive then characters farther to
the right become visible.</p>

<h1>DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for entries that give them
the following default behavior. In the descriptions below, ``word''
refers to a contiguous group of letters, digits, or ``_'' characters, or
any single character other than these.</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before
the character underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this
widget, and clears any selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse
button 1 strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the
character under the mouse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse
and positions the insertion cursor at the beginning of the word.
Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection consisting of
whole words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the
entry and positions the insertion cursor before the first character.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse
button 1 while the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of the
selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was
pressed. If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the
selection will be adjusted in units of whole words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position the
insertion cursor in the entry without affecting the selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If any normal printing characters are typed in an entry, they are
inserted at the point of the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The view in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button
2. If mouse button 2 is clicked without moving the mouse, the selection
is copied into the entry at the position of the mouse cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[8]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the mouse is dragged out of the entry on the left or right sides
while button 1 is pressed, the entry will automatically scroll to make
more text visible (if there is more text off-screen on the side where
the mouse left the window).</p>
</dd>
<dt>[9]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to
the left or right; they also clear any selection in the entry and set
the selection anchor. If Left or Right is typed with the Shift key down,
then the insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include
the new character. Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion
cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the
insertion cursor by words and also extend the selection. Control-b and
Control-f behave the same as Left and Right, respectively. Meta-b and
Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control-Right,
respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[10]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to the
beginning of the entry and clear any selection in the entry. Shift-Home
moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the entry and also
extends the selection to that point.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[11]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the end
of the entry and clear any selection in the entry. Shift-End moves the
cursor to the end and extends the selection to that point.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[12]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the
position of the insertion cursor. They don't affect the current
selection. Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection to
the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor
to the insertion cursor if there was not any selection previously.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[13]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-/ selects all the text in the entry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[14]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-\ clears any selection in the entry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[15]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies
the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a
selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[16]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w
copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the
selection. If there is no selection in the widget then these keys have
no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[17]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations) or Control-y
inserts the contents of the clipboard at the position of the insertion
cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[18]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the entry.
If there is no selection, it deletes the character to the right of the
insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[19]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is one
in the entry. If there is no selection, it deletes the character to the
left of the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[20]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion
cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[21]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[22]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion
cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[23]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of
the insertion cursor. If the entry is disabled using the
<strong>-state</strong> option, then the entry's view can still be
adjusted and text in the entry can still be selected, but no insertion
cursor will be displayed and no text modifications will take place. The
behavior of entries can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
