<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>intro - introduction to library functions</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Section 3 of the manual describes all library functions excluding the
library functions (system call wrappers) described in Section 2, which
implement system calls.</p>
<p>Many of the functions described in the section are part of the
Standard C Library (<em>libc</em>). Some functions are part of other
libraries (e.g., the math library, <em>libm</em>, or the real-time
library, <em>librt</em>) in which case the manual page will indicate the
linker option needed to link against the required library (e.g.,
<em>-lm</em> and <em>-lrt</em>, respectively, for the aforementioned
libraries).</p>
<p>In some cases, the programmer must define a feature test macro in
order to obtain the declaration of a function from the header file
specified in the man page SYNOPSIS section. (Where required, these
<em>feature test macros</em> must be defined before including
<em>any</em> header files.) In such cases, the required macro is
described in the man page. For further information on feature test
macros, see <strong>feature_test_macros</strong>(7).</p>
<h2>Subsections</h2>
<p>Section 3 of this manual is organized into subsections that reflect
the complex structure of the standard C library and its many
implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3const</p></li>
<li><p>3head</p></li>
<li><p>3type</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This difficult history frequently makes it a poor example to follow
in design, implementation, and presentation.</p>
<p>Ideally, a library for the C language is designed such that each
header file presents the interface to a coherent software module. It
provides a small number of function declarations and exposes only data
types and constants that are required for use of those functions.
Together, these are termed an API or <em>application program
interface</em>. Types and constants to be shared among multiple APIs
should be placed in header files that declare no functions. This
organization permits a C library module to be documented concisely with
one header file per manual page. Such an approach improves the
readability and accessibility of library documentation, and thereby the
usability of the software.</p>
<h1>STANDARDS</h1>
<p>Certain terms and abbreviations are used to indicate UNIX variants
and standards to which calls in this section conform. See
<strong>standards</strong>(7).</p>
