<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>LWP::RobotUA - a class for well-behaved Web robots</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use LWP::RobotUA; my $ua = LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new(my-robot/0.1,
me@foo.com); $ua-&gt;delay(10); # be very nice -- max one hit every ten
minutes! ... # Then just use it just like a normal LWP::UserAgent: my
$response = $ua-&gt;get(http://whatever.int/...); ...</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This class implements a user agent that is suitable for robot
applications. Robots should be nice to the servers they visit. They
should consult the <em>/robots.txt</em> file to ensure that they are
welcomed and they should not make requests too frequently.</p>
<p>But before you consider writing a robot, take a look at
&lt;http://www.robotstxt.org/&gt;.</p>
<p>When you use an <em>LWP::RobotUA</em> object as your user agent, then
you do not really have to think about these things yourself;
<code>robots.txt</code> files are automatically consulted and obeyed,
the server isn't queried too rapidly, and so on. Just send requests as
you do when you are using a normal <em>LWP::UserAgent</em> object (using
<code>$ua-&gt;get(...)</code>, <code>$ua-&gt;head(...)</code>,
<code>$ua-&gt;request(...)</code>, etc.), and this special agent will
make sure you are nice.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>The LWP::RobotUA is a sub-class of LWP::UserAgent and implements the
same methods. In addition the following methods are provided:</p>
<h2>new</h2>
<p>my $ua = LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new( %options ) my $ua =
LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new( $agent, $from ) my $ua = LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new(
$agent, $from, $rules )</p>
<p>The LWP::UserAgent options <code>agent</code> and <code>from</code>
are mandatory. The options <code>delay</code>, <code>use_sleep</code>
and <code>rules</code> initialize attributes private to the RobotUA. If
<code>rules</code> are not provided, then WWW::RobotRules is
instantiated providing an internal database of <em>robots.txt</em>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to just pass the value of <code>agent</code>,
<code>from</code> and optionally <code>rules</code> as plain positional
arguments.</p>
<h2>delay</h2>
<p>my $delay = $ua-&gt;delay; $ua-&gt;delay( $minutes );</p>
<p>Get/set the minimum delay between requests to the same server, in
<em>minutes</em>. The default is <code>1</code> minute. Note that this
number doesn't have to be an integer; for example, this sets the delay
to <code>10</code> seconds:</p>
<p>$ua-&gt;delay(10/60);</p>
<h2>use_sleep</h2>
<p>my $bool = $ua-&gt;use_sleep; $ua-&gt;use_sleep( $boolean );</p>
<p>Get/set a value indicating whether the UA should sleep in
LWP::RobotUA if requests arrive too fast, defined as
<code>$ua-&gt;delay</code> minutes not passed since last request to the
given server. The default is true. If this value is false then an
internal <code>SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE</code> response will be generated. It
will have a <code>Retry-After</code> header that indicates when it is OK
to send another request to this server.</p>
<h2>rules</h2>
<p>my $rules = $ua-&gt;rules; $ua-&gt;rules( $rules );</p>
<p>Set/get which <em>WWW::RobotRules</em> object to use.</p>
<h2>no_visits</h2>
<p>my $num = $ua-&gt;no_visits( $netloc )</p>
<p>Returns the number of documents fetched from this server host. Yeah I
know, this method should probably have been named
<code>num_visits</code> or something like that. :-(</p>
<h2>host_wait</h2>
<p>my $num = $ua-&gt;host_wait( $netloc )</p>
<p>Returns the number of <em>seconds</em> (from now) you must wait
before you can make a new request to this host.</p>
<h2>as_string</h2>
<p>my $string = $ua-&gt;as_string;</p>
<p>Returns a string that describes the state of the UA. Mainly useful
for debugging.</p>
