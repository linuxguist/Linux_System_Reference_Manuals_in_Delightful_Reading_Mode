<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>IO::Wrap - wrap raw filehandles in IO::Handle interface</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use IO::Wrap; ### Do stuff with any kind of filehandle (including a
bare globref), or ### any kind of blessed object that responds to a
print() message. ### sub do_stuff { my $fh = shift; ### At this point,
we have no idea what the user gave us... ### a globref? a FileHandle? a
scalar filehandle name? $fh = wraphandle($fh); ### At this point, we
know we have an IO::Handle-like object! $fh-&gt;print("Hey there!"); ...
}</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Let's say you want to write some code which does I/O, but you don't
want to force the caller to provide you with a FileHandle or IO::Handle
object. You want them to be able to say:</p>
<p>do_stuff(\*STDOUT); do_stuff(STDERR);
do_stuff($some_FileHandle_object); do_stuff($some_IO_Handle_object);</p>
<p>And even:</p>
<p>do_stuff($any_object_with_a_print_method);</p>
<p>Sure, one way to do it is to force the caller to use
<strong>tiehandle()</strong>. But that puts the burden on them. Another
way to do it is to use <strong>IO::Wrap</strong>, which provides you
with the following functions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>wraphandle SCALAR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function will take a single argument, and wrap it based on what
it seems to be...</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A raw scalar filehandle name,</strong> like
<code>"STDOUT"</code> or <code>"Class::HANDLE"</code>. In this case, the
filehandle name is wrapped in an IO::Wrap object, which is
returned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A raw filehandle glob,</strong> like
<code>\*STDOUT</code>. In this case, the filehandle glob is wrapped in
an IO::Wrap object, which is returned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A blessed FileHandle object.</strong> In this case, the
FileHandle is wrapped in an IO::Wrap object if and only if your
FileHandle class does not support the <code>read()</code>
method.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Any other kind of blessed object,</strong> which is
assumed to be already conformant to the IO::Handle interface. In this
case, you just get back that object.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you get back an IO::Wrap object, it will obey a basic subset of
the IO:: interface. That is, the following methods (note: I said
<em>methods</em>, not named operators) should work on the thing you get
back:</p>
<p>close getline getlines print ARGS... read BUFFER,NBYTES seek
POS,WHENCE tell</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Clearly, when wrapping a raw external filehandle (like \*STDOUT), I
didn't want to close the file descriptor when the wrapper object is
destroyed... since the user might not appreciate that! Hence, there's no
DESTROY method in this class.</p>
<p>When wrapping a FileHandle object, however, I believe that Perl will
invoke the FileHandle::DESTROY when the last reference goes away, so in
that case, the filehandle is closed if the wrapped FileHandle really was
the last reference to it.</p>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p>This module does not allow you to wrap filehandle names which are
given as strings that lack the package they were opened in. That is, if
a user opens FOO in package Foo, they must pass it to you either as
<code>\*FOO</code> or as <code>"Foo::FOO"</code>. However,
<code>"STDIN"</code> and friends will work just fine.</p>
