<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::fileevent - Execute a callback when a filehandle becomes readable
or writable</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>fileevent</strong>(<em>fileHandle</em>,<strong>readable</strong>?,<em>callback</em>?)</p>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>fileevent</strong>(<em>fileHandle</em>,<strong>writable</strong>?,<em>callback</em>?)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command is used to create <em>file event handlers</em>. A file
event handler is a binding between a filehandle and a callback, such
that the callback is evaluated whenever the filehandle becomes readable
or writable. File event handlers are most commonly used to allow data to
be received from another process on an event-driven basis, so that the
receiver can continue to interact with the user while waiting for the
data to arrive. If an application invokes <code>&lt;&gt;</code>,
<code>sysread</code> or <code>read</code> on a blocking filehandle when
there is no input data available, the process will block; until the
input data arrives, it will not be able to service other events, so it
will appear to the user to ``freeze up''. With
<strong>fileevent</strong>, the process can tell when data is present
and only invoke <strong>gets</strong> or <strong>read</strong> when they
won't block.</p>
<p>The <em>fileHandle</em> argument to <strong>fileevent</strong> refers
to an open filehandle, such as the return value from a previous
<strong>open</strong> or <strong>socket</strong> command. If the
<em>callback</em> argument is specified, then <strong>fileevent</strong>
creates a new event handler: <em>callback</em> will be evaluated
whenever the filehandle becomes readable or writable (depending on the
argument to <strong>fileevent</strong>). In this case
<strong>fileevent</strong> returns an empty string. The
<strong>readable</strong> and <strong>writable</strong> event handlers
for a file are independent, and may be created and deleted separately.
However, there may be at most one <strong>readable</strong> and one
<strong>writable</strong> handler for a file at a given time in a given
interpreter. If <strong>fileevent</strong> is called when the specified
handler already exists in the invoking interpreter, the new callback
replaces the old one.</p>
<p>If the <em>callback</em> argument is not specified,
<strong>fileevent</strong> returns the current callback for
<em>fileHandle</em>, or an empty string if there is none. If the
<em>callback</em> argument is specified as an empty string then the
event handler is deleted, so that no callback will be invoked. A file
event handler is also deleted automatically whenever its filehandle is
closed or its interpreter is deleted.</p>
<p>A filehandle is considered to be readable if there is unread data
available on the underlying device. A filehandle is also considered to
be readable if an end of file or error condition is present on the
underlying file or device. It is important for <em>callback</em> to
check for these conditions and handle them appropriately; for example,
if there is no special check for end of file, an infinite loop may occur
where <em>callback</em> reads no data, returns, and is immediately
invoked again.</p>
<p>A filehandle is considered to be writable if at least one byte of
data can be written to the underlying file or device without blocking,
or if an error condition is present on the underlying file or
device.</p>
<p>Event-driven I/O works best for filehandles that have been placed
into nonblocking mode. In blocking mode, a <code>print</code> command
may block if you give it more data than the underlying file or device
can accept, and a <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, <code>sysread</code> or
<code>read</code> command will block if you attempt to read more data
than is ready; no events will be processed while the commands block. In
nonblocking mode <code>print</code>, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>,
<code>sysread</code> and <code>read</code> never block. See the
documentation for the individual commands for information on how they
handle blocking and nonblocking filehandles.</p>
<p>The callback for a file event is executed in the context of
<em><code>$widget</code></em> with which <strong>fileevent</strong> was
invoked. If an error occurs while executing the callback then the
Tk::Error mechanism is used to report the error. In addition, the file
event handler is deleted if it ever returns an error; this is done in
order to prevent infinite loops due to buggy handlers.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>On windows platforms <strong>fileevent</strong> is limited in the
types of filehandles that behave correctly. Making filehandles
non-blocking is only implemented on a subset of UNIX platforms (see
Tk::IO).</p>
<h1>CREDITS</h1>
<p><strong>fileevent</strong> is based on the <strong>addinput</strong>
command created by Mark Diekhans.</p>
