<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib - Perl wrappers for the GLib utility and Object libraries</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Glib;</p>
<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This module provides perl access to GLib and GLib's GObject
libraries. GLib is a portability and utility library; GObject provides a
generic type system with inheritance and a powerful signal system.
Together these libraries are used as the foundation for many of the
libraries that make up the Gnome environment, and are used in many
unrelated projects.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This wrapper attempts to provide a perlish interface while remaining
as true as possible to the underlying C API, so that any reference
materials you can find on using GLib may still apply to using the
libraries from perl. This module also provides facilities for creating
wrappers for other GObject-based libraries. The SEE ALSO section
contains pointers to all sorts of good information.</p>
<h1>PERL VERSUS C</h1>
<p>GLib provides to C programs many of the same facilities Perl offers
natively. Where GLib's functionality overlaps Perl's, Perl's is favored.
Some concepts have been eliminated entirely, as Perl is a higher-level
language than C. In other instances we've had to add or change APIs to
make sense in Perl. Here's a quick run-down:</p>
<h2>Perl Already Does That</h2>
<p>The GLib types GList (a doubly-linked list), GSList (singly-linked
list), GHashTable, GArray, etc have all been replaced by native Perl
datatypes. In fact, many functions which take GLists or arrays simply
accept lists on the Perl stack. For the most part, GIOChannels are no
more functional than Perl file handles, so you won't see any
GIOChannels. GClosures are not visible at the Perl level, because Perl
code references do the same thing. Just about any function taking either
a C function pointer or a GClosure will accept a code reference in Perl.
(In fact, you can probably get away with just a subroutine name in many
spots, provided you aren't using strict subs.)</p>
<h2>Don't Worry About That</h2>
<p>Some concepts have been eliminated; you need never worry about
reference-counting on GObjects or having to free GBoxed structures. Perl
is a garbage-collected language, and we've put a lot of work into making
the bindings take care of memory for you in a way that feels natural to
a Perl developer. You won't see GValues in Perl (that's just a C
structure with Perl scalar envy, anyway).</p>
<h2>This Is Now That</h2>
<p>Other GLib concepts have been converted to an analogous Perl
concept.</p>
<p>The GType id will never be seen in Perl, as the package name serves
that purpose. Several packages corresponding to the GTypes of the
fundamental types have been registered for you:</p>
<p>G_TYPE_STRING Glib::String G_TYPE_INT Glib::Int G_TYPE_UINT
Glib::UInt G_TYPE_DOUBLE Glib::Double G_TYPE_BOOLEAN Glib::Boolean</p>
<p>The remaining fundamentals (char/uchar, short, float, etc) are also
registered so that we can properly interact with properties of C
objects, but perl really only uses ints, uints, and doubles. Oh, and we
created a GBoxed type for Perl scalars so you can use scalars where any
boxed type would be allowed (e.g. GtkTreeModel columns):</p>
<p>Glib::Scalar</p>
<p>Functions that can return false and set a GError in C raise an
exception in Perl, using an exception object based on the GError for $@;
see Glib::Error. Trapping exceptions in signals is a sticky issue, so
they get their own section; see EXCEPTIONS.</p>
<p>Enumerations and flags are treated as strings and arrays of strings,
respectively. GLib provides a way to register nicknames for enumeration
values, and the Perl bindings use these nicknames for the real values,
so that we never have to deal with numbers in Perl. This can get a
little cumbersome for bitfields, but it's very nice when you forget a
flag value, as the bindings will tell you what values are accepted when
you pass something invalid. Also, the bindings consider the - and _
characters to be equivalent, so that signal and property names can be
properly stringified by the =&gt; operator. For example, the following
are equivalent:</p>
<p># property foo-matic of type FooType, using the # value
FOO_SOMETHING_COOL. its nickname would be # something-cool. you may use
either the full # name or the nickname when supplying values to perl.
$object-&gt;set (foo-matic, FOO_SOMETHING_COOL); $object-&gt;set
(foo_matic, something_cool); $object-&gt;set (foo_matic =&gt;
something-cool);</p>
<p>Beware that Perl will always return to you the nickname form, with
the dash.</p>
<p>Flags have some additional magic abilities in the form of overloaded
operators:</p>
<p>+ or | union of two flagsets ("add") - difference of two flagsets
("sub", "remove") * or &amp; intersection of two bitsets ("and") / or ^
symmetric difference ("xor", you will rarely need this) &gt;=
contains-operator ("is the left set a superset of the right set?") ==
equality</p>
<p>In addition, flags in boolean context indicate whether they are empty
or not, which allows you to write common operations naturally:</p>
<p>$widget-&gt;set_events ($widget-&gt;get_events -
"motion_notify_mask"); $widget-&gt;set_events ($widget-&gt;get_events -
["motion_notify_mask", "button_press_mask"]); # shift pressed (both
work, its a matter of taste) if ($event-&gt;state &gt;= "shift-mask") {
... if ($event-&gt;state * "shift-mask") { ... # either shift OR control
pressed? if ($event-&gt;state * ["shift-mask", "control-mask"]) { ... #
both shift AND control pressed? if ($event-&gt;state &gt;=
["shift-mask", "control-mask"]) { ...</p>
<p>In general, <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> work as expected to add
or remove flags. To test whether <em>any</em> bits are set in a mask,
you use <code>$mask * ...</code>, and to test whether <em>all</em> bits
are set in a mask, you use <code>$mask &gt;= ...</code>.</p>
<p>When dereferenced as an array <code>@$flags</code> or
<code>$flags-&gt;[...]</code>, you can access the flag values directly
as strings (but you are not allowed to modify the array), and when
stringified <code>"$flags"</code> a flags value will output a
human-readable version of its contents.</p>
<h2>It's All the Same</h2>
<p>For the most part, the remaining bits of GLib are unchanged.
GMainLoop is now Glib::MainLoop, GObject is now Glib::Object, GBoxed is
now Glib::Boxed, etc.</p>
<h1>FILENAMES, URIS AND ENCODINGS</h1>
<p>Perl knows two datatypes, unicode text and binary bytes. Filenames on
a system that doesn't use a utf-8 locale are often stored in a local
encoding (binary bytes). Gtk+ and descendants, however, internally work
in unicode most of the time, so when feeding a filename into a GLib/Gtk+
function that expects a filename, you first need to convert it from the
local encoding to unicode.</p>
<p>This involves some elaborate guessing, which perl currently avoids,
but GLib and Gtk+ do. As an exception, some Gtk+ functions want a
filename in local encoding, but the perl interface usually works around
this by automatically converting it for you.</p>
<p>In short: Everything should be in unicode on the perl level.</p>
<p>The following functions expose the conversion algorithm that GLib
uses.</p>
<p>These functions are only necessary when you want to use perl
functions to manage filenames returned by a GLib/Gtk+ function, or when
you feed filenames into GLib/Gtk+ functions that have their source
outside your program (e.g. commandline arguments, readdir results
etc.).</p>
<p>These functions are available as exports by request (see Exports),
and also support method invocation syntax for pathological consistency
with the OO syntax of the rest of the bindings.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$filename = filename_to_unicode $filename_in_local_encoding</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$filename = Glib-&gt;filename_to_unicode
($filename_in_local_encoding)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Convert a perl string that supposedly contains a filename in local
encoding into a filename represented as unicode, the same way that GLib
does it internally. Example: $gtkfilesel-&gt;set_filename
(filename_to_unicode $ARGV[1]); This function will
<strong>croak()</strong> if the conversion cannot be made, e.g., because
the utf-8 is invalid.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$filename_in_local_encoding = filename_from_unicode $filename</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$filename_in_local_encoding = Glib-&gt;filename_from_unicode
($filename)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Converts a perl string containing a filename into a filename in the
local encoding in the same way GLib does it. Example: open MY, "&lt;",
filename_from_unicode $gtkfilesel-&gt;get_filename;</p>
<p>It might be useful to know that perl currently has no policy at all
regarding filename issues, if your scalar happens to be in utf-8
internally it will use utf-8, if it happens to be stored as bytes, it
will use it as-is.</p>
<p>When dealing with filenames that you need to display, there is a much
easier way, as of Glib 1.120 and glib 2.6.0:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$uft8_string = filename_display_name ($filename)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$uft8_string = filename_display_basename ($filename)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Given a <em><code>$filename</code></em> in filename encoding, return
the filename, or just the file's basename, in utf-8. Unlike the other
functions described above, this one is guaranteed to return valid utf-8,
but the conversion is not necessarily reversible. These functions are
intended to be used for failsafe display of filenames, for example in
gtk+ labels. Since glib 2.6, Glib 1.12</p>
<p>The following convert filenames to and from URI encoding. (See also
URI::file.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>$string = filename_to_uri ($filename, $hostname)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$string = Glib-&gt;filename_to_uri ($filename, $hostname)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Return a file:// schema URI for a filename. Unsafe and non-ascii
chars in <code>$filename</code> are escaped with URI % forms.
<code>$filename</code> must be an absolute path as a byte string in
local filesystem encoding. <code>$hostname</code> is a utf-8 string, or
empty or <code>undef</code> for no host specified. For example,
filename_to_uri (/my/x%y/&lt;dir&gt;/foo.html, undef); # returns
file:///my/x%25y/%3Cdir%3E/foo.html If <code>$filename</code> is a
relative path or <code>$hostname</code> doesn't look like a hostname
then <code>filename_to_uri</code> croaks with a
<code>Glib::Error</code>. When using the class style
<code>Glib-&gt;filename_to_uri</code> remember that the
<code>$hostname</code> argument is mandatory. If you forget then it
looks like a 2-argument call with filename of Glib and hostname of what
you meant to be the filename.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$filename = filename_from_uri ($uri)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>($filename, $hostname) = filename_from_uri ($uri)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Extract the filename and hostname from a file:// schema URI. In
scalar context just the filename is returned, in array context both
filename and hostname are returned. The filename returned is bytes in
the local filesystem encoding and with the OS path separator character.
The hostname returned is utf-8. For example, ($f,$h) = filename_from_uri
(file://foo.com/r%26b/bar.html); # returns /r&amp;b/bar.html and foo.com
on Unix If <code>$uri</code> is not a file:, or is mal-formed, or the
hostname part doesn't look like a host name then
<code>filename_from_uri</code> croaks with a
<code>Glib::Error</code>.</p>
<h1>EXCEPTIONS</h1>
<p>The C language doesn't support exceptions; GLib is a C library, and
of course doesn't support exceptions either. In Perl, we use die and
eval to raise and trap exceptions as a rather common practice. So, the
bindings have to work a little black magic behind the scenes to keep
GLib from exploding when the Perl program uses exceptions.
Unfortunately, a little of this magic has to leak out to where you can
see it at the Perl level.</p>
<p>Signal and event handlers are run in an eval context; if an exception
occurs in such a handler and you don't catch it, Perl will report that
an error occurred, and then go on about its business like nothing
happened.</p>
<p>You may register subroutines as exception handlers, to be called when
such an exception is trapped. Another function removes them for you.</p>
<p>$tag = Glib-&gt;install_exception_handler (\&amp;my_handler);
Glib-&gt;remove_exception_handler ($tag);</p>
<p>The exception handler will get a fresh copy of the $@ of the
offending exception on the argument stack, and is expected to return
non-zero if the handler is to remain installed. If it returns false, the
handler will be removed.</p>
<p>sub my_handler { if ($_[0] =~ m/ftang quisinart/) {
clean_up_after_ftang (); } 1; # live to fight another day }</p>
<p>You can register as many handlers as you like; they will all run
independently.</p>
<p>An important thing to remember is that exceptions do not cross main
loops. In fact, exceptions are completely distinct from main loops. If
you need to quit a main loop when an exception occurs, install a handler
that quits the main loop, but also ask yourself if you are using
exceptions for flow control or exception handling.</p>
<h1>LOG MESSAGES</h1>
<p>GLib's g_log function provides a flexible mechanism for reporting
messages, and most GLib-based C libraries use this mechanism for
warnings, assertions, critical messages, etc. The Perl bindings offer a
mechanism for routing these messages through Perl's native system,
<strong>warn()</strong> and <strong>die()</strong>. Extensions should
register the log domains they wrap for this to happen fluidly. [FIXME
say more here]</p>
<h1>64 BIT INTEGERS</h1>
<p>Since perl's integer data type can only hold 32 bit values on all 32
bit machines and even on some 64 bit machines, Glib converts 64 bit
integers to and from strings if necessary. These strings can then be
used to feed one of the various big integer modules. Make sure you don't
let your strings get into numerical context before passing them into a
Glib function because in this case, perl will convert the number to
scientific notation which at this point is not understood by Glib's
converters.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of what big integer modules are available. First
of all, there's Math::BigInt. It has everything you will ever need, but
its pure-Perl implementation is also rather slow. There are multiple
ways around this, though.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Math::BigInt::FastCalc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Math::BigInt::FastCalc can help avoid the glacial speed of vanilla
Math::BigInt::Calc. Recent versions of Math::BigInt will automatically
use Math::BigInt::FastCalc in place of Math::BigInt::Calc when
available. Other options include Math::BigInt::GMP or
Math::BigInt::Pari, which however have much larger dependencies.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Math::BigInt::Lite</dt>
<dd>
<p>Then there's Math::BigInt::Lite, which uses native Perl integer
operations as long as Perl integers have sufficient range, and upgrades
itself to Math::BigInt when Perl integers would overflow. This must be
used in place of Math::BigInt.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bigint / bignum / bigfloat</dt>
<dd>
<p>Finally, there's the bigint/bignum/bigfloat pragmata, which
automatically load the corresponding Math:: modules and which will
autobox constants. bignum/bigint will automatically use
Math::BigInt::Lite if it's available.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>EXPORTS</h1>
<p>For the most part, gtk2-perl avoids exporting things. Nothing is
exported by default, but some functions and constants in Glib are
available by request; you can also get all of them with the export tag
all.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tag: constants</dt>
<dd>
<p> TRUE FALSE SOURCE_CONTINUE SOURCE_REMOVE G_PRIORITY_HIGH
G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE
G_PRIORITY_LOW G_PARAM_READWRITE</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tag: functions</dt>
<dd>
<p> filename_from_unicode filename_to_unicode filename_from_uri
filename_to_uri filename_display_basename filename_display_name</p>
</dd>
