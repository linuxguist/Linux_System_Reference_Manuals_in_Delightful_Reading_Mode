<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::bindtags - Determine which bindings apply to a window, and order
of evaluation</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>bindtags</strong>([<em>tagList</em>]);</p>
<p><em><code>@tags</code></em> =
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>bindtags</strong>;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>When a binding is created with the <strong>bind</strong> command, it
is associated either with a particular window such as
<em><code>$widget</code></em>, a class name such as
<strong>Tk::Button</strong>, the keyword <strong>all</strong>, or any
other string. All of these forms are called <em>binding tags</em>. Each
window has a list of binding tags that determine how events are
processed for the window. When an event occurs in a window, it is
applied to each of the window's tags in order: for each tag, the most
specific binding that matches the given tag and event is executed. See
the Tk::bind documentation for more information on the matching
process.</p>
<p>By default, each window has four binding tags consisting of the the
window's class name, name of the window, the name of the window's
nearest toplevel ancestor, and <strong>all</strong>, in that order.
Toplevel windows have only three tags by default, since the toplevel
name is the same as that of the window.</p>
<p>Note that this order is <em>different</em> from order used by Tcl/Tk.
Tcl/Tk has the window ahead of the class name in the binding order. This
is because Tcl is procedural rather than object oriented and the normal
way for Tcl/Tk applications to override class bindings is with an
instance binding. However, with perl/Tk the normal way to override a
class binding is to derive a class. The perl/Tk order causes instance
bindings to execute after the class binding, and so instance bind
callbacks can make use of state changes (e.g. changes to the selection)
than the class bindings have made.</p>
<p>The <strong>bindtags</strong> command allows the binding tags for a
window to be read and modified.</p>
<p>If <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>bindtags</strong> is
invoked without an argument, then the current set of binding tags for
<code>$widget</code> is returned as a list. If the <em>tagList</em>
argument is specified to <strong>bindtags</strong>, then it must be a
reference to and array; the tags for <code>$widget</code> are changed to
the elements of the array. (A reference to an anonymous array can be
created by enclosin the elements in <strong>[ ]</strong>.) The elements
of <em>tagList</em> may be arbitrary strings or widget objects, if no
window exists for an object at the time an event is processed, then the
tag is ignored for that event. The order of the elements in
<em>tagList</em> determines the order in which binding callbacks are
executed in response to events. For example, the command</p>
<p>$b-&gt;bindtags([$b,ref($b),$b-&gt;toplevel,all])</p>
<p>applies the Tcl/Tk binding order which binding callbacks will be
evaluated for a button (say) <strong><code>$b</code></strong> so that
<strong><code>$b</code></strong>'s instance bindings are invoked first,
following by bindings for <strong><code>$b</code></strong>'s class,
followed by bindings for <strong><code>$b</code></strong>'s toplevel,
followed by '<strong>all</strong>' bindings.</p>
<p>If <em>tagList</em> is an empty list i.e. <strong>[]</strong>, then
the binding tags for <code>$widget</code> are returned to the perl/Tk
default state described above.</p>
<p>The <strong>bindtags</strong> command may be used to introduce
arbitrary additional binding tags for a window, or to remove standard
tags. For example, the command</p>
<p>$b-&gt;bindtags([TrickyButton,$b-&gt;toplevel,all])</p>
<p>replaces the (say) <strong>Tk::Button</strong> tag for
<strong><code>$b</code></strong> with <strong>TrickyButton</strong>.
This means that the default widget bindings for buttons, which are
associated with the <strong>Tk::Button</strong> tag, will no longer
apply to <strong><code>$b</code></strong>, but any bindings associated
with <strong>TrickyButton</strong> (perhaps some new button behavior)
will apply.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>The current mapping of the 'native' Tk behaviour of this method i.e.
returning a list but only accepting a reference to an array is counter
intuitive. The perl/Tk interface may be tidied up, returning a list is
sensible so, most likely fix will be to allow a list to be passed to
<em>set</em> the bindtags.</p>
