<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::Type - Utilities for dealing with the GLib Type system</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This package defines several utilities for dealing with the GLib type
system from Perl. Because of some fundamental differences in how the
GLib and Perl type systems work, a fair amount of the binding magic
leaks out, and you can find most of that in the
<code>Glib::Type::register*</code> functions, which register new types
with the GLib type system.</p>
<p>Most of the rest of the functions provide introspection
functionality, such as listing properties and values and other cool
stuff that is used mainly by Glib's reference documentation generator
(see Glib::GenPod).</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<h2>list = Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>list_ancestors</strong>
($package)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$package</code> (string)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>List the ancestry of <em>package</em>, as seen by the GLib type
system. The important difference is that GLib's type system implements
only single inheritance, whereas Perl's <code>@ISA</code> allows
multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>This returns the package names of the ancestral types in reverse
order, with the root of the tree at the end of the list.</p>
<p>See also list_interfaces ().</p>
<h2>list = Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>list_interfaces</strong>
($package)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$package</code> (string)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>List the GInterfaces implemented by the type associated with
<em>package</em>. The interfaces are returned as package names.</p>
<h2>list = Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>list_signals</strong> ($package)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$package</code> (string)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>List the signals associated with <em>package</em>. This lists only
the signals for <em>package</em>, not any of its parents. The signals
are returned as a list of anonymous hashes which mirror the GSignalQuery
structure defined in the C API reference.</p>
<dl>
<dt>- signal_id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric id of a signal. It's rare that you'll need this in
Gtk2-Perl.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- signal_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the signal, such as what you'd pass to
<code>signal_connect</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- itype</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>i</em>nstance <em>type</em> for which this signal is
defined.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- signal_flags</dt>
<dd>
<p>GSignalFlags describing this signal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- return_type</dt>
<dd>
<p>The return type expected from handlers for this signal. If undef or
not present, then no return is expected. The type name is mapped to the
corresponding Perl package name if it is known, otherwise you get the
raw C name straight from GLib.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- param_types</dt>
<dd>
<p>The types of the parameters passed to any callbacks connected to the
emission of this signal. The list does not include the instance, which
is always first, and the user data from <code>signal_connect</code>,
which is always last (unless the signal was connected with swap, which
swaps the instance and the data, but you get the point).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>list = Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>list_values</strong> ($package)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$package</code> (string)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>List the legal values for the GEnum or GFlags type
<em><code>$package</code></em>. If <em><code>$package</code></em> is not
a package name registered with the bindings, this name is passed on to
<strong>g_type_from_name()</strong> to see if it's a registered flags or
enum type that just hasn't been registered with the bindings by
<code>gperl_register_fundamental()</code> (see Glib::xsapi). If
<em><code>$package</code></em> is not the name of an enum or flags type,
this function will croak.</p>
<p>Returns the values as a list of hashes, one hash for each value,
containing the value, name and nickname, eg. for Glib::SignalFlags</p>
<p>{ value =&gt; 8, name =&gt; G_SIGNAL_NO_RECURSE, nick =&gt;
no-recurse }</p>
<h2>string = Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>package_from_cname</strong>
($cname)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$cname</code> (string)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Convert a C type name to the corresponding Perl package name. If no
package is registered to that type, returns
<em><code>$cname</code></em>.</p>
<h2>Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>register</strong> ($parent_class, $new_class,
...)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$parent_class</code> (package) type from which to
derive</p></li>
<li><p><code>$new_class</code> (package) name of new type</p></li>
<li><p>... (list) arguments for creation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Register a new type with the GLib type system.</p>
<p>This is a traffic-cop function. If <em><code>$parent_type</code></em>
derives from Glib::Object, this passes the arguments through to
<code>register_object</code>. If <em><code>$parent_type</code></em> is
Glib::Flags or Glib::Enum, this strips
<em><code>$parent_type</code></em> and passes the remaining args on to
<code>register_enum</code> or <code>register_flags</code>. See those
functions' documentation for more information.</p>
<h2>Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>register_enum</strong> ($name, ...)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$name</code> (string) package name for new enum
type</p></li>
<li><p>... (list) new enum's values; see description.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Register and initialize a new Glib::Enum type with the provided
values. This creates a type properly registered GLib so that it can be
used for property and signal parameter or return types created with
<code>Glib::Type-&gt;register</code> or
<code>Glib::Object::Subclass</code>.</p>
<p>The list of values is used to create the nicknames that are used in
general Perl code; the actual numeric values used at the C level are
automatically assigned, starting with 1. If you need to specify a
particular numeric value for a nick, use an array reference containing
the nickname and the numeric value, instead. You may mix and match the
two styles.</p>
<p>Glib::Type-&gt;register_enum (MyFoo::Bar, value-one, # assigned 1
value-two, # assigned 2 [value-three =&gt; 15 ], # explicit 15
[value-four =&gt; 35 ], # explicit 35 value-five, # assigned 5 );</p>
<p>If you use the array-ref form, beware: the code performs no
validation for unique values.</p>
<h2>Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>register_flags</strong> ($name, ...)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$name</code> (string) package name of new flags
type</p></li>
<li><p>... (list) flag values, see discussion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Register and initialize a new Glib::Flags type with the provided
values. This creates a type properly registered GLib so that it can be
used for property and signal parameter or return types created with
<code>Glib::Type-&gt;register</code> or
<code>Glib::Object::Subclass</code>.</p>
<p>The list of values is used to create the nicknames that are used in
general Perl code; the actual numeric values used at the C level are
automatically assigned, of the form 1&lt;&lt;i, starting with i = 0. If
you need to specify a particular numeric value for a nick, use an array
reference containing the nickname and the numeric value, instead. You
may mix and match the two styles.</p>
<p>Glib::Type-&gt;register_flags (MyFoo::Baz, value-one, # assigned
1&lt;&lt;0 value-two, # assigned 1&lt;&lt;1 [value-three =&gt;
1&lt;&lt;10 ], # explicit 1&lt;&lt;10 [value-four =&gt; 0x0f ], #
explicit 0x0f value-five, # assigned 1&lt;&lt;4 );</p>
<p>If you use the array-ref form, beware: the code performs no
validation for unique values.</p>
<h2>Glib::Type-&gt;<strong>register_object</strong> ($parent_package,
$new_package, ...)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$parent_package</code> (string) name of the parent package,
which must be a derivative of Glib::Object.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$new_package</code> (string) usually
_ _PACKAGE_ _.</p></li>
<li><p>... (list) key/value pairs controlling how the class is
created.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Register <em>new_package</em> as an officially GLib-sanctioned
derivative of the (GObject derivative) <em>parent_package</em>. This
automatically sets up an <code>@ISA</code> entry for you, and creates a
new GObjectClass under the hood.</p>
<p>The <em>...</em> parameters are key/value pairs, currently
supporting:</p>
<dl>
<dt>signals =&gt; HASHREF</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>signals</code> key contains a hash, keyed by signal names,
which describes how to set up the signals for <em>new_package</em>. If
the value is a code reference, the named signal must exist somewhere in
<em>parent_package</em> or its ancestry; the code reference will be used
to override the class closure for that signal. This is the officially
sanctioned way to override virtual methods on Glib::Objects. The value
may be a string rather than a code reference, in which case the sub with
that name in <em>new_package</em> will be used. (The function should not
be inherited.) If the value is a hash reference, the key will be the
name of a new signal created with the properties defined in the hash.
All of the properties are optional, with defaults provided:</p>
<dl>
<dt>class_closure =&gt; subroutine or undef</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this code reference (or sub name) as the class closure (that is,
the default handler for the signal). If not specified,
"do_<em>signal_name</em>", in the current package, is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>return_type =&gt; package name or undef</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return type for the signal. If not specified, then the signal has
void return.</p>
</dd>
<dt>param_types =&gt; ARRAYREF</dt>
<dd>
<p>Reference to a list of parameter types (package names), <em>omitting
the instance</em> and user data. Callbacks connected to this signal will
receive the instance object as the first argument, followed by arguments
with the types listed here, and finally by any user data that was
supplied when the callback was connected. Not specifying this key is
equivalent to supplying an empty list, which actually means instance and
maybe data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>flags =&gt; Glib::SignalFlags</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flags describing this signal's properties. See the GObject C API
reference' description of GSignalFlags for a complete description.</p>
</dd>
<dt>accumulator =&gt; subroutine or undef</dt>
<dd>
<p>The signal accumulator is a special callback that can be used to
collect return values of the various callbacks that are called during a
signal emission. Generally, you can omit this parameter; custom
accumulators are used to do things like stopping signal propagation by
return value or creating a list of returns, etc. See SIGNALS in
Glib::Object::Subclass for details.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>properties =&gt; ARRAYREF</dt>
<dd>
<p>Array of Glib::ParamSpec objects, each describing an object property
to add to the new type. These properties are available for use by all
code that can access the object, regardless of implementation language.
See Glib::ParamSpec. This list may be empty; if it is not, the functions
<code>GET_PROPERTY</code> and <code>SET_PROPERTY</code> in
<em><code>$new_package</code></em> will be called to get and set the
values. Note that an object property is just a mechanism for getting and
setting a value Ω- it implies no storage. As a convenience, however,
Glib::Object provides fallbacks for GET_PROPERTY and SET_PROPERTY which
use the property nicknames as hash keys in the object variable for
storage. Additionally, you may specify ParamSpecs as a describing hash
instead of as an object; this form allows you to supply explicit getter
and setter methods which override GET_PROPERY and SET_PROPERTY. The
getter and setter are both optional in the hash form. For example:
Glib::Type-&gt;register_object (Glib::Object, Foo, properties =&gt; [ #
specified normally Glib::ParamSpec-&gt;string (...), # specified
explicitly { pspec =&gt; Glib::ParamSpec-&gt;int (...), set =&gt; sub {
my ($object, $newval) = @_; ... }, get =&gt; sub { my ($object) = @_;
... return $val; }, }, ] ); You can mix the two declaration styles as
you like. If you have individual <code>get_foo</code> /
<code>set_foo</code> methods with the operative code for a property then
the <code>get</code>/<code>set</code> form is a handy way to go straight
to that.</p>
</dd>
<dt>interfaces =&gt; ARRAYREF</dt>
<dd>
<p>Array of interface package names that the new object implements.
Interfaces are the GObject way of doing multiple inheritance, thus, in
Perl, the package names will be prepended to <code>@ISA</code> and
certain inheritable and overrideable ALLCAPS methods will automatically
be called whenever needed. Which methods exactly depends on the
interface Ω- Gtk2::CellEditable for example uses START_EDITING,
EDITING_DONE, and REMOVE_WIDGET.</p>
