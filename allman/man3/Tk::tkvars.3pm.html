<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::tkvars - Variables used or set by Tk</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The following perl variables are either set or used by Tk at various
times in its execution. (For a list of variables used by perl see
perlvar.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>$Tk::library</dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable holds the file name for a directory containing the
modules related to Tk. These modules include an initialization file that
is normally processed whenever a Tk application starts up, plus other
files containing procedures that implement default behaviors for
widgets. The initial value of <strong><code>$Tk::library</code></strong>
is set when Tk is added to an interpreter; this is done by searching
searching for a directory named Tk in the directory where the file
<em>Tk.pm</em>, or the first directory <em>Tk</em> in <code>@INC</code>.
The <strong>TK_LIBRARY</strong> environment variable used by Tcl/Tk is
not supported by perl/Tk. Please use <code>@INC</code> to change where
modules are searched. <strong>Note:</strong> This is Tcl remnant. With
perl it makes more sense to use <code>@INC</code> and
<code>%INC</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$Tk::patchLevel</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains a decimal integer giving the current patch level for Tk. The
patch level is incremented for each new release or patch, and it
uniquely identifies an official version of Tk. <strong>Note:</strong>
this is Tcl remnant. With perl it makes more sense to use
<strong><code>$Tk::VERSION</code></strong> described below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$Tk::strictMotif</dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable is set to zero by default. If an application sets it to
one, then Tk attempts to adhere as closely as possible to Motif
look-and-feel standards. For example, active elements such as buttons
and scrollbar sliders will not change color when the pointer passes over
them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$Tk::VERSION</dt>
<dd>
<p>The variable holds the current version number of the perl/Tk release
in the form <em>major</em>.<em>minor</em>. <em>Major</em> and
<em>minor</em> are integers. The <em>major</em> version number shows on
which Tcl/Tk release perl/Tk is based. E.g., <strong>402</strong> means
based on Tcls Tk 4.2. (Patchlevel of Tcls Tk are not incorporated
because perl/Tk tended to be ``<em>ahead</em>'' of them on some fixes
and behind on others. The first digest of the major version number
increases in any Tk release that includes changes that are not backward
compatible (i.e. whenever existing perl/Tk applications and scripts may
have to change to work with the new release). The <em>minor</em> version
depends on perl/Tk only. It uses the 'even'='stable',
'odd'='experimental' scheme that linux uses: .0xx - inherently alpha
.1xx - experimental beta .2xx - stable .3xx - experimental .4xx - stable
... The minor version number increases with each new release of Tk,
except that it resets to zero whenever the major version number
changes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$Tk::version</dt>
<dd>
<p>The variable holds the current version number of the Tk library in
the form <em>major</em>.<em>minor</em>. <em>Major</em> and
<em>minor</em> are integers. The major version number increases in any
Tk release that includes changes that are not backward compatible (i.e.
whenever existing Tk applications and scripts may have to change to work
with the new release). The minor version number increases with each new
release of Tk, except that it resets to zero whenever the major version
number changes. <strong>Note:</strong> this is Tcl remnant. With perl it
makes more sense to use <strong><code>$Tk::VERSION</code></strong>
described above.</p>
