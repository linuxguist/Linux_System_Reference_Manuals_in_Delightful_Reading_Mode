<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Net::DBus::Test::MockConnection - Fake a connection to the bus unit
testing</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Net::DBus; my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;test # Register a service, and
the objec to be tested use MyObject my $service =
$bus-&gt;export_service("org.example.MyService"); my $object =
MyObject-&gt;new($service); # Acquire the service &amp; do tests my
$remote_service = $bus-&gt;get_service(org.example.MyService); my
$remote_object = $service-&gt;get_object("/org/example/MyObjct"); # This
traverses the mock connection, eventually # invoking testSomething on
the $object above. $remote_object-&gt;testSomething()</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This object provides a fake implementation of the
Net::DBus::Binding::Connection enabling a pure 'in-memory' message bus
to be mocked up. This is intended to facilitate creation of unit tests
for services which would otherwise need to call out to other object on a
live message bus. It is used as a companion to the
Net::DBus::Test::MockObject module which is how fake objects are to be
provided on the fake bus.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>my $con = Net::DBus::Test::MockConnection-&gt;new()</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a new mock connection object instance. It is not usually
necessary to create instances of this object directly, instead the
<code>test</code> method on the Net::DBus object can be used to get a
handle to a test bus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$con-&gt;send($message)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Send a message over the mock connection. If the message is a method
call, it will be dispatched straight to any corresponding mock object
registered. If the message is an error or method return it will be made
available as a return value for the
<code>send_with_reply_and_block</code> method. If the message is a
signal it will be queued up for processing by the <code>dispatch</code>
method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$bus-&gt;request_name($service_name)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pretend to send a request to the bus registering the well known name
specified in the <code>$service_name</code> parameter. In reality this
is just a no-op giving the impression that the name was successfully
registered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $reply = $con-&gt;send_with_reply_and_block($msg)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Send a message over the mock connection and wait for a reply. The
<code>$msg</code> should be an instance of
<code>Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall</code> and the return
<code>$reply</code> will be an instance of
<code>Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodReturn</code>. It is also
possible that an error will be thrown, with the thrown error being
blessed into the <code>Net::DBus::Error</code> class.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$con-&gt;dispatch;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dispatches any pending messages in the incoming queue to their
message handlers. This method should be called by test suites whenever
they anticipate that there are pending signals to be dealt with.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$con-&gt;add_filter($coderef);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds a filter to the connection which will be invoked whenever a
message is received. The <code>$coderef</code> should be a reference to
a subroutine, which returns a true value if the message should be
filtered out, or a false value if the normal message dispatch should be
performed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$bus-&gt;add_match($rule)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Register a signal match rule with the bus controller, allowing
matching broadcast signals to routed to this client. In reality this is
just a no-op giving the impression that the match was successfully
registered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$bus-&gt;remove_match($rule)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unregister a signal match rule with the bus controller, preventing
further broadcast signals being routed to this client. In reality this
is just a no-op giving the impression that the match was successfully
unregistered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$con-&gt;register_object_path($path, \&amp;handler)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Registers a handler for messages whose path matches that specified in
the <code>$path</code> parameter. The supplied code reference will be
invoked with two parameters, the connection object on which the message
was received, and the message to be processed (an instance of the
<code>Net::DBus::Binding::Message</code> class).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$con-&gt;register_fallback($path, \&amp;handler)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Registers a handler for messages whose path starts with the prefix
specified in the <code>$path</code> parameter. The supplied code
reference will be invoked with two parameters, the connection object on
which the message was received, and the message to be processed (an
instance of the <code>Net::DBus::Binding::Message</code> class).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$con-&gt;unregister_object_path($path)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unregisters the handler associated with the object path
<code>$path</code>. The handler would previously have been registered
with the <code>register_object_path</code> or
<code>register_fallback</code> methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $msg = $con-&gt;make_error_message($replyto, $name,
$description)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a new message, representing an error which occurred during
the handling of the method call object passed in as the
<code>$replyto</code> parameter. The <code>$name</code> parameter is the
formal name of the error condition, while the <code>$description</code>
is a short piece of text giving more specific information on the
error.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $call = $con-&gt;make_method_call_message( $service_name,
$object_path, $interface, $method_name);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a message representing a call on the object located at the
path <code>$object_path</code> within the client owning the well-known
name given by <code>$service_name</code>. The method to be invoked has
the name <code>$method_name</code> within the interface specified by the
<code>$interface</code> parameter.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $msg = $con-&gt;make_method_return_message($replyto)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a message representing a reply to the method call message
passed in the <code>$replyto</code> parameter.</p>
</dd>
<dt>my $msg = $con-&gt;make_signal_message($object_path, $interface,
$signal_name);</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a new message, representing a signal [to be] emitted by the
object located under the path given by the <code>$object_path</code>
parameter. The name of the signal is given by the
<code>$signal_name</code> parameter, and is scoped to the interface
given by the <code>$interface</code> parameter.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>It doesn't completely replicate the API of
Net::DBus::Binding::Connection, merely enough to make the high level
bindings work in a test scenario.</p>
