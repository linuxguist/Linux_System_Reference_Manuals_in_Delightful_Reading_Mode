<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::version - Library Versioning Utilities</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p># require at least version 1.021 of the Glib module use Glib 1.021; #
g_set_application_name() was introduced in GLib 2.2.0, and # first
supported by version 1.040 of the Glib Perl module. if ($Glib::VERSION
&gt;= 1.040 and Glib-&gt;CHECK_VERSION (2,2,0)) {
Glib::set_application_name (My Cool Program); }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Both the Glib module and the GLib C library are works-in-progress,
and their interfaces grow over time. As more features are added to each,
and your code uses those new features, you will introduce
version-specific dependencies, and naturally, you'll want to be able to
code around them. Enter the versioning API.</p>
<p>For simple Perl modules, a single version number is sufficient;
however, Glib is a binding to another software library, and this
introduces some complexity. We have three versions that fully specify
the API available to you.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Perl Bindings Version</dt>
<dd>
<p>Perl modules use a version number, and Glib is no exception.
<em><code>$Glib::VERSION</code></em> is the version of the current Glib
module. By ad hoc convention, gtk2-perl modules generally use version
numbers in the form x.yyz, where even yy values denote stable releases
and z is a patchlevel. $Glib::VERSION use Glib 1.040; # require at least
version 1.040</p>
</dd>
<dt>Compile-time ("Bound") Library Version</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the version of the GLib C library that was available when the
Perl module was compiled and installed. These version constants are
equivalent to the version macros provided in the GLib C headers. GLib
uses a major.minor.micro convention, where even minor versions are
stable. (gtk2-perl does not officially support unstable versions.)
Glib::MAJOR_VERSION Glib::MINOR_VERSION Glib::MICRO_VERSION
Glib-&gt;CHECK_VERSION($maj,$min,$mic)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Run-time ("Linked") Library Version</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the version of the GLib C library that is available at run
time; it may be newer than the compile-time version, but should never be
older. These are equivalent to the version variables exported by the
GLib C library. Glib::major_version Glib::minor_version
Glib::micro_version</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Which one do I use when?</h2>
<p>Where do you use which version? It depends entirely on what you're
doing. Let's explain by example:</p>
<dl>
<dt>o Use the Perl module version for bindings support issues</dt>
<dd>
<p>You need to register a new enum for use as the type of an object
property. This is something you can do with all versions of the
underlying C library, but which wasn't supported in the Glib Perl module
until <code>$Glib::VERSION</code> &gt;= 1.040.</p>
</dd>
<dt>o Use the bound version for library features</dt>
<dd>
<p>You want to call Glib::set_application_name to set a human-readable
name for your application (which is used by various parts of Gtk2 and
Gnome2). <strong>g_set_application_name()</strong> (the underlying C
function) was added in version 2.2.0 of glib, and support for it was
introduced into the Glib Perl module in Glib version 1.040. However, you
can build the Perl module against any stable 2.x.x version of glib, so
you might not have that function available even if your Glib module is
new enough! Thus, you need to check two things to see if the this
function is available: if ($Glib::VERSION &gt;= 1.040 &amp;&amp;
Glib-&gt;CHECK_VERSION (2,2,0)) { # its available, and we can call it!
Glib::set_application_name (My Cool Application); } Now what happens if
you installed the Perl module when your system had glib 2.0.6, and you
upgraded glib to 2.4.1? Wouldn't
<strong>g_set_application_name()</strong> be available? Well, it's
there, under the hood, but the bindings were compiled when it wasn't
there, so you won't be able to call it! That's why we check the bound or
compile-time version. By the way, to enable support for the new
function, you'd need to reinstall (or upgrade) the Perl module.</p>
</dd>
<dt>o Use the linked version for runtime work-arounds</dt>
<dd>
<p>Suppose there's a function whose API did not change, but whose
implementation had a bug in one version that was fixed in another
version. To determine whether you need to apply a workaround, you would
check the version that is actually being used at runtime. if
(Glib::major_version == 2 &amp;&amp; Glib::minor_version == 2 &amp;&amp;
Glib::micro_version == 1) { # work around bug that exists only in glib
2.2.1. } In practice, such situations are very rare.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<h2>boolean = Glib-&gt;<strong>CHECK_VERSION</strong> ($required_major,
$required_minor, $required_micro)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$required_major</code> (integer)</p></li>
<li><p><code>$required_minor</code> (integer)</p></li>
<li><p><code>$required_micro</code> (integer)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Provides a mechanism for checking the version information that Glib
was compiled against. Essentially equvilent to the macro
GLIB_CHECK_VERSION.</p>
<h2>(MAJOR, MINOR, MICRO) =
Glib-&gt;<strong>GET_VERSION_INFO</strong></h2>
<p>Shorthand to fetch as a list the glib version for which Glib was
compiled. See <code>Glib::MAJOR_VERSION</code>, etc.</p>
<h2>integer = Glib::MAJOR_VERSION</h2>
<p>Provides access to the version information that Glib was compiled
against. Essentially equivalent to the #define's GLIB_MAJOR_VERSION.</p>
<h2>integer = Glib::MICRO_VERSION</h2>
<p>Provides access to the version information that Glib was compiled
against. Essentially equivalent to the #define's GLIB_MICRO_VERSION.</p>
<h2>integer = Glib::MINOR_VERSION</h2>
<p>Provides access to the version information that Glib was compiled
against. Essentially equivalent to the #define's GLIB_MINOR_VERSION.</p>
<h2>integer = Glib::major_version</h2>
<p>Provides access to the version information that Glib is linked
against. Essentially equivalent to the global variable
glib_major_version.</p>
<h2>integer = Glib::micro_version</h2>
<p>Provides access to the version information that Glib is linked
against. Essentially equivalent to the global variable
glib_micro_version.</p>
<h2>integer = Glib::minor_version</h2>
<p>Provides access to the version information that Glib is linked
against. Essentially equivalent to the global variable
glib_minor_version.</p>
