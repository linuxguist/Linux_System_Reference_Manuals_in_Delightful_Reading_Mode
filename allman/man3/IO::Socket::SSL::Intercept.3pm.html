<p>IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept -- SSL interception (man in the
middle)</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept; # create interceptor with proxy
certificates my $mitm = IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept-&gt;new(
proxy_cert_file =&gt; proxy_cert.pem, proxy_key_file =&gt;

=&gt; .., Listen =&gt; .. ); while (1) { # TCP accept new client my
$client = $listen-&gt;accept or next; # SSL connect to server my $server

... ) or die "ssl connect failed: $!,$SSL_ERROR"; # clone server
certificate my ($cert,$key) = $mitm-&gt;clone_cert(

cloned certificate IO::Socket::SSL-&gt;start_SSL($client, SSL_server
=&gt; 1, SSL_cert =&gt; $cert, SSL_key =&gt; $key ) or die "upgrade

analyze # the unencrypted data ... }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module provides functionality to clone certificates and sign
them with a proxy certificate, thus making it easy to intercept SSL
connections (man in the middle). It also manages a cache of the
generated certificates.</p>
<h1>How Intercepting SSL Works</h1>
<p>Intercepting SSL connections is useful for analyzing encrypted
traffic for security reasons or for testing. It does not break the
end-to-end security of SSL, e.g. a properly written client will notice
the interception unless you explicitly configure the client to trust
your interceptor. Intercepting SSL works the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a new CA certificate, which will be used to sign the
cloned certificates. This proxy CA certificate should be trusted by the
client, or (a properly written client) will throw error messages or deny
the connections because it detected a man in the middle attack. Due to
the way the interception works there no support for client side
certificates is possible. Using openssl such a proxy CA certificate and
private key can be created with: openssl genrsa -out proxy_key.pem 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -key proxy_key.pem -out
proxy_cert.pem # export as PKCS12 for import into browser openssl pkcs12
-export -in proxy_cert.pem -inkey proxy_key.pem -out
proxy_cert.p12</p></li>
<li><p>Configure client to connect to use intercepting proxy or somehow
redirect connections from client to the proxy (e.g. packet filter
redirects, ARP or DNS spoofing etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Accept the TCP connection from the client, e.g. don't do any SSL
handshakes with the client yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish the SSL connection to the server and verify the servers
certificate as usually. Then create a new certificate based on the
original servers certificate, but signed by your proxy CA. This is the
step where IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept helps.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade the TCP connection to the client to SSL using the cloned
certificate from the server. If the client trusts your proxy CA it will
accept the upgrade to SSL.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer data between client and server. While the connections to
client and server are both encrypted with SSL you will read/write the
unencrypted data in your proxy application.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept helps creating the cloned certificate with
the following methods:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$mitm = IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept-&gt;new(%args)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates a new interceptor object. <code>%args</code> should
be</p>
<dl>
<dt>proxy_cert X509 | proxy_cert_file filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the proxy certificate. It can be either given by an X509
object from Net::SSLeays internal representation, or using a file in PEM
format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>proxy_key EVP_PKEY | proxy_key_file filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the key for the proxy certificate. It can be either given by
an EVP_PKEY object from Net::SSLeays internal representation, or using a
file in PEM format. The key should not have a passphrase.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pubkey EVP_PKEY | pubkey_file filename</dt>
<dd>
<p>This optional argument specifies the public key used for the cloned
certificate. It can be either given by an EVP_PKEY object from
Net::SSLeays internal representation, or using a file in PEM format. If
not given it will create a new public key on each call of
<code>new</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>serial INTEGER|CODE</dt>
<dd>
<p>This optional argument gives the starting point for the serial
numbers of the newly created certificates. If not set the serial number
will be created based on the digest of the original certificate. If the
value is code it will be called with
<code>serial(original_cert,CERT_asHash(original_cert))</code> and should
return the new serial number.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cache HASH | SUBROUTINE</dt>
<dd>
<p>This optional argument gives a way to cache created certificates, so
that they don't get recreated on future accesses to the same host. If
the argument ist not given an internal HASH ist used. If the argument is
a hash it will store for each generated certificate a hash reference
with <code>cert</code> and <code>atime</code> in the hash, where
<code>atime</code> is the time of last access (to expire unused entries)
and <code>cert</code> is the certificate. Please note, that the
certificate is in Net::SSLeays internal X509 format and can thus not be
simply dumped and restored. The key for the hash is an
<code>ident</code> either given to <code>clone_cert</code> or generated
from the original certificate. If the argument is a subroutine it will
be called as <code>$cache-&gt;(ident,sub)</code>. This call should
return either an existing (cached) <code>(cert,key)</code> or call
<code>sub</code> without arguments to create a new
<code>(cert,key)</code>, store it and return it. If called with
<code>$cache-&gt;(type)</code> the function should just return 1 to
signal that it supports the current type of cache. If it reutrns nothing
instead the older cache interface is assumed for compatibility
reasons.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>($clone_cert,$key) = $mitm-&gt;clone_cert($original_cert,[ $ident
])</dt>
<dd>
<p>This clones the given certificate. An ident as the key into the cache
can be given (like <code>host:port</code>), if not it will be created
from the properties of the original certificate. It returns the cloned
certificate and its key (which is the same for alle created
certificates).</p>
</dd>
<dt>$string = $mitm-&gt;serialize</dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates a serialized version of the object (e.g. a string) which
can then be used to persistantly store created certificates over
restarts of the application. The cache will only be serialized if it is
a HASH. To work together with Storable the <code>STORABLE_freeze</code>
function is defined to call <code>serialize</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$mitm = IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept-&gt;unserialize($string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This restores an Intercept object from a serialized string. To work
together with Storable the <code>STORABLE_thaw</code> function is
defined to call <code>unserialize</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
