<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>procps - API to access system level information in the /proc
filesystem</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Five distinct interfaces are represented in this synopsis and named
after the files they access in the /proc pseudo filesystem:
<strong>diskstats</strong>, <strong>meminfo</strong>,
<strong>slabinfo</strong>, <strong>stat</strong> and
<strong>vmstat</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;libproc2/named_interface.h&gt;

int procps_new (struct info **info);
int procps_ref (struct info *info);
int procps_unref (struct info **info);

struct result *procps_get (
 struct info *info,
[ const char *name, ] diskstats api only
 enum item item);

struct stack *procps_select (
 struct info *info,
[ const char *name, ] diskstats api only
 enum item *items,
 int numitems);

struct reaped *procps_reap (
 struct info *info,
[ enum reap_type what, ] stat api only
 enum item *items,
 int numitems);

struct stack **procps_sort (
 struct info *info,
 struct stack *stacks[],
 int numstacked,
 enum item sortitem,
 enum sort_order order);
</code></pre>
<p>The above functions and structures are generic but the specific
<strong>named_interface</strong> would also be part of any identifiers.
For example, `procps_new' would actually be
`procps_<strong>meminfo</strong>_new' and `info' would really be
`<strong>diskstats</strong>_info', etc.</p>
<p>The same <strong>named_interface</strong> is used in each header file
name with an appended `.h' suffix.</p>
<p>Link with <em>-lproc2</em>.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Central to these interfaces is a simple `result' structure reflecting
an `item' plus its value (in a union with standard C language types as
members). All `result' structures are automatically allocated and
provided by the library.</p>
<p>By specifying an array of `items', these structures can be organized
as a `stack', potentially yielding many results with a single function
call. Thus, a `stack' can be viewed as a variable length record whose
content and order is determined solely by the user.</p>
<p>As part of each interface there are two unique enumerators. The
`noop' and `extra' items exist to hold user values. They are never set
by the library, but the `extra' result will be zeroed with each library
interaction.</p>
<p>The <strong>named_interface</strong> header file will be an essential
document during user program development. There you will find available
items, their return type (the `result' struct member name) and the
source for such values. Additional enumerators and structures are also
documented there.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The following would be a typical sequence of calls to these
interfaces.</p>
<pre><code>1. procps_new()
2. procps_get(), procps_select() or procps_reap()
3. procps_unref()</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>get</strong> function is used to retrieve a `result'
structure for a single `item'. Alternatively, a <strong>GET</strong>
macro is available when only the return value is of interest.</p>
<p>The <strong>select</strong> function can retrieve multiple `result'
structures in a single `stack'.</p>
<p>For unpredictable variable outcomes, the <strong>diskstats</strong>,
<strong>slabinfo</strong> and <strong>stat</strong> interfaces export a
<strong>reap</strong> function. It is used to retrieve multiple `stacks'
each containing multiple `result' structures. Optionally, a user may
choose to <strong>sort</strong> those results.</p>
<p>To exploit any `stack', and access individual `result' structures, a
<em>relative_enum</em> is required as shown in the <strong>VAL</strong>
macro defined in the header file. Such values could be hard coded as: 0
through numitems-1. However, this need is typically satisfied by
creating your own enumerators corresponding to the order of the `items'
array.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>The <strong>new</strong>, <strong>ref</strong>,
<strong>unref</strong>, <strong>get</strong> and <strong>select</strong>
functions are available in all five interfaces.</p>
<p>For the <strong>new</strong> and <strong>unref</strong> functions,
the address of an <em>info</em> struct pointer must be supplied. With
<strong>new</strong> it must have been initialized to NULL. With
<strong>unref</strong> it will be reset to NULL if the reference count
reaches zero.</p>
<p>In the case of the <strong>diskstats</strong> interface, a
<em>name</em> parameter on the <strong>get</strong> and
<strong>select</strong> functions identifies a disk or partition
name</p>
<p>For the <strong>stat</strong> interface, a <em>what</em> parameter on
the <strong>reap</strong> function identifies whether data for just CPUs
or both CPUs and NUMA nodes is to be gathered.</p>
<p>When using the <strong>sort</strong> function, the parameters
<em>stacks</em> and <em>numstacked</em> would normally be those returned
in the `reaped' structure.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<h2>Functions Returning an `int'</h2>
<p>An error will be indicated by a negative number that is always the
inverse of some well known errno.h value.</p>
<p>Success is indicated by a zero return value. However, the
<strong>ref</strong> and <strong>unref</strong> functions return the
current <em>info</em> structure reference count.</p>
<h2>Functions Returning an `address'</h2>
<p>An error will be indicated by a NULL return pointer with the reason
found in the formal errno value.</p>
<p>Success is indicated by a pointer to the named structure.</p>
<h1>DEBUGGING</h1>
<p>To aid in program development, there is a provision that can help
ensure `result' member references agree with library expectations. It
assumes that a supplied macro in the header file is used to access the
`result' value.</p>
<p>This feature can be activated through either of the following methods
and any discrepancies will be written to <strong>stderr</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Add CFLAGS='-DXTRA_PROCPS_DEBUG' to any other ./configure options
employed.</p></li>
<li><p>Add #include &lt;procps/xtra-procps-debug.h&gt; to any program
<em>after</em> the named interface includes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This verification feature incurs substantial overhead. Therefore, it
is important that it <em>not</em> be activated for a production/release
build.</p>
