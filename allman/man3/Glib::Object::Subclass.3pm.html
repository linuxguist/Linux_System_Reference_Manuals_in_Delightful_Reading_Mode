<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Glib::Object::Subclass - register a perl class as a GObject class</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Glib::Object::Subclass Some::Base::Class::, # parent class,
derived from Glib::Object signals =&gt; { something_changed =&gt; {
class_closure =&gt; sub { do_something_fun () }, flags =&gt;
[qw(run-first)], return_type =&gt; undef, param_types =&gt; [], },
some_existing_signal =&gt; \&amp;class_closure_override, }, properties
=&gt; [ Glib::ParamSpec-&gt;string ( some_string, Some String Property,
This property is a string that is used as an example, default value,
[qw/readable writable/] ), ];</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module allows you to create your own GObject classes, which is
useful to e.g. implement your own Gtk2 widgets.</p>
<p>It doesn't export anything into your namespace, but acts more like a
pragmatic module that modifies your class to make it work as a GObject
class.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why you can't just bless a Glib::Object into a
different package and add some subs. Well, if you aren't interested in
object parameters, signals, or having your new class interoperate
transparently with other GObject-based modules (e.g., Gtk2 and friends),
then you can just re-bless.</p>
<p>However, a GObject's signals, properties, virtual functions, and
GInterface implementations are specific to its GObjectClass. If you want
to create a new GObject which was a derivative of GtkDrawingArea, but
adds a new signal, you must create a new GObjectClass to which to add
the new signal. If you don't, then <em>all</em> of the GtkDrawingAreas
in your application will get that new signal!</p>
<p>Thus, the only way to create a new signal or object property in the
Perl bindings for Glib is to register a new subclass with the GLib type
system via <strong>Glib::Type::register_object()</strong>. The
Glib::Object::Subclass module is a Perl-developer-friendly interface to
this bit of paradigm mismatch.</p>
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<p>This module works similar to the <code>use base</code> pragma in that
it registers the current package as a subclass of some other class
(which must be a GObjectClass implemented either in C or some other
language).</p>
<p>The pragma requires at least one argument, the parent class name. The
remaining arguments are key/value pairs, in any order, all optional:</p>
<dl>
<dt>- properties =&gt; []</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add object properties; see PROPERTIES.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- signals =&gt; {}</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add or override signals; see SIGNALS and OVERRIDING BASE METHODS.</p>
</dd>
<dt>- interfaces =&gt; []</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add GInterfaces to your class; see INTERFACES.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Actually, these parameters are all passed straight through to
<strong>Glib::Type::register_object()</strong>, adding _ _PACKAGE_ _
(the current package name) as the name of the new child class.)</p>
<h2>OBJECT METHODS AND FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>The following methods are either added to your class on request (not
yet implemented), or by default unless your own class implements them
itself. This means that all these methods and functions will get
sensible default implementations unless explicitly overwritten by you
(by defining your own version).</p>
<p>Except for <code>new</code>, all of the following are
<em>functions</em> and no <em>methods</em>. That means that you should
<em>not</em> call the superclass method. Instead, the GObject system
will call these functions per class as required, emulating normal
inheritance.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$class-&gt;new (attr =&gt; value, ...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The default constructor just calls <code>Glib::Object::new</code>,
which allows you to set properties on the newly created object. This is
done because many <code>new</code> methods inherited by Gtk2 or other
libraries don't have <code>new</code> methods suitable for
subclassing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>INIT_INSTANCE $self [not a method]</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>INIT_INSTANCE</code> is called on each class in the hierarchy
as the object is being created (i.e., from
<code>Glib::Object::new</code> or our default <code>new</code>). Use
this function to initialize any member data. The default implementation
will leave the object untouched.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GET_PROPERTY $self, $pspec [not a method]</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>SET_PROPERTY $self, $pspec, $newval [not a method]</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p><code>GET_PROPERTY</code> and <code>SET_PROPERTY</code> are called
whenever somebody does <code>$object-&gt;get ($propname)</code> or
<code>$object-&gt;set ($propname =&gt; $newval)</code> (from other
languages, too). The default implementations hold property values in the
object hash, equivalent to sub GET_PROPERTY { my ($self, $pspec) = @_;
my $pname = $pspec-&gt;get_name; return (exists $self-&gt;{$pname} ?
$self-&gt;{$pname} : $pspec-&gt;get_default_value); # until set } sub
SET_PROPERTY { my ($self, $pspec, $newval) = @_;
$self-&gt;{$pspec-&gt;get_name} = $newval; } Because
<code>$pspec-&gt;get_name</code> converts hyphens to underscores, a
property <code>"line-style"</code> is in the hash as
<code>line_style</code>. These methods let you store/fetch properties in
any way you need to. They don't have to be in the hash, you can
calculate something, read a file, whatever. Most often you'll write your
own <code>SET_PROPERTY</code> so you can take action when a property
changes, like redraw or resize a widget. Eg. sub SET_PROPERTY { my
($self, $pspec, $newval) = @_; my $pname = $pspec-&gt;get_name
$self-&gt;{$pname} = $newval; # ready for default GET_PROPERTY if
($pname eq line_style) { $self-&gt;queue_draw; # redraw with new lines }
} Care must be taken with boxed non-reference-counted types such as
<code>Gtk2::Gdk::Color</code>. In <code>SET_PROPERTY</code> the
<code>$newval</code> is generally good only for the duration of the
call. Use <code>copy</code> or similar if keeping it longer (see
Glib::Boxed). In <code>GET_PROPERTY</code> the returned memory must last
long enough to reach the caller, which generally means returning a
field, not a newly created object (which is destroyed with the scalar
holding it). <code>GET_PROPERTY</code> is different from a C
get_property method in that the perl method returns the retrieved value.
For symmetry, the <code>$newval</code> and <code>$pspec</code> args on
<code>SET_PROPERTY</code> are swapped from the C usage.</p>
<dl>
<dt>FINALIZE_INSTANCE $self [not a method]</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>FINALIZE_INSTANCE</code> is called as the GObject is being
finalized, that is, as it is being really destroyed. This is independent
of the more common DESTROY on the perl object; in fact, you must
<em>NOT</em> override <code>DESTROY</code> (it's not useful to you, in
any case, as it is being called multiple times!). Use this hook to
release anything you have to clean up manually. FINALIZE_INSTANCE will
be called for each perl instance, in reverse order of construction. The
default finalizer does nothing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$object-&gt;DESTROY [DO NOT OVERWRITE]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Don't <em>ever</em> overwrite <code>DESTROY</code>, use
<code>FINALIZE_INSTANCE</code> instead. The DESTROY method of all perl
classes derived from GTypes is implemented in the Glib module and
(ab-)used for its own internal purposes. Overwriting it is not useful as
it will be called <em>multiple</em> times, and often long before the
object actually gets destroyed. Overwriting might be very harmful to
your program, so <em>never</em> do that. Especially watch out for other
classes in your ISA tree.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>PROPERTIES</h1>
<p>To create gobject properties, supply a list of Glib::ParamSpec
objects as the value for the key 'properties'. There are lots of
different paramspec constructors, documented in the C API reference's
Parameters and Values page, as well as Glib::ParamSpec.</p>
<p>As of Glib 1.060, you can also specify explicit getters and setters
for your properties at creation time. The default values in your
properties are also honored if you don't set anything else. See
Glib::Type::register_object in Glib::Type for an example.</p>
<h1>SIGNALS</h1>
<p>Creating new signals for your new object is easy. Just provide a hash
of signal names and signal descriptions under the key 'signals'. Each
signal description is also a hash, with a few expected keys. All the
keys are allowed to default.</p>
<dl>
<dt>flags =&gt; GSignalFlags</dt>
<dd>
<p>If not present, assumed to be 'run-first'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>param_types =&gt; reference to a list of package names</dt>
<dd>
<p>If not present, assumed to be empty (no parameters).</p>
</dd>
<dt>class_closure =&gt; reference to a subroutine to call as the class
closure.</dt>
<dd>
<p>may also be a string interpreted as the name of a subroutine to call,
but you should be very very very careful about that. If not present, the
library will attempt to call the method named do_signal_name for the
signal signal_name (uses underscores). You'll want to be careful not to
let this handler method be a publically callable method, or one that has
the name name as something that emits the signal. Due to the funky ways
in which Glib is different from Perl, the class closures <em>should
not</em> inherit through normal perl inheritance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>return_type =&gt; package name for return value.</dt>
<dd>
<p>If undefined or not present, the signal expects no return value. if
defined, the signal is expected to return a value; flags must be set
such that the signal does not run only first (at least use
'run-last').</p>
</dd>
<dt>accumulator =&gt; signal return value accumulator</dt>
<dd>
<p>quoting the Glib manual: The signal accumulator is a special callback
function that can be used to collect return values of the various
callbacks that are called during a signal emission. If not specified,
the default accumulator is used, and you just get the return value of
the last handler to run. Accumulators are not really documented very
much in the C reference, and the perl interface here is slightly
different, so here's an inordinate amount of detail for this arcane
feature: The accumulator function is called for every handler as ($cont,
$acc) = &amp;$func ($invocation_hint, $acc, $ret)
<code>$invocation_hint</code> is an anonymous hash (including the signal
name); <code>$acc</code> is the current accumulated return value;
<code>$ret</code> is the value from the most recent handler. The two
return values are a boolean <code>$cont</code> for whether signal
emission should continue (false to stop); and a new <code>$acc</code>
accumulated return value. (This is different from the C version, which
writes through a return_accu.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>OVERRIDING BASE METHODS</h1>
<p>GLib pulls some fancy tricks with function pointers to implement
methods in C. This is not very language-binding-friendly, as you might
guess.</p>
<p>However, as described above, every signal allows a class closure; you
may override the class closure with your own function, and you can chain
from the overridden method to the original. This serves to implement
virtual overrides for language bindings.</p>
<p>So, to override a method, you supply a subroutine reference instead
of a signal description hash as the value for the name of the existing
signal in the signals hash described in SIGNALS.</p>
<p># override some important widget methods: use Glib::Object::Subclass
Gtk2::Widget::, signals =&gt; { expose_event =&gt; \&amp;expose_event,
configure_event =&gt; \&amp;configure_event, button_press_event =&gt;
\&amp;button_press_event, button_release_event =&gt;
\&amp;button_release_event, motion_notify_event =&gt;
\&amp;motion_notify_event, # note the choice of names here... see the
discussion. size_request =&gt; \&amp;do_size_request, }</p>
<p>It's important to note that the handlers you supply for these are
class-specific, and that normal perl method inheritance rules are not
followed to invoke them from within the library. However, perl code can
still find them! Therefore it's rather important that you choose your
handlers' names carefully, avoiding any public interfaces that you might
call from perl. Case in point, since size_request is a widget method, i
chose do_size_request as the override handler.</p>
<h1>INTERFACES</h1>
<p>GObject supports only single inheritance; in place of multiple
inheritance, GObject uses GInterfaces. In the Perl bindings we have
mostly masqueraded this with multiple inheritance (that is, simply
adding the GInterface class to the <code>@ISA</code> of the implementing
class), but in deriving new objects the facade breaks and the magic
leaks out.</p>
<p>In order to derive an object that implements a GInterface, you have
to tell the GLib type system you want your class to include a
GInterface. To do this, simply pass a list of package names through the
interfaces key; this will add these packages to your <code>@ISA</code>,
and cause perl to invoke methods that you must provide.</p>
<p>package Mup::MultilineEntry; use Glib::Object::Subclass
Gtk2::TextView, interfaces =&gt; [ Gtk2::CellEditable ], ; # perl will
now invoke these methods, which are part of the # GtkCellEditable
GInterface, when somebody invokes the # corresponding lower-case methods
on your objects. sub START_EDITING { warn "start editing\n"; } sub
EDITING_DONE { warn "editing done\n"; } sub REMOVE_WIDGET { warn "remove
widget\n"; }</p>
