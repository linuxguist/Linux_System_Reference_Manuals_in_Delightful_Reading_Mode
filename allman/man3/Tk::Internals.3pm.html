<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::Internals - what is Perl Tk interface doing when you call Tk
functions.</p>
<p>This information is worse than useless for "perlTk" users, but can of
some help for people interested in using modified Tk source with
"perlTk".</p>
<p>This document is under construction. The information is believed to
be pertinent to the version of "portableTk" available when it was
created. All the details are subject to change.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<dl>
<dt>PreCompiling</dt>
<dd>
<p>Before the actual compilation stage a script scans the source and
extracts the subcommands of different commands. This information resides
in the file <code>pTk/Methods.def</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Compilation</dt>
<dd>
<p>During compilation the above file is included in the source of
booting routine of dynamic (or static) library. More precisely, the
booting code of module <code>Tk</code> calls the subroutine
<strong>Boot_Glue()</strong> from the module <code>tkGlue.c</code>, and
this subroutine includes the file (with appropriate macro
definitions).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inside "use Tk;"</dt>
<dd>
<p>The module bootstraps the C code, then loads the Perl libraries. The
heart of the Perl code is contained in the <code>Tk::Widget</code>
library, all the widgets inherit from this module. Code for toplevels is
loaded from <code>Tk::MainWindow</code>. During bootstrap of the C glue
code the <code>Xevent::?</code> codes and a handful of
<code>Tk::Widget</code> and <code>Tk::Image</code> routines are defined.
(Much more XSUBs are created from <code>Tk.xs</code> code.) The widget
subcommands are glued to Perl basing on the list included from
<code>pTk/Methods.def</code>. In fact all the subcommands are glued to
XSUBs that are related to the same C subroutine
<strong>XStoWidget()</strong>, but have different data parts. During the
Perl code bootstrap the method <code>Tk::Widget::import</code> is
called. This call requires all the code from particular widget packages.
Code from the widget packages calls an obscure command like (bless
\"Text")-&gt;WidgetClass; This command (actually
<strong>Tk::Widget::WidgetClass()</strong>) creates three routines:
<strong>Tk::Widget::Text()</strong>,
<strong>Tk::Widget::isText()</strong>, and
<strong>Tk::Text::isText()</strong>. The first one is basically
<code>new</code> of <code>Tk::Text</code>, the other two return
constants. It also puts the class into depository.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inside "$top = MainWindow-&gt;new;"</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is quite intuitive. This call goes direct to
<code>Tk::MainWindow::new</code>, that calls XSUB
<code>Tk::MainWindow::CreateMainWindow</code>, that calls C subroutine
<strong>Tk_CreateMainWindow()</strong>. It is a <code>Tk</code>
subroutine, so here black magic ends (almost). The only remaining black
magic is that the <code>Tk</code> initialization routine creates a lot
of commands, but the subroutine for creation is usurped by
<strong>portableTk</strong> and the commands are created in the package
<code>Tk</code>. They are associated to XSUBs that are related to one of
three C subroutines <strong>XStoSubCmd()</strong>,
<strong>XStoBind()</strong>, or <strong>XStoTk()</strong>, but have
different data parts. The result of the call is blessed into
<code>Tk::MainWindow</code>, as it should.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inside "$top-&gt;title(Text demo);"</dt>
<dd>
<p>The package <code>Tk::Toplevel</code> defines a lot of subroutines on
the fly on some list. All the commands from the list are converted to
the corresponding subcommands of <code>wm</code> method of the widget.
Here subcommand is a command with some particular second argument (in
this case <code>"title"</code>). Recall that the first argument is
<code>$self</code>. Now <code>Tk::Toplevel</code> <code>@ISA</code>
<code>Tk::Widget</code>, that in turn <code>@ISA</code> <code>Tk</code>.
So a call to <code>$top-&gt;wm(title,Text demo)</code> calls
<code>Tk::wm</code>, that is defined during call to
<strong>Tk_CreateMainWindow()</strong>. As it is described above, the
XSUB associated to <strong>XStoSubCmd()</strong> is called. This C
routine is defined in <code>tkGlue.c</code>. It gets the data part of
XSUB, creates a <code>SV</code> with the name of the command, and calls
<strong>Call_Tk()</strong> with the XSUB data as the first argument, and
with the name of XSUB stuffed into the Perl stack in the place there
<code>tk</code> expects it. (In fact it can also reorder the arguments
if it thinks it is what you want). The latter procedure extracts name of
<code>tk</code> procedure and <code>clientData</code> from the first
argument and makes a call, using Perl stack as <code>argv</code> for the
procedure. A lot of black magic is performed afterwards to convert
result of the procedure to a Perl array return.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inside "$text = $top-&gt;Text(background =&gt; $txtBg);"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Above we discussed how the command <code>Tk::Widget::Text</code> is
created. The above command calls it via inheritance. It is translated to
Tk::Text::new($top, background =&gt; $txtBg); The package
<code>Tk::Text</code> has no method <code>new</code>, so the
<code>Tk::Widget::new</code> is called. In turn it calls
<code>Tk::Text-&gt;DoInit($top)</code>, that is
<code>Tk::Widget::DoInit(Tk::Text,$top)</code>, that initializes the
bindings if necessary. Then it creates the name for the widget of the
form <code>.text0</code>, and calls
<code>Tk::text(.text0, background =&gt; $txtBg)</code> (note lowercase).
The result of the call is blessed into <code>Tk::Text</code>, and the
method <code>bindtags</code> for this object is called. Now the only
thing to discuss is who defines the methods <code>text</code> and
<code>bindtags</code>. The answer is that they are defined in
<code>tkWindow.c</code>, and these commands are created in the package
<code>Tk</code> in the same sweep that created the command
<code>Tk::wm</code> discussed above. So the the same C code that
corresponds to the processing of corresponding TCL commands is called
here as well (this time via <code>XStoTk</code> interface).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inside "$text-&gt;insert(insert,Hello, world!);"</dt>
<dd>
<p>As we discussed above, the subcommands of widget procedures
correspond to XSUB <code>XStoWidget</code>. This XSUB substitutes the
first argument <code>$text</code> (that is a hash reference) to an
appropriate value from this hash, adds the additional argument after the
first one that contains the name of the subcommand extracted from the
data part of XSUB, and calls the corresponding Tk C subroutine via
<code>Call_Tk</code>.</p>
