<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::after - Execute a command after a time delay</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>  <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>after</strong>(<em>ms</em>)</p>
<p>  <em><code>$id</code></em> =
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>after</strong>(<em>ms</em>?,<em>callback</em>?)</p>
<p>  <em><code>$id</code></em> =
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>repeat</strong>(<em>ms</em>?,<em>callback</em>?)</p>
<p>  <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>afterCancel</strong>(<em><code>$id</code></em>)</p>
<p>  <em><code>$id</code></em> =
<em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>afterIdle</strong>(<em>callback</em>)</p>
<p>  <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>afterInfo</strong>?(<em><code>$id</code></em>)?</p>
<p>  <em><code>$id</code></em>-&gt;<strong>time</strong>(?<em>delay</em>?)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This method is used to delay execution of the program or to execute a
callback in background sometime in the future.</p>
<p>In perl/Tk <em><code>$widget</code></em>-&gt;<strong>after</strong>
is implemented via the class <code>Tk::After</code>, and callbacks are
associated with <em><code>$widget</code></em>, and are automatically
cancelled when the widget is destroyed. An almost identical interface,
but without automatic cancel, and without repeat is provided via
Tk::after method.</p>
<h2>Internal Details</h2>
<p>The internal Tk::After class has the following synopsis:</p>
<p>$id = Tk::After-&gt;new($widget, tid, $time, once, callback); $id =
Tk::After-&gt;new($widget, tid, $time, repeat, callback);
$id-&gt;cancel; $id-&gt;time(?delay?);</p>
<p><code>$id</code> is a Tk::After object, an array of 5 elements:</p>
<p><em><code>$widget</code></em> is the parent widget reference.</p>
<p><em>tid</em> is the internal timer id, a unique string.</p>
<p><em><code>$time</code></em> is the string 'idle', representing an
idle queue timer, or a integer millisecond value.</p>
<p><em>once</em> or <em>repeat</em> specifies whether the timer is a
one-time <strong>after</strong> event, or a repeating
<strong>repeat</strong> event.</p>
<p><em>callback</em> specifies a Perl/Tk Tk::Callback object.</p>
<h1>Changing a <strong>repeat</strong> timer interval</h1>
<p>It's possible to change a <strong>repeat</strong> timer's delay
value, or even cancel any timer, using the <strong>time</strong> method.
If <em>delay</em> is specified and non-zero, a new timer delay is
established. If <em>delay</em> is zero the timer event is canceled just
as if <em><code>$id</code></em>-&gt;<strong>cancel</strong> were
invoked. In all cases the current millisecond timer delay is
returned.</p>
<p>Note: the new timer delay will take effect on the <em>subsequent</em>
timer event - this command will not cancel the pending timer event and
re-issue it with the new delay time.</p>
<h1>The <strong>after()</strong> method has several forms as
follows:</h1>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;after(ms)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value <em>ms</em> must be an integer giving a time in
milliseconds. The command sleeps for <em>ms</em> milliseconds and then
returns. While the command is sleeping the application does not respond
to events.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;after(ms,callback)</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form the command returns immediately, but it arranges for
<em>callback</em> be executed <em>ms</em> milliseconds later as an event
handler. The callback will be executed exactly once, at the given time.
The command will be executed in context of
<em><code>$widget</code></em>. If an error occurs while executing the
delayed command then the Tk::Error mechanism is used to report the
error. The <strong>after</strong> command returns an identifier (an
object in the perl/Tk case) that can be used to cancel the delayed
command using <strong>afterCancel</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;repeat(ms,callback)</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form the command returns immediately, but it arranges for
<em>callback</em> be executed <em>ms</em> milliseconds later as an event
handler. After <em>callback</em> has executed it is re-scheduled, to be
executed in a futher <em>ms</em>, and so on until it is cancelled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;afterCancel($id)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>$id-&gt;cancel</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cancels the execution of a delayed command that was previously
scheduled. <em><code>$id</code></em> indicates which command should be
canceled; it must have been the return value from a previous
<strong>after</strong> command. If the command given by
<em><code>$id</code></em> has already been executed (and is not
scheduled to be executed again) then <strong>afterCancel</strong> has no
effect.</p>
<dl>
<dt>$widget-&gt;afterCancel(callback)</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>This form is not robust in perl/Tk - its use is deprecated.</em>
This command should also cancel the execution of a delayed command. The
<em>callback</em> argument is compared with pending callbacks, if a
match is found, that callback is cancelled and will never be executed;
if no such callback is currently pending then the
<strong>afterCancel</strong> has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;afterIdle(callback)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arranges for <em>callback</em> to be evaluated later as an idle
callback. The script will be run exactly once, the next time the event
loop is entered and there are no events to process. The command returns
an identifier that can be used to cancel the delayed command using
<strong>afterCancel</strong>. If an error occurs while executing the
script then the Tk::Error mechanism is used to report the error.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$widget-&gt;afterInfo?($id)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command returns information about existing event handlers. If no
<em><code>$id</code></em> argument is supplied, the command returns a
list of the identifiers for all existing event handlers created by the
<strong>after</strong> and <strong>repeat</strong> commands for
<em><code>$widget</code></em>. If <em><code>$id</code></em> is supplied,
it specifies an existing handler; <em><code>$id</code></em> must have
been the return value from some previous call to <strong>after</strong>
or <strong>repeat</strong> and it must not have triggered yet or been
cancelled. In this case the command returns a list with three elements.
The first element of the list is the callback associated with
<em><code>$id</code></em>, the second element is either
<strong>idle</strong> or the <em>integer</em> timer millisecond value to
indicate what kind of event handler it is, and the third is a string
<em>once</em> or <em>repeat</em> to differentiate an
<strong>after</strong> from a <strong>repeat</strong> event.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>after</strong>(<em>ms</em>) and
<strong>afterIdle</strong> forms of the command assume that the
application is event driven: the delayed commands will not be executed
unless the application enters the event loop. In applications that are
not normally event-driven, the event loop can be entered with the
<strong>vwait</strong> and <strong>update</strong> commands.</p>
