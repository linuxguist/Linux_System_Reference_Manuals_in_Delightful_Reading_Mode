<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>URI::Heuristic - Expand URI using heuristics</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use URI::Heuristic qw(uf_uristr); $u = uf_uristr("example"); #
http://www.example.com $u = uf_uristr("www.sol.no/sol"); #
http://www.sol.no/sol $u = uf_uristr("aas"); # http://www.aas.no $u =
uf_uristr("ftp.funet.fi"); # ftp://ftp.funet.fi $u =
uf_uristr("/etc/passwd"); # file:/etc/passwd</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module provides functions that expand strings into real absolute
URIs using some built-in heuristics. Strings that already represent
absolute URIs (i.e. that start with a <code>scheme:</code> part) are
never modified and are returned unchanged. The main use of these
functions is to allow abbreviated URIs similar to what many web browsers
allow for URIs typed in by the user.</p>
<p>The following functions are provided:</p>
<dl>
<dt>uf_uristr($str)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tries to make the argument string into a proper absolute URI string.
The uf_ prefix stands for User Friendly. Under MacOS, it assumes that
any string with a common URL scheme (http, ftp, etc.) is a URL rather
than a local path. So don't name your volumes after common URL schemes
and expect <strong>uf_uristr()</strong> to construct valid file: URL's
on those volumes for you, because it won't.</p>
</dd>
<dt>uf_uri($str)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Works the same way as <strong>uf_uristr()</strong> but returns a
<code>URI</code> object.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>If the hostname portion of a URI does not contain any dots, then
certain qualified guesses are made. These guesses are governed by the
following environment variables:</p>
<dl>
<dt>COUNTRY</dt>
<dd>
<p>The two-letter country code (ISO 3166) for your location. If the
domain name of your host ends with two letters, then it is taken to be
the default country. See also Locale::Country.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LANG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If COUNTRY is not set, these standard environment variables are
examined and country (not language) information possibly found in them
is used as the default country.</p>
</dd>
<dt>URL_GUESS_PATTERN</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains a space-separated list of URL patterns to try. The string
ACME is for some reason used as a placeholder for the host name in the
URL provided. Example: URL_GUESS_PATTERN="www.ACME.no www.ACME.se
www.ACME.com" export URL_GUESS_PATTERN Specifying URL_GUESS_PATTERN
disables any guessing rules based on country. An empty URL_GUESS_PATTERN
disables any guessing that involves host name lookups.</p>
</dd>
