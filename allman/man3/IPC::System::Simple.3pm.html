<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>IPC::System::Simple - Run commands simply, with detailed
diagnostics</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(system systemx capture capturex);
system("some_command"); # Command succeeds or dies!
system("some_command",@args); # Succeeds or dies, avoids shell if @args
systemx("some_command",@args); # Succeeds or dies, NEVER uses the shell
# Capture the output of a command (just like backticks). Dies on error.
my $output = capture("some_command"); # Just like backticks in list
context. Dies on error. my @output = capture("some_command"); # As
above, but avoids the shell if @args is non-empty my $output =
capture("some_command", @args); # As above, but NEVER invokes the shell.
my $output = capturex("some_command", @args); my @output =
capturex("some_command", @args);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Calling Perl's in-built <code>system()</code> function is easy,
determining if it was successful is <em>hard</em>. Let's face it,
<code>$?</code> isn't the nicest variable in the world to play with, and
even if you <em>do</em> check it, producing a well-formatted error
string takes a lot of work.</p>
<p><code>IPC::System::Simple</code> takes the hard work out of calling
external commands. In fact, if you want to be really lazy, you can just
write:</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);</p>
<p>and all of your <code>system</code> commands will either succeed (run
to completion and return a zero exit value), or die with rich diagnostic
messages.</p>
<p>The <code>IPC::System::Simple</code> module also provides a simple
replacement to Perl's backticks operator. Simply write:</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture);</p>
<p>and then use the <strong>capture()</strong> command just like you'd
use backticks. If there's an error, it will die with a detailed
description of what went wrong. Better still, you can even use
<code>capturex()</code> to run the equivalent of backticks, but without
the shell:</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(capturex); my $result = capturex($command,
@args);</p>
<p>If you want more power than the basic interface, including the
ability to specify which exit values are acceptable, trap errors, or
process diagnostics, then read on!</p>
<h1>ADVANCED SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw( capture capturex system systemx run runx
$EXITVAL EXIT_ANY ); # Run a command, throwing exception on failure
run("some_command"); runx("some_command",@args); # Run a command,
avoiding the shell # Do the same thing, but with the drop-in system
replacement. system("some_command"); systemx("some_command", @args); #
Run a command which must return 0..5, avoid the shell, and get the #
exit value (we could also look at $EXITVAL) my $exit_value =
runx([0..5], "some_command", @args); # The same, but any exit value will
do. my $exit_value = runx(EXIT_ANY, "some_command", @args); # Capture
output into $result and throw exception on failure my $result =
capture("some_command"); # Check exit value from captured command print
"some_command exited with status $EXITVAL\n"; # Captures into @lines,
splitting on $/ my @lines = capture("some_command"); # Run a command
which must return 0..5, capture the output into # @lines, and avoid the
shell. my @lines = capturex([0..5], "some_command", @args);</p>
<h1>ADVANCED USAGE</h1>
<h2><strong>run()</strong> and <strong>system()</strong></h2>
<p><code>IPC::System::Simple</code> provides a subroutine called
<code>run</code>, that executes a command using the same semantics as
Perl's built-in <code>system</code>:</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(run); run("cat *.txt"); # Execute command
via the shell run("cat","/etc/motd"); # Execute command without
shell</p>
<p>The primary difference between Perl's in-built system and the
<code>run</code> command is that <code>run</code> will throw an
exception on failure, and allows a list of acceptable exit values to be
set. See Exit values for further information.</p>
<p>In fact, you can even have <code>IPC::System::Simple</code> replace
the default <code>system</code> function for your package so it has the
same behaviour:</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(system); system("cat *.txt"); # system now
succeeds or dies!</p>
<p><code>system</code> and <code>run</code> are aliases to each
other.</p>
<p>See also <strong>runx()</strong>, <strong>systemx()</strong> and
<strong>capturex()</strong> for variants of <code>system()</code> and
<code>run()</code> that never invoke the shell, even with a single
argument.</p>
<h2><strong>capture()</strong></h2>
<p>A second subroutine, named <code>capture</code> executes a command
with the same semantics as Perl's built-in backticks (and
<code>qx()</code>):</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture); # Capture text while invoking
the shell. my $file = capture("cat /etc/motd"); my @lines = capture("cat
/etc/passwd");</p>
<p>However unlike regular backticks, which always use the shell,
<code>capture</code> will bypass the shell when called with multiple
arguments:</p>
<p># Capture text while avoiding the shell. my $file = capture("cat",
"/etc/motd"); my @lines = capture("cat", "/etc/passwd");</p>
<p>See also <strong>runx()</strong>, <strong>systemx()</strong> and
<strong>capturex()</strong> for a variant of <code>capture()</code> that
never invokes the shell, even with a single argument.</p>
<h2><strong>runx()</strong>, <strong>systemx()</strong> and
<strong>capturex()</strong></h2>
<p>The <code>runx()</code>, <code>systemx()</code> and
<code>capturex()</code> commands are identical to the multi-argument
forms of <code>run()</code>, <code>system()</code> and
<code>capture()</code> respectively, but <em>never</em> invoke the
shell, even when called with a single argument. These forms are
particularly useful when a command's argument list <em>might</em> be
empty, for example:</p>
<p>systemx($cmd, @args);</p>
<p>The use of <code>systemx()</code> here guarantees that the shell will
<em>never</em> be invoked, even if <code>@args</code> is empty.</p>
<h2>Exception handling</h2>
<p>In the case where the command returns an unexpected status, both
<code>run</code> and <code>capture</code> will throw an exception, which
if not caught will terminate your program with an error.</p>
<p>Capturing the exception is easy:</p>
<p>eval { run("cat *.txt"); }; if ($@) { print "Something went wrong -
$@\n"; }</p>
<p>See the diagnostics section below for more details.</p>
<p><em>Exception cases</em></p>
<p><code>IPC::System::Simple</code> considers the following to be
unexpected, and worthy of exception:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Failing to start entirely (eg, command not found, permission
denied).</p></li>
<li><p>Returning an exit value other than zero (but see below).</p></li>
<li><p>Being killed by a signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Being passed tainted data (in taint mode).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Exit values</h2>
<p>Traditionally, system commands return a zero status for success and a
non-zero status for failure. <code>IPC::System::Simple</code> will
default to throwing an exception if a non-zero exit value is
returned.</p>
<p>You may specify a range of values which are considered acceptable
exit values by passing an <em>array reference</em> as the first
argument. The special constant <code>EXIT_ANY</code> can be used to
allow <em>any</em> exit value to be returned.</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(run system capture EXIT_ANY); run( [0..5],
"cat *.txt"); # Exit values 0-5 are OK system( [0..5], "cat *.txt"); #
This works the same way my @lines = capture( EXIT_ANY, "cat *.txt"); #
Any exit is fine.</p>
<p>The <code>run</code> and replacement <code>system</code> subroutines
returns the exit value of the process:</p>
<p>my $exit_value = run( [0..5], "cat *.txt"); # OR: my $exit_value =
system( [0..5] "cat *.txt"); print "Program exited with value
$exit_value\n";</p>
<p><em><code>$EXITVAL</code></em></p>
<p>The exit value of any command executed by
<code>IPC::System::Simple</code> can always be retrieved from the
<code>$IPC::System::Simple::EXITVAL</code> variable:</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when inspecting results from
<code>capture</code>, which returns the captured text from the
command.</p>
<p>use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture $EXITVAL EXIT_ANY); my
@enemies_defeated = capture(EXIT_ANY, "defeat_evil", "/dev/mordor");
print "Program exited with value $EXITVAL\n";</p>
<p><code>$EXITVAL</code> will be set to <code>-1</code> if the command
did not exit normally (eg, being terminated by a signal) or did not
start. In this situation an exception will also be thrown.</p>
<h2>WINDOWS-SPECIFIC NOTES</h2>
<p>The <code>run</code> subroutine make available the full 32-bit exit
value on Win32 systems. This has been true since
<code>IPC::System::Simple</code> v0.06 when called with multiple
arguments, and since v1.25 when called with a single argument. This is
different from the previous versions of <code>IPC::System::Simple</code>
and from Perl's in-build <code>system()</code> function, which can only
handle 8-bit return values.</p>
<p>The <code>capture</code> subroutine always returns the 32-bit exit
value under Windows. The <code>capture</code> subroutine also never uses
the shell, even when passed a single argument.</p>
<p>The <code>run</code> subroutine always uses a shell when passed a
single argument. On NT systems, it uses <code>cmd.exe</code> in the
system root, and on non-NT systems it uses <code>command.com</code> in
the system root.</p>
<p>As of <code>IPC::System::Simple</code> v1.25, the <code>runx</code>
and <code>capturex</code> subroutines, as well as multiple-argument
calls to the <code>run</code> and <code>capture</code> subroutines, have
their arguments properly quoted, so that arugments with spaces and the
like work properly. Unfortunately, this breaks any attempt to invoke the
shell itself. If you really need to execute <code>cmd.exe</code> or
<code>command.com</code>, use the single-argument form. For
single-argument calls to <code>run</code> and <code>capture</code>, the
argument must be properly shell-quoted in advance of the call.</p>
<p>Versions of <code>IPC::System::Simple</code> before v0.09 would not
search the <code>PATH</code> environment variable when the
multi-argument form of <code>run()</code> was called. Versions from
v0.09 onwards correctly search the path provided the command is provided
including the extension (eg, <code>notepad.exe</code> rather than just
<code>notepad</code>, or <code>gvim.bat</code> rather than just
<code>gvim</code>). If no extension is provided, <code>.exe</code> is
assumed.</p>
<p>Signals are not supported on Windows systems. Sending a signal to a
Windows process will usually cause it to exit with the signal number
used.</p>
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>"%s" failed to start: "%s"</dt>
<dd>
<p>The command specified did not even start. It may not exist, or you
may not have permission to use it. The reason it could not start (as
determined from <code>$!</code>) will be provided.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"%s" unexpectedly returned exit value %d</dt>
<dd>
<p>The command ran successfully, but returned an exit value we did not
expect. The value returned is reported.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"%s" died to signal "%s" (%d) %s</dt>
<dd>
<p>The command was killed by a signal. The name of the signal will be
reported, or <code>UNKNOWN</code> if it cannot be determined. The signal
number is always reported. If we detected that the process dumped core,
then the string <code>and dumped core</code> is appended.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IPC::System::Simple::%s called with no arguments</dt>
<dd>
<p>You attempted to call <code>run</code> or <code>capture</code> but
did not provide any arguments at all. At the very lease you need to
supply a command to run.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IPC::System::Simple::%s called with no command</dt>
<dd>
<p>You called <code>run</code> or <code>capture</code> with a list of
acceptable exit values, but no actual command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IPC::System::Simple::%s called with tainted argument "%s"</dt>
<dd>
<p>You called <code>run</code> or <code>capture</code> with tainted
(untrusted) arguments, which is almost certainly a bad idea. To untaint
your arguments you'll need to pass your data through a regular
expression and use the resulting match variables. See Laundering and
Detecting Tainted Data in perlsec for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IPC::System::Simple::%s called with tainted environment
$ENV{%s}</dt>
<dd>
<p>You called <code>run</code> or <code>capture</code> but part of your
environment was tainted (untrusted). You should either delete the named
environment variable before calling <code>run</code>, or set it to an
untainted value (usually one set inside your program). See Cleaning Up
Your Path in perlsec for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Error in IPC::System::Simple plumbing: "%s" - "%s"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Implementing the <code>capture</code> command involves dark and
terrible magicks involving pipes, and one of them has sprung a leak.
This could be due to a lack of file descriptors, although there are
other possibilities. If you are able to reproduce this error, you are
encouraged to submit a bug report according to the Reporting bugs
section below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Internal error in IPC::System::Simple: "%s"</dt>
<dd>
<p>You've found a bug in <code>IPC::System::Simple</code>. Please check
to see if an updated version of <code>IPC::System::Simple</code> is
available. If not, please file a bug report according to the Reporting
bugs section below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IPC::System::Simple::%s called with undefined command</dt>
<dd>
<p>You've passed the undefined value as a command to be executed. While
this is a very Zen-like action, it's not supported by Perl's current
implementation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DEPENDENCIES</h1>
<p>This module depends upon Win32::Process when used on Win32 system.
<code>Win32::Process</code> is bundled as a core module in ActivePerl
5.6 and above.</p>
<p>There are no non-core dependencies on non-Win32 systems.</p>
<h1>COMPARISON TO OTHER APIs</h1>
<p>Perl provides a range of in-built functions for handling external
commands, and CPAN provides even more. The
<code>IPC::System::Simple</code> differentiates itself from other
options by providing:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Extremely detailed diagnostics</dt>
<dd>
<p>The diagnostics produced by <code>IPC::System::Simple</code> are
designed to provide as much information as possible. Rather than
requiring the developer to inspect <code>$?</code>,
<code>IPC::System::Simple</code> does the hard work for you. If an odd
exit status is provided, you're informed of what it is. If a signal
kills your process, you are informed of both its name and number. If
tainted data or environment prevents your command from running, you are
informed of exactly which data or environmental variable is tainted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exceptions on failure</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>IPC::System::Simple</code> takes an aggressive approach to
error handling. Rather than allow commands to fail silently, exceptions
are thrown when unexpected results are seen. This allows for easy
development using a try/catch style, and avoids the possibility of
accidentally continuing after a failed command.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Easy access to exit status</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>run</code>, <code>system</code> and <code>capture</code>
commands all set <code>$EXITVAL</code>, making it easy to determine the
exit status of a command. Additionally, the <code>system</code> and
<code>run</code> interfaces return the exit status.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Consistent interfaces</dt>
<dd>
<p>When called with multiple arguments, the <code>run</code>,
<code>system</code> and <code>capture</code> interfaces <em>never</em>
invoke the shell. This differs from the in-built Perl
<code>system</code> command which may invoke the shell under Windows
when called with multiple arguments. It differs from the in-built Perl
backticks operator which always invokes the shell.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>When <code>system</code> is exported, the exotic form
<code>system { $cmd } @args</code> is not supported. Attemping to use
the exotic form is a syntax error. This affects the calling package
<em>only</em>. Use <code>CORE::system</code> if you need it, or consider
using the autodie module to replace <code>system</code> with lexical
scope.</p>
<p>Core dumps are only checked for when a process dies due to a signal.
It is not believed there are any systems where processes can dump core
without dying to a signal.</p>
<p><code>WIFSTOPPED</code> status is not checked, as perl never spawns
processes with the <code>WUNTRACED</code> option.</p>
<p>Signals are not supported under Win32 systems, since they don't work
at all like Unix signals. Win32 signals cause commands to exit with a
given exit value, which this modules <em>does</em> capture.</p>
