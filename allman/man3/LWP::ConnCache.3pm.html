<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>LWP::ConnCache - Connection cache manager</p>
<h1>NOTE</h1>
<p>This module is experimental. Details of its interface is likely to
change in the future.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use LWP::ConnCache; my $cache = LWP::ConnCache-&gt;new;
$cache-&gt;deposit($type, $key, $sock); $sock =
$cache-&gt;withdraw($type, $key);</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <code>LWP::ConnCache</code> class is the standard connection
cache manager for LWP::UserAgent.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>The following basic methods are provided:</p>
<h2>new</h2>
<p>my $cache = LWP::ConnCache-&gt;new( %options )</p>
<p>This method constructs a new LWP::ConnCache object. The only option
currently accepted is <code>total_capacity</code>. If specified it
initializes the total_capacity in LWP::ConnCache option. It defaults to
<code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>total_capacity</h2>
<p>my $cap = $cache-&gt;total_capacity; $cache-&gt;total_capacity(0); #
drop all immediately $cache-&gt;total_capacity(undef); # no limit
$cache-&gt;total_capacity($number);</p>
<p>Get/sets the number of connection that will be cached. Connections
will start to be dropped when this limit is reached. If set to
<code>0</code>, then all connections are immediately dropped. If set to
<code>undef</code>, then there is no limit.</p>
<h2>capacity</h2>
<p>my $http_capacity = $cache-&gt;capacity(http);
$cache-&gt;capacity(http, 2 );</p>
<p>Get/set a limit for the number of connections of the specified type
that can be cached. The first parameter is a short string like
<code>"http"</code> or <code>"ftp"</code>.</p>
<h2>drop</h2>
<p>$cache-&gt;drop(); # Drop ALL connections # which is just a synonym
for: $cache-&gt;drop(sub{1}); # Drop ALL connections # drop all
connections older than 22 seconds and add a reason for it!
$cache-&gt;drop(22, "Older than 22 secs dropped"); # which is just a
synonym for: $cache-&gt;drop(sub { my ($conn, $type, $key,
$deposit_time) = @_; if ($deposit_time &lt; 22) { # true values drop the
connection return 1; } # false values dont drop the connection return 0;
}, "Older than 22 secs dropped" );</p>
<p>Drop connections by some criteria. The <code>$checker</code> argument
is a subroutine that is called for each connection. If the routine
returns a TRUE value then the connection is dropped. The routine is
called with <code>($conn, $type, $key, $deposit_time)</code> as
arguments.</p>
<p>Shortcuts: If the <code>$checker</code> argument is absent (or
<code>undef</code>) all cached connections are dropped. If the
<code>$checker</code> is a number then all connections untouched that
the given number of seconds or more are dropped. If
<code>$checker</code> is a string then all connections of the given type
are dropped.</p>
<p>The <code>reason</code> is passed on to the dropped in LWP::ConnCache
method.</p>
<h2>prune</h2>
<p>$cache-&gt;prune();</p>
<p>Calling this method will drop all connections that are dead. This is
tested by calling the ping in LWP::ConnCache method on the connections.
If the ping in LWP::ConnCache method exists and returns a false value,
then the connection is dropped.</p>
<h2>get_types</h2>
<p>my @types = $cache-&gt;get_types();</p>
<p>This returns all the <code>type</code> fields used for the currently
cached connections.</p>
<h2>get_connections</h2>
<p>my @conns = $cache-&gt;get_connections(); # all connections my @conns
= $cache-&gt;get_connections(http); # connections for http</p>
<p>This returns all connection objects of the specified type. If no type
is specified then all connections are returned. In scalar context the
number of cached connections of the specified type is returned.</p>
<h1>PROTOCOL METHODS</h1>
<p>The following methods are called by low-level protocol modules to try
to save away connections and to get them back.</p>
<h2>deposit</h2>
<p>$cache-&gt;deposit($type, $key, $conn);</p>
<p>This method adds a new connection to the cache. As a result, other
already cached connections might be dropped. Multiple connections with
the same type/key might be added.</p>
<h2>withdraw</h2>
<p>my $conn = $cache-&gt;withdraw($type, $key);</p>
<p>This method tries to fetch back a connection that was previously
deposited. If no cached connection with the specified
<code>$type</code>/$key is found, then <code>undef</code> is returned.
There is not guarantee that a deposited connection can be withdrawn, as
the cache manger is free to drop connections at any time.</p>
<h1>INTERNAL METHODS</h1>
<p>The following methods are called internally. Subclasses might want to
override them.</p>
<h2>enforce_limits</h2>
<p>$conn-&gt;enforce_limits([$type])</p>
<p>This method is called with after a new connection is added
(deposited) in the cache or capacity limits are adjusted. The default
implementation drops connections until the specified capacity limits are
not exceeded.</p>
<h2>dropping</h2>
<p>$conn-&gt;dropping($conn_record, $reason)</p>
<p>This method is called when a connection is dropped. The record
belonging to the dropped connection is passed as the first argument and
a string describing the reason for the drop is passed as the second
argument. The default implementation makes some noise if the
<code>$LWP::ConnCache::DEBUG</code> variable is set and nothing
more.</p>
<h1>SUBCLASSING</h1>
<p>For specialized cache policy it makes sense to subclass
<code>LWP::ConnCache</code> and perhaps override the deposit in
LWP::ConnCache, enforce_limits in LWP::ConnCache, and dropping in
LWP::ConnCache methods.</p>
<p>The object itself is a hash. Keys prefixed with <code>cc_</code> are
reserved for the base class.</p>
