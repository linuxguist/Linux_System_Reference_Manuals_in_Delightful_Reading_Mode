</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a perl/Tk callback to associate with the button. This
command is typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the
button window. The button's global variable (<strong>-variable</strong>
option) will be updated before the command is invoked.</p>
<dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Height</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -height</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a desired height for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units (i.e.
any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for text
it is in lines of text. If this option isn't specified, the button's
desired height is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text
being displayed in it.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: IndicatorOn</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -indicatoron</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies whether or not the indicator should be drawn. Must be a
proper boolean value. If false, the <strong>relief</strong> option is
ignored and the widget's relief is always sunken if the widget is
selected and raised otherwise.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Command-Line Name: -offrelief</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Database Name: offRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Database Class: OffRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies the relief for the checkbutton when the indicator is not
drawn and the checkbutton is off. The default value is
<strong>raised</strong>. By setting this option to <strong>flat</strong>
and setting <strong>-indicatoron false -overrelief raised</strong>, the
effect is achieved of having a flat button that raises on mouse-over and
which is depressed when activated. This is the behavior typically
exhibited by the Bold, Italic, and Underline checkbuttons on the toolbar
of a word-processor, for example.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Value</dt>
<dd>

</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Database Name: overRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Database Class: OverRelief</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies an alternative relief for the button, to be used when the
mouse cursor is over the widget. This option can be used to make toolbar
buttons, by configuring <strong>-relief flat -overrelief</strong>
raised. If the value of this option is the empty string, then no
alternative relief is used when the mouse cursor is over the button. The
empty string is the default value.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: selectColor</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Background</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -selectcolor</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a background color to use when the button is selected. If
<strong>indicatorOn</strong> is true then the color applies to the
indicator. Under Windows, this color is used as the background for the
indicator regardless of the select state. If
<strong>indicatorOn</strong> is false, this color is used as the
background for the entire widget, in place of
<strong>background</strong> or <strong>activeBackground</strong>,
whenever the widget is selected. If specified as an empty string then no
special color is used for displaying when the widget is selected.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: selectImage</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: SelectImage</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -selectimage</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies an image to display (in place of the <strong>image</strong>
option) when the checkbutton is selected. This option is ignored unless
the <strong>image</strong> option has been specified.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: state</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: State</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -state</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the checkbutton:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>, or
<strong>disabled</strong>. In normal state the checkbutton is displayed
using the <strong>foreground</strong> and <strong>background</strong>
options. The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the
checkbutton. In active state the checkbutton is displayed using the
<strong>activeForeground</strong> and <strong>activeBackground</strong>
options. Disabled state means that the checkbutton should be
insensitive: the default bindings will refuse to activate the widget and
will ignore mouse button presses. In this state the
<strong>disabledForeground</strong> and <strong>background</strong>
options determine how the checkbutton is displayed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: variable</dt>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Variable</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -variable</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies reference to a variable to set to indicate whether or not
this button is selected. Defaults to <code>\$widget-&gt;{Value}</code>
member of the widget's hash. In general perl variables are
<code>undef</code> unless specifically initialized which will not match
either default <strong>-onvalue</strong> or default
<strong>-offvalue</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name: width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Class: Width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Switch: -width</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units (i.e.
any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for text
it is in characters. If this option isn't specified, the button's
desired width is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text
being displayed in it.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Checkbutton</strong> method creates a new window (given
by the <code>$widget</code> argument) and makes it into a checkbutton
widget. Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the
checkbutton such as its colors, font, text, and initial relief. The
<strong>checkbutton</strong> command returns its <code>$widget</code>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <code>$widget</code>, but <code>$widget</code>'s parent
must exist.</p>
<p>A checkbutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or
image and a square called an <em>indicator</em>. If text is displayed,
it must all be in a single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the
screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of the
<strong>wrapLength</strong> option) and one of the characters may
optionally be underlined using the <strong>underline</strong> option. A
checkbutton has all of the behavior of a simple button, including the
following: it can display itself in either of three different ways,
according to the <strong>state</strong> option; it can be made to appear
raised, sunken, or flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes a
perl/Tk callback whenever mouse button 1 is clicked over the
checkbutton.</p>
<p>In addition, checkbuttons can be <em>selected</em>. If a checkbutton
is selected then the indicator is normally drawn with a selected
appearance, and a Tcl variable associated with the checkbutton is set to
a particular value (normally 1). Under Unix, the indicator is drawn with
a sunken relief and a special color. Under Windows, the indicator is
drawn with a check mark inside. If the checkbutton is not selected, then
the indicator is drawn with a deselected appearance, and the associated
variable is set to a different value (typically 0). Under Unix, the
indicator is drawn with a raised relief and no special color. Under
Windows, the indicator is drawn without a check mark inside. By default,
the name of the variable associated with a checkbutton is the same as
the <em>name</em> used to create the checkbutton. The variable name, and
the ``on'' and ``off'' values stored in it, may be modified with options
on the command line or in the option database. Configuration options may
also be used to modify the way the indicator is displayed (or whether it
is displayed at all). By default a checkbutton is configured to select
and deselect itself on alternate button clicks. In addition, each
checkbutton monitors its associated variable and automatically selects
and deselects itself when the variables value changes to and from the
button's ``on'' value.</p>
<h1>WIDGET METHODS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Checkbutton</strong> method creates a widget object. This
object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong>
methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify
the options described above. The widget also inherits all the methods
provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for checkbutton
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$checkbutton-&gt;deselect</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deselects the checkbutton and sets the associated variable to its
``off'' value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$checkbutton-&gt;flash</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flashes the checkbutton. This is accomplished by redisplaying the
checkbutton several times, alternating between active and normal colors.
At the end of the flash the checkbutton is left in the same
normal/active state as when the command was invoked. This command is
ignored if the checkbutton's state is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$checkbutton-&gt;invoke</dt>
<dd>
<p>Does just what would have happened if the user invoked the
checkbutton with the mouse: toggle the selection state of the button and
invoke the perl/Tk callback associated with the checkbutton, if there is
one. The return value is the return value from the perl/Tk callback, or
an empty string if there is no command associated with the checkbutton.
This command is ignored if the checkbutton's state is
<strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$checkbutton-&gt;select</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects the checkbutton and sets the associated variable to its
``on'' value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>$checkbutton-&gt;toggle</dt>
<dd>
<p>Toggles the selection state of the button, redisplaying it and
modifying its associated variable to reflect the new state.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for checkbuttons that give
them the following default behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>On Unix systems, a checkbutton activates whenever the mouse passes
over it and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the checkbutton. On
Mac and Windows systems, when mouse button 1 is pressed over a
checkbutton, the button activates whenever the mouse pointer is inside
the button, and deactivates whenever the mouse pointer leaves the
button.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When mouse button 1 is pressed over a checkbutton, it is invoked (its
selection state toggles and the command associated with the button is
invoked, if there is one).</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When a checkbutton has the input focus, the space key causes the
checkbutton to be invoked. Under Windows, there are additional key
bindings; plus (+) and equal (=) select the button, and minus (-)
deselects the button. If the checkbutton's state is
<strong>disabled</strong> then none of the above actions occur: the
checkbutton is completely non-responsive. The behavior of checkbuttons
can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by
redefining the class bindings.</p>
