<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>HTML::TreeBuilder - Parser that builds a HTML syntax tree</p>
<h1>VERSION</h1>
<p>This document describes version 5.07 of HTML::TreeBuilder, released
August 31, 2017 as part of HTML-Tree.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use HTML::TreeBuilder 5 -weak; # Ensure weak references in use
foreach my $file_name (@ARGV) { my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new; #
empty tree $tree-&gt;parse_file($file_name); print "Hey, heres a dump of
the parse tree of $file_name:\n"; $tree-&gt;dump; # a method we inherit
from HTML::Element print "And here it is, bizarrely rerendered as
HTML:\n", $tree-&gt;as_HTML, "\n"; # Now that were done with it, we must
destroy it. # $tree = $tree-&gt;delete; # Not required with weak
references }</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>(This class is part of the HTML::Tree dist.)</p>
<p>This class is for HTML syntax trees that get built out of HTML
source. The way to use it is to:</p>
<p>1. start a new (empty) HTML::TreeBuilder object,</p>
<p>2. then use one of the methods from HTML::Parser (presumably with
<code>$tree-&gt;parse_file($filename)</code> for files, or with
<code>$tree-&gt;parse($document_content)</code> and
<code>$tree-&gt;eof</code> if you've got the content in a string) to
parse the HTML document into the tree <code>$tree</code>.</p>
<p>(You can combine steps 1 and 2 with the new_from_file or
new_from_content methods.)</p>
<p>2b. call <code>$root-&gt;elementify()</code> if you want.</p>
<p>3. do whatever you need to do with the syntax tree, presumably
involving traversing it looking for some bit of information in it,</p>
<p>4. previous versions of HTML::TreeBuilder required you to call
<code>$tree-&gt;delete()</code> to erase the contents of the tree from
memory when you're done with the tree. This is not normally required
anymore. See Weak References in HTML::Element for details.</p>
<h1>ATTRIBUTES</h1>
<p>Most of the following attributes native to HTML::TreeBuilder control
how parsing takes place; they should be set <em>before</em> you try
parsing into the given object. You can set the attributes by passing a
TRUE or FALSE value as argument. E.g.,
<code>$root-&gt;implicit_tags</code> returns the current setting for the
<code>implicit_tags</code> option,
<code>$root-&gt;implicit_tags(1)</code> turns that option on, and
<code>$root-&gt;implicit_tags(0)</code> turns it off.</p>
<h2>implicit_tags</h2>
<p>Setting this attribute to true will instruct the parser to try to
deduce implicit elements and implicit end tags. If it is false you get a
parse tree that just reflects the text as it stands, which is unlikely
to be useful for anything but quick and dirty parsing. (In fact, I'd be
curious to hear from anyone who finds it useful to have
<code>implicit_tags</code> set to false.) Default is true.</p>
<p>Implicit elements have the implicit in HTML::Element attribute
set.</p>
<h2>implicit_body_p_tag</h2>
<p>This controls an aspect of implicit element behavior, if
<code>implicit_tags</code> is on: If a text element (PCDATA) or a
phrasal element (such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>) is to be inserted
under <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, two things can happen: if
<code>implicit_body_p_tag</code> is true, it's placed under a new,
implicit <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. (Past DTDs suggested this was the
only correct behavior, and this is how past versions of this module
behaved.) But if <code>implicit_body_p_tag</code> is false, nothing is
implicated Ω- the PCDATA or phrasal element is simply placed under
<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Default is false.</p>
<h2>no_expand_entities</h2>
<p>This attribute controls whether entities are decoded during the
initial parse of the source. Enable this if you don't want entities
decoded to their character value. e.g. '&amp;amp;' is decoded to '&amp;'
by default, but will be unchanged if this is enabled. Default is false
(entities will be decoded.)</p>
<h2>ignore_unknown</h2>
<p>This attribute controls whether unknown tags should be represented as
elements in the parse tree, or whether they should be ignored. Default
is true (to ignore unknown tags.)</p>
<h2>ignore_text</h2>
<p>Do not represent the text content of elements. This saves space if
all you want is to examine the structure of the document. Default is
false.</p>
<h2>ignore_ignorable_whitespace</h2>
<p>If set to true, TreeBuilder will try to avoid creating ignorable
whitespace text nodes in the tree. Default is true. (In fact, I'd be
interested in hearing if there's ever a case where you need this off, or
where leaving it on leads to incorrect behavior.)</p>
<h2>no_space_compacting</h2>
<p>This determines whether TreeBuilder compacts all whitespace strings
in the document (well, outside of PRE or TEXTAREA elements), or leaves
them alone. Normally (default, value of 0), each string of contiguous
whitespace in the document is turned into a single space. But that's not
done if <code>no_space_compacting</code> is set to 1.</p>
<p>Setting <code>no_space_compacting</code> to 1 might be useful if you
want to read in a tree just to make some minor changes to it before
writing it back out.</p>
<p>This method is experimental. If you use it, be sure to report any
problems you might have with it.</p>
<h2>p_strict</h2>
<p>If set to true (and it defaults to false), TreeBuilder will take a
narrower than normal view of what can be under a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
element; if it sees a non-phrasal element about to be inserted under a
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, it will close that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
Otherwise it will close <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements only for other
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>'s, headings, and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>
(although the latter may be removed in future versions).</p>
<p>For example, when going thru this snippet of code,</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;stuff &lt;ul&gt;</p>
<p>TreeBuilder will normally (with <code>p_strict</code> false) put the
<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element under the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
element. However, with <code>p_strict</code> set to true, it will close
the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> first.</p>
<p>In theory, there should be strictness options like this for other/all
elements besides just <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>; but I treat this as a
special case simply because of the fact that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
occurs so frequently and its end-tag is omitted so often; and also
because application of strictness rules at parse-time across all
elements often makes tiny errors in HTML coding produce drastically bad
parse-trees, in my experience.</p>
<p>If you find that you wish you had an option like this to enforce
content-models on all elements, then I suggest that what you want is
content-model checking as a stage after TreeBuilder has finished
parsing.</p>
<h2>store_comments</h2>
<p>This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store comments
found while parsing content into <code>$root</code>. Currently, this is
off by default.</p>
<h2>store_declarations</h2>
<p>This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store markup
declarations found while parsing content into <code>$root</code>. This
is on by default.</p>
<h2>store_pis</h2>
<p>This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store processing
instructions found while parsing content into <code>$root</code> Ω-
assuming a recent version of HTML::Parser (old versions won't parse PIs
correctly). Currently, this is off (false) by default.</p>
<p>It is somewhat of a known bug (to be fixed one of these days, if
anyone needs it?) that PIs in the preamble (before the
<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> start-tag) end up actually <em>under</em> the
<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p>
<h2>warn</h2>
<p>This determines whether syntax errors during parsing should generate
warnings, emitted via Perl's <code>warn</code> function.</p>
<p>This is off (false) by default.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p>Objects of this class inherit the methods of both HTML::Parser and
HTML::Element. The methods inherited from HTML::Parser are used for
building the HTML tree, and the methods inherited from HTML::Element are
what you use to scrutinize the tree. Besides this (HTML::TreeBuilder)
documentation, you must also carefully read the HTML::Element
documentation, and also skim the HTML::Parser documentation Ω- probably
only its parse and parse_file methods are of interest.</p>
<h2>new_from_file</h2>
<p>$root =
HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_file($filename_or_filehandle);</p>
<p>This shortcut constructor merely combines constructing a new object
(with the new method, below), and calling
<code>$new-&gt;parse_file(...)</code> on it. Returns the new object.
Note that this provides no way of setting any parse options like
<code>store_comments</code> (for that, call <code>new</code>, and then
set options, before calling <code>parse_file</code>). See the notes
(below) on parameters to parse_file.</p>
<p>If HTML::TreeBuilder is unable to read the file, then
<code>new_from_file</code> dies. The error can also be found in
<code>$!</code>. (This behavior is new in HTML-Tree 5. Previous versions
returned a tree with only implicit elements.)</p>
<h2>new_from_content</h2>
<p>$root = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_content(...);</p>
<p>This shortcut constructor merely combines constructing a new object
(with the new method, below), and calling
<code>for(...){$new-&gt;parse($_)}</code> and <code>$new-&gt;eof</code>
on it. Returns the new object. Note that this provides no way of setting
any parse options like <code>store_comments</code> (for that, call
<code>new</code>, and then set options, before calling
<code>parse</code>). Example usages:
<code>HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_content(@lines)</code>, or
<code>HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_content($content)</code>.</p>
<h2>new_from_url</h2>
<p>$root = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_url($url)</p>
<p>This shortcut constructor combines constructing a new object (with
the new method, below), loading LWP::UserAgent, fetching the specified
URL, and calling
<code>$new-&gt;parse( $response-&gt;decoded_content)</code> and
<code>$new-&gt;eof</code> on it. Returns the new object. Note that this
provides no way of setting any parse options like
<code>store_comments</code>.</p>
<p>If LWP is unable to fetch the URL, or the response is not HTML (as
determined by content_is_html in HTTP::Headers), then
<code>new_from_url</code> dies, and the HTTP::Response object is found
in <code>$HTML::TreeBuilder::lwp_response</code>.</p>
<p>You must have installed LWP::UserAgent for this method to work. LWP
is not installed automatically, because it's a large set of modules and
you might not need it.</p>
<h2>new</h2>
<p>$root = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new();</p>
<p>This creates a new HTML::TreeBuilder object. This method takes no
attributes.</p>
<h2>parse_file</h2>
<p>$root-&gt;parse_file(...)</p>
<p>[An important method inherited from HTML::Parser, which see. Current
versions of HTML::Parser can take a filespec, or a filehandle object,
like *FOO, or some object from class IO::Handle, IO::File, IO::Socket)
or the like. I think you should check that a given file exists
<em>before</em> calling
<code>$root-&gt;parse_file($filespec)</code>.]</p>
<p>When you pass a filename to <code>parse_file</code>, HTML::Parser
opens it in binary mode, which means it's interpreted as Latin-1
(ISO-8859-1). If the file is in another encoding, like UTF-8 or UTF-16,
this will not do the right thing.</p>
<p>One solution is to open the file yourself using the proper
<code>:encoding</code> layer, and pass the filehandle to
<code>parse_file</code>. You can automate this process by using
html_file in IO::HTML, which will use the HTML5 encoding sniffing
algorithm to automatically determine the proper <code>:encoding</code>
layer and apply it.</p>
<p>In the next major release of HTML-Tree, I plan to have it use
IO::HTML automatically. If you really want your file opened in binary
mode, you should open it yourself and pass the filehandle to
<code>parse_file</code>.</p>
<p>The return value is <code>undef</code> if there's an error opening
the file. In that case, the error will be in <code>$!</code>.</p>
<h2>parse</h2>
<p>$root-&gt;parse(...)</p>
<p>[A important method inherited from HTML::Parser, which see. See the
note below for <code>$root-&gt;eof()</code>.]</p>
<h2>eof</h2>
<p>$root-&gt;eof();</p>
<p>This signals that you're finished parsing content into this tree;
this runs various kinds of crucial cleanup on the tree. This is called
<em>for you</em> when you call <code>$root-&gt;parse_file(...)</code>,
but not when you call <code>$root-&gt;parse(...)</code>. So if you call
<code>$root-&gt;parse(...)</code>, then you <em>must</em> call
<code>$root-&gt;eof()</code> once you've finished feeding all the chunks
to <code>parse(...)</code>, and before you actually start doing anything
else with the tree in <code>$root</code>.</p>
<h2>parse_content</h2>
<p>$root-&gt;parse_content(...);</p>
<p>Basically a handy alias for
<code>$root-&gt;parse(...); $root-&gt;eof</code>. Takes the exact same
arguments as <code>$root-&gt;parse()</code>.</p>
<h2>delete</h2>
<p>$root-&gt;delete();</p>
<p>[A previously important method inherited from HTML::Element, which
see.]</p>
<h2>elementify</h2>
<p>$root-&gt;elementify();</p>
<p>This changes the class of the object in <code>$root</code> from
HTML::TreeBuilder to the class used for all the rest of the elements in
that tree (generally HTML::Element). Returns <code>$root</code>.</p>
<p>For most purposes, this is unnecessary, but if you call this after
(after!!) you've finished building a tree, then it keeps you from
accidentally trying to call anything but HTML::Element methods on it.
(I.e., if you accidentally call <code>$root-&gt;parse_file(...)</code>
on the already-complete and elementified tree, then instead of charging
ahead and <em>wreaking havoc</em>, it'll throw a fatal error Ω- since
<code>$root</code> is now an object just of class HTML::Element which
has no <code>parse_file</code> method.</p>
<p>Note that <code>elementify</code> currently deletes all the private
attributes of <code>$root</code> except for _tag, _parent, _content,
_pos, and _implicit. If anyone requests that I change this to leave in
yet more private attributes, I might do so, in future versions.</p>
<h2>guts</h2>
<p>@nodes = $root-&gt;guts(); $parent_for_nodes = $root-&gt;guts();</p>
<p>In list context (as in the first case), this method returns the
topmost non-implicit nodes in a tree. This is useful when you're parsing
HTML code that you know doesn't expect an HTML document, but instead
just a fragment of an HTML document. For example, if you wanted the
parse tree for a file consisting of just this:</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;I like pie!</p>
<p>Then you would get that with <code>@nodes = $root-&gt;guts();</code>.
It so happens that in this case, <code>@nodes</code> will contain just
one element object, representing the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> node (with
I like pie! being its text child node). However, consider if you were
parsing this:</p>
<p>&lt;hr&gt;Hooboy!&lt;hr&gt;</p>
<p>In that case, <code>$root-&gt;guts()</code> would return three items:
an element object for the first <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, a text string
Hooboy!, and another <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element object.</p>
<p>For cases where you want definitely one element (so you can treat it
as a document fragment, roughly speaking), call <code>guts()</code> in
scalar context, as in <code>$parent_for_nodes = $root-&gt;guts()</code>.
That works like <code>guts()</code> in list context; in fact,
<code>guts()</code> in list context would have returned exactly one
value, and if it would have been an object (as opposed to a text
string), then that's what <code>guts</code> in scalar context will
return. Otherwise, if <code>guts()</code> in list context would have
returned no values at all, then <code>guts()</code> in scalar context
returns undef. In all other cases, <code>guts()</code> in scalar context
returns an implicit <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element node, with children
consisting of whatever nodes <code>guts()</code> in list context would
have returned. Note that that may detach those nodes from
<code>$root</code>'s tree.</p>
<h2>disembowel</h2>
<p>@nodes = $root-&gt;disembowel(); $parent_for_nodes =
$root-&gt;disembowel();</p>
<p>The <code>disembowel()</code> method works just like the
<code>guts()</code> method, except that disembowel definitively destroys
the tree above the nodes that are returned. Usually when you want the
guts from a tree, you're just going to toss out the rest of the tree
anyway, so this saves you the bother. (Remember, disembowel means remove
the guts from.)</p>
<h1>INTERNAL METHODS</h1>
<p>You should not need to call any of the following methods
directly.</p>
<h2>element_class</h2>
<p>$classname = $h-&gt;element_class;</p>
<p>This method returns the class which will be used for new elements. It
defaults to HTML::Element, but can be overridden by subclassing or
esoteric means best left to those will will read the source and then not
complain when those esoteric means change. (Just subclass.)</p>
<h2>comment</h2>
<p>Accept a here's a comment signal from HTML::Parser.</p>
<h2>declaration</h2>
<p>Accept a here's a markup declaration signal from HTML::Parser.</p>
<h2>done</h2>
<p>TODO: document</p>

closing currently open elements in some fairly complex way, as used by
other methods in this class.</p>

<h2>warning</h2>
<p>Wrapper for CORE::warn</p>
<p>TODO: why not just use carp?</p>
<h1>SUBROUTINES</h1>
<h2>DEBUG</h2>
<p>Are we in Debug mode? This is a constant subroutine, to allow
compile-time optimizations. To control debug mode, set
<code>$HTML::TreeBuilder::DEBUG</code> <em>before</em> loading
HTML::TreeBuilder.</p>
<h1>HTML AND ITS DISCONTENTS</h1>
<p>HTML is rather harder to parse than people who write it generally
suspect.</p>
<p>Here's the problem: HTML is a kind of SGML that permits minimization
and implication. In short, this means that you don't have to close every
tag you open (because the opening of a subsequent tag may implicitly
close it), and if you use a tag that can't occur in the context you seem
to using it in, under certain conditions the parser will be able to
realize you mean to leave the current context and enter the new one,
that being the only one that your code could correctly be interpreted
in.</p>
<p>Now, this would all work flawlessly and unproblematically if: 1) all
the rules that both prescribe and describe HTML were (and had been)
clearly set out, and 2) everyone was aware of these rules and wrote
their code in compliance to them.</p>
<p>However, it didn't happen that way, and so most HTML pages are
difficult if not impossible to correctly parse with nearly any set of
straightforward SGML rules. That's why the internals of
HTML::TreeBuilder consist of lots and lots of special cases Ω- instead
of being just a generic SGML parser with HTML DTD rules plugged in.</p>
<h1>TRANSLATIONS?</h1>
<p>The techniques that HTML::TreeBuilder uses to perform what I consider
very robust parses on everyday code are not things that can work only in
Perl. To date, the algorithms at the center of HTML::TreeBuilder have
been implemented only in Perl, as far as I know; and I don't foresee
getting around to implementing them in any other language any time
soon.</p>
<p>If, however, anyone is looking for a semester project for an applied
programming class (or if they merely enjoy <em>extra-curricular</em>
masochism), they might do well to see about choosing as a topic the
implementation/adaptation of these routines to any other interesting
programming language that you feel currently suffers from a lack of
robust HTML-parsing. I welcome correspondence on this subject, and point
out that one can learn a great deal about languages by trying to
translate between them, and then comparing the result.</p>
<p>The HTML::TreeBuilder source may seem long and complex, but it is
rather well commented, and symbol names are generally self-explanatory.
(You are encouraged to read the Mozilla HTML parser source for
comparison.) Some of the complexity comes from little-used features, and
some of it comes from having the HTML tokenizer (HTML::Parser) being a
separate module, requiring somewhat of a different interface than you'd
find in a combined tokenizer and tree-builder. But most of the length of
the source comes from the fact that it's essentially a long list of
special cases, with lots and lots of sanity-checking, and
sanity-recovery Ω- because, as Roseanne Rosannadanna once said, "it's
always <em>something</em>".</p>
<p>Users looking to compare several HTML parsers should look at the
source for Raggett's Tidy
(<code>&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/&gt;</code>), Mozilla
(<code>&lt;http://www.mozilla.org/&gt;</code>), and possibly root around
the browsers section of Yahoo to find the various open-source ones
(<code>&lt;http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Browsers/&gt;</code>).</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>* Framesets seem to work correctly now. Email me if you get a strange
parse from a document with framesets.</p>
<p>* Really bad HTML code will, often as not, make for a somewhat
objectionable parse tree. Regrettable, but unavoidably true.</p>
<p>* If you're running with <code>implicit_tags</code> off (God help
you!), consider that <code>$tree-&gt;content_list</code> probably
contains the tree or grove from the parse, and not <code>$tree</code>
itself (which will, oddly enough, be an implicit
<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element). This seems counter-intuitive and
problematic; but seeing as how almost no HTML ever parses correctly with
<code>implicit_tags</code> off, this interface oddity seems the least of
your problems.</p>
<h1>BUG REPORTS</h1>
<p>When a document parses in a way different from how you think it
should, I ask that you report this to me as a bug. The first thing you
should do is copy the document, trim out as much of it as you can while
still producing the bug in question, and <em>then</em> email me that
mini-document <em>and</em> the code you're using to parse it, to the
HTML::Tree bug queue at
<code>&lt;bug-html-tree at rt.cpan.org&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Include a note as to how it parses (presumably including its
<code>$tree-&gt;dump</code> output), and then a <em>careful and
clear</em> explanation of where you think the parser is going astray,
and how you would prefer that it work instead.</p>
