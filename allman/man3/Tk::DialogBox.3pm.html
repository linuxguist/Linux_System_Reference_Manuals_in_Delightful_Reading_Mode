<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Tk::DialogBox - create and manipulate a dialog screen.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Tk::DialogBox ... $d = $top-&gt;DialogBox(-title =&gt; "Title",
-buttons =&gt; ["OK", "Cancel"]); $w = $d-&gt;add(Widget,
args)-&gt;pack; ... $button = $d-&gt;Show;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>DialogBox</strong> is very similar to <strong>Dialog</strong>
except that it allows any widget in the top Frame.
<strong>DialogBox</strong> creates two Frames, <em>top</em> and
<em>bottom</em>. The bottom Frame shows all the specified Buttons, lined
up from left to right. The top Frame acts as a container for all other
widgets that can be added with the <strong>add()</strong> method.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The options recognized by <strong>DialogBox</strong> are as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-title</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the title of the DialogBox. If this is not set, then the name
of the program is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-buttons</dt>
<dd>
<p>The button names to display in the bottom Frame. This is a reference
to an array of strings containing the text to put on each Button. There
is no default value for this. If you do not specify any button names, no
Buttons are displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-default_button</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the default Button that is considered invoked when user
presses &lt;Return&gt; on the DialogBox. This Button is highlighted. If
no default Button is specified, then the first element of the array
whose reference is passed to the <strong>-buttons</strong> option is
used as the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-cancel_button</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the Button that is considered invoked when the user closes
the DialogBox using the window manager's close button. If the
<strong>-cancel_button</strong> option is not given, and if there's only
one button configured, then this button is also used as the cancel
button. Otherwise no button is considered as the cancel button; in such
a case <strong>Show</strong> just returns <code>undef</code> when the
user closes the DialogBox.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-command</dt>
<dd>
<p>A callback which is executed after invoking an action to close the
DialogBox, but before restoring focus and grab information. The selected
button is passed as the first argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-focus</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the widget to receive the initial focus after popping up the
DialogBox. By default the <strong>-default_button</strong> widget
receives the initial focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-showcommand</dt>
<dd>
<p>A callback which is executed before displaying the DialogBox and
waiting for user input. The DialogBox itself is passed as the first
argument.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<p><strong>DialogBox</strong> supports only two methods as of now:</p>
<dl>
<dt>add(widget, options)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add the widget indicated by <em>widget</em>. <em>Widget</em> can be
the name of any Tk widget (standard or contributed). <em>options</em>
are the options that the widget accepts. The widget is advertized as a
subwidget of <strong>DialogBox</strong>. The name of <em>widget</em> is
lower-cased and used as the advertised name. If multiple instances of
<em>widget</em> are created in the <strong>DialogBox</strong>, then only
the last one gets the advertised name. <strong>add()</strong> does not
automatically <strong>pack()</strong> or <strong>grid()</strong>
<em>widget</em> into the <strong>DialogBox</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Show(?-global?)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Displays the Dialog until the user invokes one of the Buttons in the
bottom Frame. If the grab type <em>-global</em> is specified, then
<strong>Show</strong> uses that grab; otherwise it defaults to a local
grab. Returns the name of the Button invoked. The actual Dialog is shown
using the <strong>Popup</strong> method. Any other options supplied to
<strong>Show</strong> are passed to <strong>Popup</strong>, and can be
used to position the Dialog on the screen. Please read Tk::Popup for
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exit()</dt>
<dd>
<p>Close the dialogbox, by emulating a click on the default button.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ADVERTISED WIDGETS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>top</dt>
<dd>
<p>The subwidget reference to the top half of the DialogBox widget, the
Frame containing widgets added by the <strong>add</strong> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bottom</dt>
<dd>
<p>The subwidget reference to the bottom half of the DialogBox widget,
the Frame containing the Button widgets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>B_"button-text"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Individual subwidget references to the Buttons in the DialogBox
widget. The subwidget name is the string <em>B_</em> concatenated with
the Button's -text value.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>There is no way of removing a widget once it has been added to the
top Frame, unless you access the <em>top</em> subwidget and go through
the child widgets.</p>
<p>There is no control over the appearance of the Buttons in the bottom
Frame nor is there any way to control the placement of the two Frames
with respect to each other.</p>
