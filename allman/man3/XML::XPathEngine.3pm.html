<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>XML::XPathEngine - a re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
module/classes that implement trees.</p>
<p>In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to
mimic DOM nodes. The degree of similitude between the user tree and a
DOM dictates how much of the XPath features can be used. A module
implementing all of the DOM should be able to use this module very
easily (you might need to add the cmp method on nodes in order to get
ordered result sets).</p>
<p>This code is a more or less direct copy of the XML::XPath module by
Matt Sergeant. I only removed the XML processing part to remove the
dependency on XML::Parser, applied a couple of patches, renamed a whole
lot of methods to make Pod::Coverage happy, and changed the docs.</p>
<p>The article eXtending XML XPath,
http://www.xmltwig.com/article/extending_xml_xpath/ should give authors
who want to use this module enough background to do so.</p>
<p>Otherwise, my email is below ;--)</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: while the underlying code is rather solid,
this module mostly lacks docs. As they say, patches welcome...</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use XML::XPathEngine; my $tree= my_tree-&gt;new( ...); my $xp =
XML::XPathEngine-&gt;new(); my @nodeset =
$xp-&gt;find(/root/kid/grandkid[1], $tree); # find all first grankids
package XML::MyTree; # needs to provide DOM methods</p>
<h1>DETAILS</h1>
<h1>API</h1>
<p>XML::XPathEngine will provide the following methods:</p>
<h2>new</h2>
<h2>findnodes ($path, $context)</h2>
<p>Returns a list of nodes found by <code>$path</code>, optionally in
context <code>$context</code>. In scalar context returns an
XML::XPathEngine::NodeSet object.</p>
<h2>findnodes_as_string ($path, $context)</h2>
<p>Returns the nodes found as a single string. The result is not
guaranteed to be valid XML though (it could for example be just text if
the query returns attribute values).</p>
<h2>findnodes_as_strings ($path, $context)</h2>
<p>Returns the nodes found as a list of strings, one per node found.</p>
<h2>findvalue ($path, $context)</h2>
<p>Returns the result as a string (the concatenation of the values of
the result nodes).</p>
<h2>findvalues($path, $context)</h2>
<p>Returns the values of the result nodes as a list of strings.</p>
<h2>exists ($path, $context)</h2>
<p>Returns true if the given path exists.</p>
<h2>matches($node, $path, $context)</h2>
<p>Returns true if the node matches the path.</p>
<h2>find ($path, $context)</h2>
<p>The find function takes an XPath expression (a string) and returns
either a XML::XPathEngine::NodeSet object containing the nodes it found
(or empty if no nodes matched the path), or one of
XML::XPathEngine::Literal (a string), XML::XPathEngine::Number, or
XML::XPathEngine::Boolean. It should always return something - and you
can use -&gt;<strong>isa()</strong> to find out what it returned. If you
need to check how many nodes it found you should check
<code>$nodeset</code>-&gt;size. See XML::XPathEngine::NodeSet.</p>
<h2>getNodeText ($path)</h2>
<p>Returns the text string for a particular node. Returns a string, or
undef if the node doesn't exist.</p>
<h2>set_namespace ($prefix, $uri)</h2>
<p>Sets the namespace prefix mapping to the uri.</p>
<p>Normally in XML::XPathEngine the prefixes in XPath node tests take
their context from the current node. This means that foo:bar will always
match an element &lt;foo:bar&gt; regardless of the namespace that the
prefix foo is mapped to (which might even change within the document,
resulting in unexpected results). In order to make prefixes in XPath
node tests actually map to a real URI, you need to enable that via a
call to the set_namespace method of your XML::XPathEngine object.</p>
<h2>clear_namespaces ()</h2>
<p>Clears all previously set namespace mappings.</p>
<h2>get_namespace ($prefix, $node)</h2>
<p>Returns the uri associated to the prefix for the node (mostly for
internal usage)</p>
<h2>set_strict_namespaces ($strict)</h2>
<p>By default, for historical as well as convenience reasons,
XML::XPathEngine has a slightly non-standard way of dealing with the
default namespace.</p>
<p>If you search for <code>//tag</code> it will return elements
<code>tag</code>. As far as I understand it, if the document has a
default namespace, this should not return anything. You would have to
first do a <code>set_namespace</code>, and then search using the
namespace.</p>
<p>Passing a true value to <code>set_strict_namespaces</code> will
activate this behaviour, passing a false value will return it to its
default behaviour.</p>
<h2>set_var ($var. $val)</h2>
<p>Sets an XPath variable (that can be used in queries as
<code>$var</code>)</p>
<h2>get_var ($var)</h2>
<p>Returns the value of the XPath variable (mostly for internal
usage)</p>
<h2>$XML::XPathEngine::Namespaces</h2>
<p>Set this to 0 if you <em>don't</em> want namespace processing to
occur. This will make everything a little (tiny) bit faster, but you'll
suffer for it, probably.</p>
<h1>Node Object Model</h1>
<p>Nodes need to provide the same API as nodes in XML::XPath (at least
the access API, not the tree manipulation one).</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Please see the test files in t/ for examples on how to use XPath.</p>
<h1>XPath extension</h1>
<p>The module supports the XPath recommendation to the same extend as
XML::XPath (that is, rather completely).</p>
<p>It includes a perl-specific extension: direct support for regular
expressions.</p>
<p>You can use the usual (in Perl!) <code>=~</code> and <code>!~</code>
operators. Regular expressions are / delimited (no other delimiter is
accepted, \ inside regexp must be backslashed), the <code>imsx</code>
modifiers can be used.</p>
<p>$xp-&gt;findnodes( //@att[.=~ /^v.$/]); # returns the list of
attributes att # whose value matches ^v.$</p>

background information. The last section of the article summarizes how
to reuse XML::XPath. As XML::XPathEngine offers the same API it should
help you</p>
