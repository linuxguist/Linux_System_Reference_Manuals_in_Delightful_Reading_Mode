<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>wacom</strong> is an X input driver for Wacom devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>wacom</strong> driver functions as a pointer input
device.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>This driver supports the Wacom IV and Wacom V protocols. Serial
tablets only need this driver. USB tablet support is available on some
Linux platforms and requires the wacom kernel driver being loaded before
this driver starts.</p>
<p>Please check https://github.com/linuxwacom for latest updates of
Wacom X and kernel drivers.</p>
<h1>DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING</h1>
<p>When input device hotplugging in the X server is enabled and no
<strong>InputDevice</strong> section exists for a compatible tablet
device and an <strong>InputClass</strong> section (see xorg.conf.d(5x))
assigns this driver for the device, the <strong>wacom</strong> driver
creates multiple X devices for each a physical device, one X device for
each available tool. The list of tools is hardware-dependent. See
<strong>Option Type</strong> as outlined in the <strong>CONFIGURATION
DETAILS</strong> section.</p>
<p>These tool-specific devices are referred to as parent device and
dependent device. The parent device is the one presented by the system
and the one that causes the X server to load the <strong>wacom</strong>
driver. This parent device then causes the automatic addition of several
dependent devices. If the parent device is unplugged or otherwise
removed, the dependent devices will be automatically removed as
well.</p>
<p>Dependent devices may be assigned tool-specific options through
additional <strong>InputClass</strong> sections. We recommend that a
<strong>MatchDriver wacom</strong> line is used in these sections in
addition to the user-specific pattern.</p>
<p>Match directives are applied by the X server before the driver is
selected. The type name of the parent device is appended by the driver.
It is not possible to use a <strong>MatchProduct</strong> directive to
match against this appended type name.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DETAILS</h1>
<p>Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) or xorg.conf.d(5x) for general
configuration details and for options that can be used with all input
drivers. This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.</p>
<p>Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. Each device
supports the following entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Type"</em>
<em>"stylus"|"eraser"|"cursor"|"pad"|"touch"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the type of tool the device represents. This option is
mandatory. The core options, such as "SendCoreEvents" or "AlwaysCore",
are unnecessary in Gimp if you don't need to move system cursor outside
of Gimp drawing area. "pad" is for Intuos 3 or Cintiq 21UX tablet
ExpressKeys/menu strips, and Graphire 4 or Bamboo tablet buttons, wheel,
and/or ring. It is required for Intuos3, CintiqV5, Graphire 4, and
Bamboo if you want to use keystroke features. "pad" is reported as a
second tool in the driver. "touch" is for the tablet with touch support.
Right now only a few Tablet PCs have this feature.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Device"</em> <em>"path"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the path to the special file which represents serial line where
the tablet is plugged. You have to specify it for each subsection with
the same value if you want to have multiple devices with the same
tablet. This option is mandatory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Suppress"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the position increment under which not to transmit coordinates.
This entry must be specified only in the first Wacom subsection if you
have multiple devices for one tablet. If you don't specify this entry,
the default value, which is 2, will be used. To disable suppression, the
entry should be specified as 0. When suppress is defined, an event will
be sent only when at least one of the following conditions is met:</p>
<p>the change between the current X coordinate and the previous one is
greater than suppress;</p>
<p>the change between the current Y coordinate and the previous one is
greater than suppress;</p>
<p>the change between the current pressure and the previous one is
greater than suppress;</p>
<p>the change between the current degree of rotation and the previous
one of the transducer is greater than suppress;</p>
<p>the change between the current absolute wheel value and the previous
one is equal to or greater than suppress;</p>
<p>the change between the current tilt value and the previous one is
equal to or greater than suppress (if tilt is supported);</p>
<p>relative wheel value has changed;</p>
<p>button value has changed;</p>
<p>proximity has changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Mode"</em>
<em>"Relative"|"Absolute"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the mode of the device. The default value for stylus, pad and
eraser is Absolute; cursor is Relative; touch defaults to Relative for
tablets with touch pads and Absolute for touch screens.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"TopX"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone. Default to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"TopY"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone. Default to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"BottomX"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone. Default to
width of the tablet.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"BottomY"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone. Default to
height of the tablet.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"ButtonsOnly"</em>
<em>"on"|"off"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>disables the device's motion events. Default to off.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"ButtonM"</em> <em>"AC"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>reports an action AC when button M is pressed, where M is one of the
device supported button numbers, it can be 1 to 32. Wacom uses a
driver-internal button mapping, where any physical button appears to the
X server as the button specified by the ButtonM mapping. Hence, if two
physical buttons have the same ButtonM mapping, the server will think
they are the same physical button. The default action reported to the X
server is mouse button M click. Because X uses buttons 4, 5, 6, and 7 as
the four scrolling directions, physical buttons 4 and higher are mapped
to 8 and higher by default. Only simple button presses can be configured
here; for more complex actions, use xsetwacom(1). To ignore the button
click, i.e., to not report any button click event to the X server, use
"0" or "button 0".</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"TPCButton"</em>
<em>"on"|"off"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>enables the stylus buttons as Tablet PC buttons. If enabled, the
stylus reports button events only when its tip is pressed. If any button
is down, pressing the tip reports a button event for the button.
Otherwise if no button is down, the tip reports as usual. Default to
"on" for Tablet PCs; "off" for all other models. Only available on the
stylus tool.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Touch"</em> <em>"on"|"off"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>enables touch events for touch devices, i.e., system cursor moves
when user touches the tablet. Default to "on" for devices that support
touch; "off" for all other models.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Rotate"</em>
<em>"CW"|"CCW"|"HALF"|"NONE"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>rotates the tablet orientation counterclockwise (CCW) or clockwise
(CW) or 180 degrees (HALF). If you have specific tablet mappings, i.e.
TopX/Y or BottomX/Y were set, the mapping will be applied before
rotation. Rotation must be applied to the parent device (usually the
stylus), rotation settings on in-driver hotplugged devices (see
<strong>DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING</strong> ) will be ignored.
The default is "NONE".</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"PressCurve"</em>
<em>"x1,y1,x2,y2"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets pressure curve by control points x1, y1, x2, and y2. Their
values are in range from 0..100. The pressure curve is interpreted as
Bezier curve with 4 control points, the first and the last control point
being fixed on the coordinates 0/0 and 100/100, respectively. The middle
control points are adjustible by this setting and thus define the shape
of the curve. The input for linear curve (default) is "0,0,100,100";
slightly depressed curve (firmer) might be "5,0,100,95"; slightly raised
curve (softer) might be "0,5,95,100". The pressure curve is only
applicable to devices of type stylus or eraser, other devices do not
honor this setting.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Pressure2K"</em> <em>"bool"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>reduces the pressure range to the range of 0 to 2048 for backwards
compatibility with applications that have this range hardcoded. See
section <strong>BUGS.</strong> This option should not be used unless the
user runs one or more applications that rely on a hardcoded pressure
range.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"DebugLevel"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the level of debugging info for tool-specific messages. There
are 12 levels, specified by the integers between 1 and 12. All debug
messages with a level less than or equal to the "number" will be logged
into the Xorg log file. This option is only available if the driver was
built with debugging support.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"CommonDBG"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the level of debugging info for common (i.e. not tool-specific)
code paths on the tablet. There are 12 levels, specified by the integers
between 1 and 12. All debug messages with a level less than or equal to
the "number" will be logged into the Xorg log file. This option is only
available if the driver was built with debugging support.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"GrabDevice"</em> <em>"bool"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets whether the underlying event device will be grabbed by the
driver to prevent the data from leaking to /dev/input/mice. When
enabled, while the X server is running, no other programs will be able
to read the event stream. Default: "false".</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"CursorProx"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the distance at which a relative tool is treated as being out of
proximity. Beyond this distance the cursor will stop responding to tool
motion. The default value for pucks is 10 (Intuos Pro) or 42
(Intuos/Bamboo). The default value for pens is 30.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"RawSample"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the sample window size (a sliding average sampling window) for
incoming input tool raw data points. Default: 4, range of 1 to 20.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Serial"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the serial number associated with the physical device. This
allows to have multiple devices of the same type (i.e. multiple pens).
This option is only available on wacom V devices (Intuos series and
Cintiq 21U). To see which serial number belongs to a device, you need to
run the utility program, xsetwacom, which comes with linuxwacom
package.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"ToolSerials"</em>
<em>"number[,type[,label]][;...]"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the list of serial numbered devices that need to be hotplugged
for a physical device. The 'type' option may be any of "pen",
"airbrush", "artpen", or "cursor". This option is only available on
wacom V devices which are capable of reporting a serial number. To see
if a connected device is supported, or to identify which serial number
belongs to a device, you need to run the utility program, xsetwacom,
that comes with this driver. In layman's terms, this option will add
additional X devices for this specific tool's tip (and eraser, if
applicable). This is useful for programs like gimp (which remembers
tools based on the X device) to recall additional drawing tool
selections for an airbrush+eraser, art pen, extra pen, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Threshold"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>sets the pressure threshold used to generate a button 1 events of
stylus. The threshold applies to the normalised pressure range of
[0..2048]. The default is 27.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"Gesture"</em> <em>"bool"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable or disable multi-finger in-driver gesture support on the
device. Default: off unless the tablet supports multi-touch. Note that
disabling this option may allow the desktop environment to detect
multi-finger gestures instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"ZoomDistance"</em>
<em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>Option <em>"Gesture"</em></strong> is enabled, this option
specifies the minimum movement distance before a zoom gesture is
recognized.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"ScrollDistance"</em>
<em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>Option <em>"Gesture"</em></strong> is enabled, this option
specifies the minimum movement distance before a scroll gesture is
recognized.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"TapTime"</em> <em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>Option <em>"Gesture"</em></strong> is enabled, this option
determines the maximum time of a touch event to be recognized as tap. A
press and release event shorter than <strong>TapTime</strong> generates
button press and release events. Presses longer than
<strong>TapTime</strong> do not generate button events, only motion
events.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"PressureRecalibration"</em>
<em>"bool"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows to disable pressure recalibration. Default: true. If the
initial pressure of a device is != 0 the driver recalibrates the
pressure range. This is to account for worn out devices. The downside is
that when the user hits the tablet very hard the initial pressure
reading may be unequal to zero even for a perfectly good pen. If the
consecutive pressure readings are not higher than the initial pressure
by a threshold no button event will be generated. This option allows to
disable the recalibration.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option <em>"PanScrollThreshold"</em>
<em>"number"</em></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the distance the pen must move (in tablet units) before a
scroll event is generated when using the "pan" action. Smaller values
will require less distance and be more sensitive. Larger values will
require more distance and be less sensitive. Default: 1300 or 2600
depending on tablet resolution (corresponds to 13 mm of distance).</p>
</dd>

<h1>TOUCH GESTURES</h1>
<h2>Single finger (1FG)</h2>
<p><strong>Left click:</strong> tap, actual click happens after TapTime
period elapses.</p>
<p><strong>Left click drag:</strong> tap to select, quickly (within
TapTime period) touch selection again. Then drag. Available on
touchpads, e.g. BambooPT, not touchscreens.</p>
<h2>Two finger (2FG)</h2>
<p><strong>Right click:</strong> one finger down + tap second finger</p>
<p><strong>Vertical scroll:</strong> two fingers side by side (in any
orientation) moving vertically with constant separation initiates a
vertical scroll. By driver default a gesture up results in a scroll down
event (the document moves up) and a gesture down results in a scroll up
event (moving the document down).</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal scroll:</strong> two fingers side by side held at
a constant distance moving horizontally initiates a horizontal scroll. A
gesture to the left results in a scroll right event (the document moves
left) and a gesture right results in a scroll left event (moving the
document right).</p>
<p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> two separated fingers side by side, bring
together i.e. pinch.</p>
<p><strong>Zoom out:</strong> two fingers side by side, spread. Not all
applications support zoom.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<h2>Pressure range increase leads to unexpected behavior</h2>
<p>In version 0.34, the driver's pressure range increased from 2048
steps to 65536 steps. The pressure axis range is advertised through the
X Input Protocol but some applications have the previous pressure range
hardcoded and cannot handle pressure values above 2048. This is an
application bug but for backwards-compatibility with such applications,
this driver provides the <strong>Pressure2K</strong> option to reduce
the range to 2048 steps. Note that this setting applies to the device.
Once applied, all applications will see the reduced pressure range. It
is not possible to provide this setting on a per-application basis.</p>
