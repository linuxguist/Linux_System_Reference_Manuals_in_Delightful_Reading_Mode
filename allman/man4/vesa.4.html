<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>Section Device
 Identifier devname
 Driver vesa
  ...
EndSection</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>vesa</strong> is an Xorg driver for generic VESA video cards.
It can drive most VESA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of the
basic standard VESA core that is common to these cards. The driver
supports depths 8, 15 16 and 24.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>The <strong>vesa</strong> driver supports most VESA-compatible video
cards. There are some known exceptions, and those should be listed
here.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DETAILS</h1>
<p>Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.</p>
<p>The driver auto-detects the presence of VESA-compatible hardware. The
<strong>ChipSet</strong> name may optionally be specified in the config
file <strong>Device</strong> section, and will override the
auto-detection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"vesa"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following driver <strong>Options</strong> are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Option ShadowFB
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Default:
on.</p>
<p>This option is recommended for performance reasons.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option ModeSetClearScreen
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Clear the screen on mode set. Some BIOSes seem to be broken in the
sense that the newly set video mode is bogus if they are asked to clear
the screen during mode setting. If you experience problems try to turn
this option off. Default: on.</p>
