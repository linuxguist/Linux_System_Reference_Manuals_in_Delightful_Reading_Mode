<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>modesetting - video driver for framebuffer device</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>Section Device
 Identifier devname
 Driver modesetting
 BusID pci:bus:dev:func
  ...
EndSection</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>modesetting</strong> is an Xorg driver for KMS devices. This
driver supports TrueColor visuals at framebuffer depths of 15, 16, 24,
and 30. RandR 1.2 is supported for multi-head configurations.
Acceleration is available through glamor for devices supporting at least
OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL 2.1. If glamor is not enabled, a shadow
framebuffer is configured based on the KMS drivers' preference (unless
the framebuffer is 24 bits per pixel, in which case the shadow
framebuffer is always used).</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p>The <strong>modesetting</strong> driver supports all hardware where a
KMS driver is available. modesetting uses the Linux DRM KMS ioctls and
dumb object create/map.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DETAILS</h1>
<p>Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.</p>
<p>For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the screen
section of the config file. The <strong>modesetting</strong> driver can
pick up the currently used video mode from the kernel driver and will
use it if there are no video modes configured.</p>
<p>For PCI boards you might have to add a BusID line to the Device
section. See above for a sample line.</p>
<p>The following driver <strong>Options</strong> are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Option SWcursor
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects software cursor. The default is <strong>off.</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option kmsdev </strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The framebuffer device to use. Default: /dev/dri/card0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option ShadowFB
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Default:
on.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option DoubleShadow
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Double-buffer shadow updates. When enabled, the driver will keep two
copies of the shadow framebuffer. When the shadow framebuffer is
flushed, the old and new versions of the shadow are compared, and only
tiles that have actually changed are uploaded to the device. This is an
optimization for server-class GPUs with a remote display function
(typically VNC), where remote updates are triggered by any framebuffer
write, so minimizing the amount of data uploaded is crucial. This
defaults to enabled for ASPEED and Matrox G200 devices, and disabled
otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option AccelMethod
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>One of glamor or none. Default: glamor.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option PageFlip
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable DRI3 page flipping. The default is <strong>on.</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option VariableRefresh
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables support for enabling variable refresh on the Screen's CRTCs
when an suitable application is flipping via the Present
extension.<br />
The default is <strong>off.</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option AsyncFlipSecondaries
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use async flips for secondary video outputs on multi-display setups.
If a screen has multiple displays attached and DRI3 page flipping is
used, then only one of the displays will have its page flip synchronized
to vblank for tear-free presentation. This is the display that is used
for presentation timing and timestamping, usually the one covering the
biggest pixel area of the screen. All other displays ("Secondaries")
will not synchronize their flips. This may cause some tearing on these
displays, but it prevents a permanent or periodic slowdown or irritating
judder of animations if not all video outputs are running synchronized
with each other and with the same refresh rate. There is no perfect
solution apart from perfectly synchronized outputs, but this option may
give preferrable results if the displays in a multi-display setup mirror
or clone each other. The default is <strong>off.</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option ZaphodHeads
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the RandR output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particular
driver instance. If you use this option you must use this option for all
instances of the driver.<br />
For example: <strong>Option ZaphodHeads LVDS,VGA-0</strong> will assign
xrandr outputs LVDS and VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option UseGammaLUT
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable or disable use of the GAMMA_LUT property, when available. When
enabled, this option allows the driver to use gamma ramps with more
entries, if supported by the kernel. By default, GAMMA_LUT will be used
for kms drivers which are known to be safe for use of GAMMA_LUT.</p>
