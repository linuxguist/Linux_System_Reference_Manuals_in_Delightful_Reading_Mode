<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>tty - controlling terminal</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The file <em>/dev/tty</em> is a character file with major number 5
and minor number 0, usually with mode 0666 and ownership root:tty. It is
a synonym for the controlling terminal of a process, if any.</p>
<p>In addition to the <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) requests supported by
the device that <strong>tty</strong> refers to, the
<strong>ioctl</strong>(2) request <strong>TIOCNOTTY</strong> is
supported.</p>
<h2>TIOCNOTTY</h2>
<p>Detach the calling process from its controlling terminal.</p>
<p>If the process is the session leader, then <strong>SIGHUP</strong>
and <strong>SIGCONT</strong> signals are sent to the foreground process
group and all processes in the current session lose their controlling
tty.</p>
<p>This <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) call works only on file descriptors
connected to <em>/dev/tty</em>. It is used by daemon processes when they
are invoked by a user at a terminal. The process attempts to open
<em>/dev/tty</em>. If the open succeeds, it detaches itself from the
terminal by using <strong>TIOCNOTTY</strong>, while if the open fails,
it is obviously not attached to a terminal and does not need to detach
itself.</p>
