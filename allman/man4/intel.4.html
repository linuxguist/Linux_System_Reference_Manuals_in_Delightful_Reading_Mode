EndSection</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>intel</strong> is an Xorg driver for Intel integrated
graphics chipsets. The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24. All
visual types are supported in depth 8. For the i810/i815 other depths
support the TrueColor and DirectColor visuals. For the i830M and later,
only the TrueColor visual is supported for depths greater than 8. The
driver supports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct Rendering
Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16 for the i810/i815 and depths
16 and 24 for the 830M and later.</p>
<h1>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</h1>
<p><strong>intel</strong> supports the i810, i810-DC100, i810e, i815,
i830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 915GM, 945G, 945GM, 965G, 965Q,
946GZ, 965GM, 945GME, G33, Q33, Q35, G35, GM45, G45, Q45, G43, G41

series, Intel(R) HD Graphics, Intel(R) Iris(TM) Graphics, Intel(R)
Iris(TM) Pro Graphics.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DETAILS</h1>
<p>Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.</p>
<p>The Intel 8xx and 9xx families of integrated graphics chipsets have a
unified memory architecture meaning that system memory is used as video
RAM. For the i810 and i815 family of chipsets, operating system support
for allocating system memory is required in order to use this driver.
For the 830M and later, this is required in order for the driver to use
more video RAM than has been pre-allocated at boot time by the BIOS.
This is usually achieved with an "agpgart" or "agp" kernel driver.
Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris have such kernel drivers
available.</p>
<p>By default, the i810/i815 will use 8 MB of system memory for graphics
if AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128 MB, 16 MB if &lt; 192 MB or 24 MB if
higher. Use the <strong>VideoRam</strong> option to change the default
value.</p>
<p>For the 830M and later, the driver will automatically size its memory
allocation according to the features it will support. Therefore, the
<strong>VideoRam</strong> option, which in the past had been necessary
to allow more than some small amount of memory to be allocated, is now
ignored.</p>
<p>The following driver <strong>Options</strong> are supported</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Option ColorKey
</strong><em>integer</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.</p>
<p>Default: undefined.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option DRI </strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable or enable DRI support. A driver name to use can be provided
instead of simple boolean value, which will be passed to the GL
implementation for it to load the appropriate backend. Alternatively the
maximum level of DRI to enable (e.g. "1", "2" or "3") can be
specified.</p>
<p>Default: All levels of DRI are enabled for configurations where it is
supported.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following driver <strong>Options</strong> are supported for the
i810 and i815 chipsets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Option CacheLines
</strong><em>integer</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This allows the user to change the amount of graphics memory used for
2D acceleration and video when XAA acceleration is enabled. Decreasing
this amount leaves more for 3D textures. Increasing it can improve 2D
performance at the expense of 3D performance.</p>
<p>Default: depends on the resolution, depth, and available video
memory. The driver attempts to allocate space for at 3 screenfuls of
pixmaps plus an HD-sized XV video. The default used for a specific
configuration can be found by examining the Xorg log file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option DDC </strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable or enable DDC support.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Dac6Bit
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable or disable 6-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>
<p>Default: 8-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option XvMCSurfaces
</strong><em>integer</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option enables XvMC. The integer parameter specifies the number
of surfaces to use. Valid values are 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Default: XvMC is disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>VideoRam </strong><em>integer</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option specifies the amount of system memory to use for
graphics, in KB.</p>
<p>The default is 8192 if AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128 MB, 16384 if
&lt; 192 MB, 24576 if higher. DRI require at least a value of 16384.
Higher values may give better 3D performance, at expense of available
system memory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Accel </strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable or disable acceleration.</p>
<p>Default: acceleration is enabled.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following driver <strong>Options</strong> are supported for the
830M and later chipsets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Option Accel </strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable or disable acceleration.</p>
<p>Default: acceleration is enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Present
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable use of hardware counters and flow control for the Present
extension.</p>
<p>Default: Enabled</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option AccelMethod
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Select acceleration method. There are a couple of backends available
for accelerating the DDX. UXA (Unified Acceleration Architecture) is the
mature backend that was introduced to support the GEM driver model. It
is in the process of being superseded by SNA (Sandybridge's New
Acceleration). Until that process is complete, the ability to choose
which backend to use remains for backwards compatibility. In addition,
there are a pair of sub-options to limit the acceleration for debugging
use. Specify off or none to disable all acceleration, or blt to disable
render acceleration and only use the BLT engine.</p>
<p>Default: use SNA (render acceleration)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option TearFree
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable or enable TearFree updates. This option forces X to perform
all rendering to a backbuffer prior to updating the actual display. It
requires an extra memory allocation the same size as a framebuffer, the
occasional extra copy, and requires Damage tracking. Thus enabling
TearFree requires more memory and is slower (reduced throughput) and
introduces a small amount of output latency, but it should not impact
input latency. However, the update to the screen is then performed
synchronously with the vertical refresh of the display so that the
entire update is completed before the display starts its refresh. That
is only one frame is ever visible, preventing an unsightly tear between
two visible and differing frames. Note that this replicates what the
compositing manager should be doing, however TearFree will redirect the
compositor updates (and those of fullscreen games) directly on to the
scanout thus incurring no additional overhead in the composited case.
Also note that not all compositing managers prevent tearing, and if the
outputs are rotated, there will still be tearing without TearFree
enabled.</p>
<p>Default: TearFree is disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option ReprobeOutputs
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable or enable rediscovery of connected displays during server
startup. As the kernel driver loads it scans for connected displays and
configures a console spanning those outputs. When the X server starts,
we then take the list of connected displays and framebuffer layout and
use that for the initial configuration. Sometimes, not all displays are
correctly detected by the kernel and so it is useful in a few
circumstances for X to force the kernel to reprobe all displays when it
starts. To make the X server recheck the status of connected displays,
set the ReprobeOutputs option to true. Please do file a bug for any
circumstances which require this workaround.</p>
<p>Default: reprobing is disabled for a faster startup.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option VideoKey
</strong><em>integer</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the same as the <strong>ColorKey</strong> option described
above. It is provided for compatibility with most other drivers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option XvPreferOverlay
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Make hardware overlay be the first XV adaptor. The overlay behaves
incorrectly in the presence of compositing, but some prefer it due to it
syncing to vblank in the absence of compositing. While most XV-using
applications have options to select which XV adaptor to use, this option
can be used to place the overlay first for applications which don't have
options for selecting adaptors.</p>
<p>Default: Textured video adaptor is preferred.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Backlight
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Override the probed backlight control interface. Sometimes the
automatically selected backlight interface may not correspond to the
correct, or simply most useful, interface available on the system. This
allows you to override that choice by specifying the entry under
/sys/class/backlight to use.</p>
<p>Default: Automatic selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option CustomEDID
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Override the probed EDID on particular outputs. Sometimes the
manufacturer supplied EDID is corrupt or lacking a few usable modes and
supplying a corrected EDID may be easier than specifying every modeline.
This option allows to pass the path to load an EDID from per output. The
format is a comma separated string of output:path pairs, e.g.
DP1:/path/to/dp1.edid,DP2:/path/to/dp2.edid</p>
<p>Default: No override, use manufacturer supplied EDIDs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option FallbackDebug
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable printing of debugging information on acceleration fallbacks to
the server log.</p>
<p>Default: Disabled</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option DebugFlushBatches
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Flush the batch buffer after every single operation.</p>
<p>Default: Disabled</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option DebugFlushCaches
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Include an MI_FLUSH at the end of every batch buffer to force data to
be flushed out of cache and into memory before the completion of the
batch.</p>
<p>Default: Disabled</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option DebugWait
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Wait for the completion of every batch buffer before continuing, i.e.
perform synchronous rendering.</p>
<p>Default: Disabled</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option HWRotation
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Override the use of native hardware rotation and force the use of
software, but GPU accelerated where possible, rotation. On some
platforms the hardware can scanout directly into a rotated output
bypassing the intermediate rendering and extra allocations required for
software implemented rotation (i.e. native rotation uses less resources,
is quicker and uses less power). This allows you to disable the native
rotation in case of errors.</p>
<p>Default: Enabled (use hardware rotation)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option VSync </strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls the use of commands to synchronise rendering
with the vertical refresh of the display. Some rendering commands have
the option to be performed in a "tear-free" fashion by stalling the GPU
to wait for the display to be outside of the region to be updated. This
slows down all rendering, and historically has been the source of many
GPU hangs.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option PageFlip
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls the use of commands to flip the scanout address
on a VBlank. This is used by glXSwapBuffers to efficiently perform the
back-to-front exchange at the end of a frame without incurring the
penalty of a copy, or stalling the render pipeline (the flip is
performed asynchronrously to the render command stream by the display
engine). However, it has historically been the source of many GPU
hangs.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option SwapbuffersWait
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls the behavior of glXSwapBuffers and
glXCopySubBufferMESA calls by GL applications. If enabled, the calls
will avoid tearing by making sure the display scanline is outside of the
area to be copied before the copy occurs. If disabled, no scanline
synchronization is performed, meaning tearing will likely occur.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option TripleBuffer
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option enables the use of a third buffer for page-flipping. The
third buffer allows applications to run at vrefresh rates even if they
occasionally fail to swapbuffers on time. The effect of such missed
swaps is the output jitters between 60fps and 30fps, and in the worst
case appears frame-locked to 30fps. The disadvantage of triple buffering
is that there is an extra frame of latency, due to the pre-rendered
frame sitting in the swap queue, between input and any display
update.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Tiling
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls whether memory buffers for Pixmaps are allocated
in tiled mode. In most cases (especially for complex rendering), tiling
dramatically improves performance.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option LinearFramebuffer
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls whether the memory for the scanout (also known
as the front or frame buffer) is allocated in linear memory. A tiled
framebuffer is required for power conservation features, but for certain
system configurations you may wish to override this and force a linear
layout.</p>
<p>Default: disabled</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option RelaxedFencing
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls whether we attempt to allocate the minimal
amount of memory required for the buffers. The reduction in working set
has a substantial improvement on system performance. However, this has
been demonstrate to be buggy on older hardware (845-865 and 915-945, but
ok on PineView and later) so on those chipsets defaults to off.</p>
<p>Default: Enabled for G33 (includes PineView), and later, class
machines.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option XvMC </strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enable XvMC driver. Current support MPEG2 MC on 915/945 and G33
series. User should provide absolute path to libIntelXvMC.so in
XvMCConfig file.</p>
<p>Default: Disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Throttle
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls whether the driver periodically waits for
pending drawing operations to complete. Throttling ensures that the GPU
does not lag too far behind the CPU and thus noticeable delays in user
responsible at the cost of throughput performance.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option HotPlug
</strong><em>boolean</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls whether the driver automatically notifies
applications when monitors are connected or disconnected.</p>
<p>Default: enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Virtualheads
</strong><em>integer</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls specifies the number of fake outputs to create
in addition to the normal outputs detected on your hardware. These
outputs cannot be assigned to the regular displays attached to the GPU,
but do otherwise act as any other xrandr output and share a portion of
the regular framebuffer. One use case for these extra heads is for
extending your desktop onto a discrete GPU using the Bumblebee project.
However, the recommendation here is to use PRIME instead to create a
single Xserver that can addresses and coordinate between multiple
GPUs.</p>
<p>Default: 0</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option ZaphodHeads
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the randr output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particular
driver instance. If you set this option you must use it with all
instances of the driver. By default, each head is assigned only one CRTC
(which limits using multiple outputs with that head to cloned mode).
CRTC can be manually assigned to individual heads by preceding the
output names with a comma delimited list of pipe numbers followed by a
colon. Note that different pipes may be limited in their functionality
and some outputs may only work with different pipes.<br />
For example:</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Option ZaphodHeads LVDS1,VGA1</strong></p>
<p>will assign xrandr outputs LVDS1 and VGA1 to this instance of the
driver.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Option ZaphodHeads 0,2:HDMI1,DP2</strong></p>
<p>will assign xrandr outputs HDMI1 and DP2 and CRTCs 0 and 2 to this
instance of the driver.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>OUTPUT CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>On 830M and better chipsets, the driver supports runtime
configuration of detected outputs. You can use the
<strong>xrandr</strong> tool to control outputs on the command line as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>xrandr --output</strong> <em>output</em>
<strong>--set</strong> <em>property value</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that you may need to quote property and value arguments that
contain spaces. Each output listed below may have one or more properties
associated with it (like a binary EDID block if one is found). Some
outputs have unique properties which are described below. See the
"MULTIHEAD CONFIGURATIONS" section below for additional information.</p>
<h2>VGA</h2>
<p>VGA output port (typically exposed via an HD15 connector).</p>
<h2>LVDS</h2>
<p>Low Voltage Differential Signalling output (typically a laptop LCD
panel). Available properties:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>BACKLIGHT - current backlight level
(adjustable)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>By adjusting the BACKLIGHT property, the brightness on the LVDS
output can be adjusted. In some cases, this property may be unavailable
(for example if your platform uses an external microcontroller to
control the backlight).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>scaling mode - control LCD panel scaling mode</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When the currently selected display mode differs from the native
panel resolution, various scaling options are available. These
include</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Center</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Simply center the image on-screen without scaling. This is the only
scaling mode that guarantees a one-to-one correspondence between native
and displayed pixels, but some portions of the panel may be unused
(so-called "letterboxing").</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Full aspect</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Scale the image as much as possible while preserving aspect ratio.
Pixels may not be displayed one-to-one (there may be some blurriness).
Some portions of the panel may be unused if the aspect ratio of the
selected mode does not match that of the panel.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Full</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Scale the image to the panel size without regard to aspect ratio.
This is the only mode which guarantees that every pixel of the panel
will be used. But the displayed image may be distorted by stretching
either horizontally or vertically, and pixels may not be displayed
one-to-one (there may be some blurriness).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The precise names of these options may differ depending on the kernel
video driver, (but the functionality should be similar). See the output
of <strong>xrandr --prop</strong> for a list of currently available
scaling modes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>TV</h2>
<p>Integrated TV output. Available properties include:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>BOTTOM, RIGHT, TOP, LEFT - margins</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusting these properties allows you to control the placement of
your TV output buffer on the screen. The options with the same name can
also be set in xorg.conf with integer value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>BRIGHTNESS - TV brightness, range 0-255</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjust TV brightness, default value is 128.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CONTRAST - TV contrast, range 0-255</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjust TV contrast, default value is 1.0 in chipset specific
format.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SATURATION - TV saturation, range 0-255</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjust TV saturation, default value is 1.0 in chipset specific
format.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>HUE - TV hue, range 0-255</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjust TV hue, default value is 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TV_FORMAT - output standard</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This property allows you to control the output standard used on your
TV output port. You can select between NTSC-M, NTSC-443, NTSC-J, PAL-M,
PAL-N, and PAL.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TV_Connector - connector type</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This config option should be added to xorg.conf TV monitor's section,
it allows you to force the TV output connector type, which bypass load
detect and TV will always be taken as connected. You can select between
S-Video, Composite and Component.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>TMDS-1</h2>
<p>First DVI SDVO output</p>
<h2>TMDS-2</h2>
<p>Second DVI SDVO output</p>
<h2>TMDS-1 , TMDS-2 , HDMI-1 , HDMI-2</h2>
<p>DVI/HDMI outputs. Available common properties include:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>BROADCAST_RGB - method used to set RGB color
range</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusting this property allows you to set RGB color range on each
channel in order to match HDTV requirement(default 0 for full range).
Setting 1 means RGB color range is 16-235, 0 means RGB color range is
0-255 on each channel. (Full range is 0-255, not 16-235)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>SDVO and DVO TV outputs are not supported by the driver at this
time.</p>
<p>See xorg.conf(5) for information on associating Monitor sections with
these outputs for configuration. Associating Monitor sections with each
output can be helpful if you need to ignore a specific output, for
example, or statically configure an extended desktop monitor layout.</p>
<h1>MULTIHEAD CONFIGURATIONS</h1>
<p>The number of independent outputs is dictated by the number of CRTCs
(in X parlance) a given chip supports. Most recent Intel chips have two
CRTCs, meaning that two separate framebuffers can be displayed
simultaneously, in an extended desktop configuration. If a chip supports
more outputs than it has CRTCs (say local flat panel, VGA and TV in the
case of many outputs), two of the outputs will have to be "cloned",
meaning that they display the same framebuffer contents (or one displays
a subset of another's framebuffer if the modes aren't equal).</p>
<p>You can use the "xrandr" tool, or various desktop utilities, to
change your output configuration at runtime. To statically configure
your outputs, you can use the "Monitor-&lt;type&gt;" options along with
additional monitor sections in your xorg.conf to create your screen
topology. The example below puts the VGA output to the right of the
builtin laptop screen, both running at 1024x768.</p>

</code></pre>
<h1>TEXTURED VIDEO ATTRIBUTES</h1>
<p>The driver supports the following X11 Xv attributes for Textured
Video. You can use the "xvattr" tool to query/set those attributes at
runtime.</p>
<h2>XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK</h2>
<p>XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK is used to control whether textured adapter
synchronizes the screen update to the vblank to eliminate tearing. It is
a Boolean attribute with values of 0 (never sync) or 1 (always sync). An
historic value of -1 (sync for large windows only) will now be
interpreted as 1, (since the current approach for sync is not costly
even with small video windows).</p>
<h2>XV_BRIGHTNESS</h2>

<h2>XV_CONTRAST</h2>

<h1>REPORTING BUGS</h1>
<p>The xf86-video-intel driver is part of the X.Org and Freedesktop.org
umbrella projects. Details on bug reporting can be found at
https://01.org/linuxgraphics/documentation/how-report-bugs. Mailing
lists are also commonly used to report experiences and ask questions
about configuration and other topics. See lists.freedesktop.org for more
information (the xorg@lists.freedesktop.org mailing list is the most
appropriate place to ask X.Org and driver related questions).</p>
