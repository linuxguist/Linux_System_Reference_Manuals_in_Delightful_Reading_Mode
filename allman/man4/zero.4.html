<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>null, zero - data sink</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Data written to the <em>/dev/null</em> and <em>/dev/zero</em> special
files is discarded.</p>
<p>Reads from <em>/dev/null</em> always return end of file (i.e.,
<strong>read</strong>(2) returns 0), whereas reads from
<em>/dev/zero</em> always return bytes containing zero ('\0'
characters).</p>
<p>These devices are typically created by:</p>
<pre><code>mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
chown root:root /dev/null /dev/zero</code></pre>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p><em>/dev/null</em><br />
<em>/dev/zero</em></p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>If these devices are not writable and readable for all users, many
programs will act strangely.</p>
<p>Since Linux 2.6.31, reads from <em>/dev/zero</em> are interruptible
by signals. (This change was made to help with bad latencies for large
reads from <em>/dev/zero</em>.)</p>

<strong>full</strong>(4)</p>
