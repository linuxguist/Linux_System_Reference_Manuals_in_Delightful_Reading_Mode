<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>msr - x86 CPU MSR access device</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr</em> provides an interface to read and write
the model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU. <em>CPUNUM</em> is
the number of the CPU to access as listed in <em>/proc/cpuinfo</em>.</p>
<p>The register access is done by opening the file and seeking to the
MSR number as offset in the file, and then reading or writing in chunks
of 8 bytes. An I/O transfer of more than 8 bytes means multiple reads or
writes of the same register.</p>
<p>This file is protected so that it can be read and written only by the
user <em>root</em>, or members of the group <em>root</em>.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The <em>msr</em> driver is not auto-loaded. On modular kernels you
might need to use the following command to load it explicitly before
use:</p>
<pre><code>$ modprobe msr</code></pre>

CPU MSRs.</p>
