<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>inputtest - An X.Org input driver for testing</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>Section InputDevice
 Identifier devname
 Driver inputtest
 Option SocketPath path
  ...
EndSection</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>inputtest</strong> is an Xorg input driver that passes events
received over a socket on to the server as input events. It supports the
full set of the xf86 driver APIs exposed by Xorg. The primary use cases
of this input driver are various integration tests that need to
interface with the input subsystem.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DETAILS</h1>
<p>Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and
for options that can be used with all input drivers. This section only
covers configuration details specific to this driver.</p>
<p>External process can communicate with the input driver via a named
socket that is created after the driver is initialized. The paths to the
socket is passed via input driver options.</p>
<p>The following driver <strong>Options</strong> are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Option SocketPath
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the path where the driver will create a named socket. Any
existing file at that location will be removed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option DeviceType
</strong><em>string</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the type of the device to be emulated.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard</strong> Initializes a keyboard device.</p>
<p><strong>Pointer</strong> Initializes a relative-mode pointer device.
It will have four valuators - a "Rel X" valuator at axis 0 and a "Rel Y"
valuator at axis 1. A horizontal scroll valuator will be set up at axis
2. A vertical scroll valuator will be set up at axis 3.</p>
<p><strong>PointerAbsolute</strong> Initializes an absolute-mode pointer
device. It will have four valuators - an "Abs X" valuator at axis 0 and
an "Abs Y" valuator at axis 1. A horizontal scroll valuator will be set
up at axis 2. A vertical scroll valuator will be set up at axis 3.</p>
<p><strong>PointerAbsoluteProximity</strong> Initializes an
absolute-mode pointer device with proximity support. The valuators are
initialized in the same way as for <strong>PointerAbsolute</strong>
type.</p>
<p><strong>Touch</strong> Initializes a touch device. It will have 5
valuators: an "Abs MT Position X" at axis 0, an "Abs MT Position Y"
valuator at axis 1, a horizontal scroll valuator on axis 2, a vertical
scroll valuator on axis 3 and an "Abs MT Pressure" valuator at axis
4.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option TouchCount
</strong><em>int</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the maximum number of simultaneous touches for touch
devices.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option PointerButtonCount
</strong><em>int</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the maximum number of buttons in pointer devices.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Option PointerHasPressure
</strong><em>bool</em><strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects whether "Abs Pressure" is available at the axis 4 in pointer
devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>INTERFACE WITH THE DRIVER</h1>
<p>The communication with the driver is a binary protocol defined in
include/xf86-input-inputtest-protocol.h</p>
<p>At the beginning, the client process that communicates with the
driver must connect to the socket that is created by the driver at
SocketPath. Once the connection is established, it must write a
xf86ITEventClientVersion event and read a xf86ITResponseServerVersion
response where the driver specifies the protocol version supported by
it. If this version is lower than requested by the client, then the
driver will disconnect.</p>
<p>After receiving xf86ITResponseServerVersion message the client may
send events to the driver. Each event is an instance of one of the
<strong>xf86ITEvent*</strong> structs. The length field defines the full
length of the struct in bytes and the event field defines the type of
the struct.</p>
<p>The responses from the server follow the same structure. Each
response is an instance of one of the <strong>xf86ITResponse*</strong>
structs. The length field defines the full length of the struct in bytes
and the event field defines the type of the struct.</p>
<p>The synchronization with Xorg is performed via
<strong>xf86ITEventWaitForSync</strong> event. After sending such event,
the client must read of a
<strong>xf86ITResponseSyncFinished</strong><em>event</em><strong>from</strong><em>the</em><strong>socket</strong><em>without</em><strong>sending</strong><em>additional</em>
events. The completion of the read operation indicates that Xorg has
fully processed all input events sent to it so far.</p>
